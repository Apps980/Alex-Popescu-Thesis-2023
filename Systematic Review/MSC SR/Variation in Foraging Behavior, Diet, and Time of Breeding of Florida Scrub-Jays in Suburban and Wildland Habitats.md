title: Variation in Foraging Behavior, Diet, and Time of Breeding of Florida Scrub-Jays in Suburban and Wildland Habitats
authors: Arthur L. Fleischer, Reed Bowman, Glen E. Woolfenden
year: 2003
species: Florida Scrub-Jay
factor: [[satiation]] & [[Anthropogenic disturbance]]
effect: Well fed individuals and individuals in suburban areas spent more time perched and therefore increased their time spent as sentinel.

Sentinel behavior as one member scanning the sky from an exposed perch and alerts other group members to the presence of predators.

Suburban jays spend most of their increased perching time as sentinel <- [[Anthropogenic disturbance]] 
Wildland jays that were fed peanuts also decreased foragin and increased vigilance <- [[satiation]] 
in line with [[Bednekoff's Model]] of state dependent indivifual decisions.

Suburban jays forage more effiently than wildland jays, therefore can shift time from foraging to vigilance/sentinel behavior and still maintain their food consumption rates.
Increase in vigilance in suburban jays may have been driven by [[predation]] risk than by energy optimization.

Not directly testing sentinel behavior.
