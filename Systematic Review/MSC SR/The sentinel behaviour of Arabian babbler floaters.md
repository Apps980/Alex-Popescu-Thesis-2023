species: Arabian Babbler
factor: [[Rank]], [[Sex]], [[Membership]]
effect: Dominant males sentinel more often and for longer. Floaters, individuals not part of a group, sentinel for less duration, and less frequently than when in a group.

Sentinel behavior defined as one individual perching up in a high position relative to the surroundings and scans for potential threats. Mentions coordination, though floaters cannot coordinate with members of another group.

"An individual was defined in this study as carrying out sentinel activity when it climbed to a high position above the ground (usually on a treetop), stood steady and looked around without foraging until it left its position" at least 30s. Excluded the first two sentinels to account for effects of observer.

Vigilance is carried out over seconds, Sentinel behavior is carried out for several minutes. Vigilance is carried out by multiple individuals in a group, whereas there is usually only one sentinel.

Between 40 and 70% of foraging time is covered by a sentinel.

Floaters are individuals who live alone within the territory of another group, without being a part of it.
Occurs when there is a saturation of dominant individuals.

All floaters acted as sentinels, average 5.3+/-3.1 min.
Upon becoming floaters, dominants reduced their sentinel activity more than subordinates, and males reduced their sentinel activity more than females.

Dominant individuals sentinelled more than subordinates (sentinel duration & frequency) <- [[Rank]]
#Males sentinelled more than females (duration & frequency again) <- [[Sex]]

Dominant and subordinate floaters, as well as floaters of either sex did not have significant differences in sentinel duration or frequency. <- [[Membership]]

All floaters performed sentinel activity, and during sentinel bouts uttered ‘alarm calls’ at the same rate that they did when they were group members.<- selfish reasons for doing so, since they do not 'belong' to the group, and therefore any advantages it provides to the group does not benefit the individual. <- supports [[Bednekoff's Model]] of 'safe' selfish sentinels, yet other motives are possible.
- Detection of foreign conspecifics by floaters

Floaters descreased their sentinel efforts: incentive to increase outweighed by incentive to decrease.
- Potentially due to fear of detection by territory owners
- Foraging effectiveness is lower in foreign territory: less time to be allocated to sentinel behavior.
- Floaters are weaker, and therefore have less energy to dedicate to sentinel efforts <- again, [[Bednekoff's Model]]

Higher incentive for dominants to be sentinel to guard territory against intruders. Also potentially a show of 'ownership' <- [[Rank]]
