title: Experimental field evidence that out-group threats influence within-group behavior
authors: Amy Morris-Drake, Charlotte Christensen, Julie M Kern, Andrew N Radford
year: 2019
species: Dwarf Mongoose
factor:[[Presence of a rival group]]
effect: The presence of a rival group caused individuals to more regularly act as sentinels.


Outgroup threats range from individuals seeking mating opportunities to whole groups attempting to invade the territory or resources of another.

Following territory intrusions, individuals may increase their vigilance and decrease their foraging.

Nasty-neighbour effect: neighbouring groups are more threatening than strangers
Dear-enemy effect: stranger groups are more threatening than neighbouring groups.

No definition for sentinel behavior.

Significantly more sentinel behavior following rival-group playbacks and fecal presentations <- [[Presence of a rival group]] increased the likelihood of sentinels being present.

No effects of sex and rank on individual response to rival groups.

Very likely, increase in sentinel activity from need to gather more information on potential out-group rivals.
Out-group individuals pose a threat to all group members if the former are seeking to take resources, causing an increase in the need to be vigilant for them.
