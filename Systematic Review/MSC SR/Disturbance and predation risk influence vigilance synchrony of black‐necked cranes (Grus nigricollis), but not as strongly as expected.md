title: Disturbance and predation risk influence vigilance synchrony of black‐necked cranes <i>Grus nigricollis</i> , but not as strongly as expected
authors: Dejun Kong, Anders Pape Møller, Yanyun Zhang
year: 2021
species: Black-necked Cranes
factor: [[Presence of young]] [[predation]] [[Anthropogenic disturbance]]
effect: Increased perceived threat, such as the presence of young or anthropogenic disturbances led to a shift towards coordinated vigilance.

Good definitions of vigilance. 
Sentinel behavior as a well-known form of coordinated vigilance, one group member remaining vigilant in order to avoid scan gaps of independent and synchronized vigilance by chance. No mention of elevation.

Hypothesized that cranes would increase synchrony in response to increased disturbance and predation risk and potentially shift to coordinated (sentinel) vigilance.

Adults without juveniles behaved synchronously, while adults in the [[Presence of young]] or in high disturbance areas behaved vigilant in a coordinated pattern <- [[Anthropogenic disturbance]] 

[[Presence of young]] as proxy for [[predation]] risk, since they are more vulnerable, and therefore predation threat is increased, and so is vigilance.

Sentinel behavior as evolutionarily unstable, since coordination is time-costly and sentinels are at greater risk of being depredated. therefore it is only selected for in highly risky situations <- [[predation]]

Adults spent more time being vigilant than juveniles <- [[maturity]]
