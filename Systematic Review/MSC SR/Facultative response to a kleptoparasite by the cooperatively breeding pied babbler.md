title: Facultative response to a kleptoparasite by the cooperatively breeding pied babbler
authors: A. Ridley, N. Raihani
year: 2007
species: Pied Babbler
factor:
effect:
[[Mixed flock]] 

In the absence of drongos, babblers in smaller groups spent more time sentinelling (per individual) than members of larger groups. <- [[Group Size]] 
No difference in proportion of observation time with a sentinel present among small and large groups.

In small groups with drongos, individuals sentineled less than when a drongo was absent.
In larger groups with drongos, individuals sentineled more than when a drongo was absent.
Reliance to drongos decreased as group size increased. Benefits of having drongos likewise decreased as group size increased.
