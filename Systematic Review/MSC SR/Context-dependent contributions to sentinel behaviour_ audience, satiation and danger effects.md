title: Context-dependent contributions to sentinel behaviour: audience, satiation and danger effects
authors: Josh J. Arbon, Julie M. Kern, Amy Morris-Drake, Andrew N. Radford
year: 2020
species: Dwarf Mongoose
factor: [[satiation]] [[predation]] [[Group Size]]
effect: When accompanied, individuals contributed less to sentinel behavior. When satiated or in a high risk environment, sentinel contributions increased.

While individual variations in activity contribution exist, there are also context-driven variations.

Audience effects: individual changes their behavior in response to the presence and identity of others.
[[satiation]] effects: state of the individual, allowing for differential allocation of energetic resources compared to less fed individuals.
Danger effects: increased [[predation]] leads to an increased need of antipredator and vigilance behaviors.

Sentinel behavior as an individual who adopts a raised position to look out for danger while other groupmates continue with other activities such as foraging. Affected by fixed or relatively stable factors such as [[Sex]], [[Rank]], and [[Group Size]].

Dwarf Mongoose can have context-dependent variations in behavior, such as differential responses to alarm calls based on signaller's position (height), receiver's [[satiation]], and prior information about their current predation risk ( less satiated = more risk tolerant)

Theoretically predicted by the risk allocation hypothesis, they expected to observe an interaction between [[satiation]] and [[predation]] levels. As costs and benefits of the foraging/vigilance tradeoff change with both satiation and danger levels, individuals are expected to have maximal vigilance past a critical energetic threshold.

Only used adults older than 1 year.

Likelihood of an individual to perform a sentinel bout was affected by [[satiation]] and [[predation]] but not the interaction. Fed individuals were more likely to sentinel than non-fed individuals.
Time to first sentinel not affected by [[satiation]] or [[predation]]
Increased [[predation]] risk did not affect bout duration, but had a significant effect on number of bouts performed.
[[satiation]] increased both duration and number of bouts.
Scan rate also increased in response to increased perceived [[predation]] risk.
Sentinel investment was affected by audience , [[satiation]] and [[predation]] risk.
audience decreased sentinel investment ( decreased likelihood of initiating sentinel behavior)<- [[Group Size]]
Individuals do not seem to be using sentinel behavior as a way to obtain social prestige or as a display. <- explained by a localized [[Group Size]] 
effect (many eyes or dilution). Personal danger levels lower when foraging with another individual than when foraging alone.

Additional food led to an increased likelihood of an individual performing sentinel behavior, but did not reduce the time until the first sentinel bout. <- supports [[Bednekoff's Model]]

Increased [[predation]] risk level caused an increase in the likelihood of sentinel behavior and number of bouts performed, but not time until first bout or mean bout duration, suggesting the response to increased risk is more frequent bouts as opposed to longer bouts. Ergo, vigilance increases with perceived risk, as theorized by the risk allocation hypothesis.
Perceived [[predation]] risk is also affected by heterospecific alarm calls, and eavesdropping on other species is a good way of collecting more information about the current risk levels. Information is retained and results in increased number of bouts.

One other advantage of sentinel behavior could be scanning for good foraging patches once the sentinel bout is complete. Other advantages include scanning for out-group threats and intruders as well as potential mating opportunities.

Sentinel behavior could be explained through selfish or cooperative benefits!
