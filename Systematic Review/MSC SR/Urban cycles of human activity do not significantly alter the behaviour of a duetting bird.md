title: Urban cycles of human activity do not significantly alter the behaviour of a duetting bird

species:  Rufous Hornero
factor: [[Weekend Effect]]
effect: No effects on the proportion of time spent performing sentinel behavior in either sex.

[[Weekend Effect]] hypothesis predicts that the weekly cycles of human activity affect the physiology and behavior of non-human animals. Higher activity levels result in increased levels of vigilance and fear-related behaviors.
- Less time foraging
- reliance on lower quality areas and higher energetic costs
All in response to increased human disturbance.

Sentinel behavior as an individual perched high on trees or human infrastructures in order to detect territorial intruders and predators. Probably included territorial sentinel activity.

Human activity was higher on weekdays than on weekends, including [[Anthropogenic Noise]] 

No significant differences in the proportion of time either sex spent as sentinel between weekdays and weekends. Results do not support the [[Weekend Effect]] 

Not significant but birds spent slightly more time ~4% as sentinel during high disturbance periods.

Tolerant to human disturbance <- synurbic
or that the "low" levels of distrubance already trigger behavioral changes.
