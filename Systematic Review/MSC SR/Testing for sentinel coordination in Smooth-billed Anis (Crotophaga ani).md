authors: Jing Sheng Hing, Gregory Schmaltz, James S. Quinn

species: Smooth-billed Anis
factor:
effect: Did not test for factors affecting sentinel behavior.

Mentions coordination as defining feature of sentinel behavior.
Sentinel activity known to correlate with satiation and energetic state.
Individuals are more likely to be sentinel and remain so for longer periods of time when satiated or in possession of greater energetic reserves.
Coordination of sentinel behavior bouts may share the costs and benefits of sentinel behavior more evenly.
Smooth-billed ani did not have a coordinated sentinel system.
