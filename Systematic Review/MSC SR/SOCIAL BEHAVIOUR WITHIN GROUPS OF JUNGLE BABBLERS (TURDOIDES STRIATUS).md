Sentinel behavior as one member of a babbler group remaining perched several meters above the groud while the rest of the group feed below.
Sentinel present 82% of the time spent observing the babblers.
Mean duration of sentinel bouts varied with [[Time of Day]]: increased from dawn to mid-afternoon, decreasing again before dusk. Suggests amount of time spent in sentinel activity be determined by the ability of individuals to refrain from feeding: Energetic state, supported by [[Bednekoff's Model]]. Related to an individual's ability to find food efficiently.
The lack of a fixed pattern suggests a flexible response to different situations: context or state dependence.
Breeders performed ~50% of sentinel activity, with the rest being shared by other non-breeding adults<- Dominance [[Rank]]
First-year birds rarely took part<- [[maturity]]
Among non-breeders, males had a tendency to perfrom more sentinel behavior than females<-[[Sex]]
