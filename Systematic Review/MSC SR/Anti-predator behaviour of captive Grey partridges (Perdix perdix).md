Title: Anti-predator behaviour of captive Grey partridges (Perdix perdix)
Authors: L. Beani, F. Dessí-Fulgheri
Year: 1998
Species: Grey Partidge(Perdrix perdrix)
Factor: [[Sex]] [[Pair status]]
Effect: Males are more likely to be alert and make warning calls than females. Unpaired males are more vigilant than paired males.

*“Animals survive only by being vigilant for predators. But how can we tell where an animal is looking and what it is looking for? Vigilance in animals is a frustrating thing to study” (LAZARUS 1990)

*"The most direct evidence of anti-predator strategy is that the indivual becomes more vigilant (freeze, escape and so on) when the risk of predation incresases."" (LAZARUS 1990)

Males were more frequently in the alert posture than females. More likely to make warning calls. 

As the number of days increased since the pairing date ("dating") the mean vigilance score decreased -> Males with higher vigilance are attractive, but being so vigilant is costly = decrease when pair bond is made
Formed pair bonds sooner than less vigilant males.
Unpaired males suffered higher mortality: more vulnerable to raptor predation.
Sentinel activity as [[sexual display]]. [[Pair status]] (paired/unpaired) affects vigilance and sentinel behavior. Unpaired males are more vigilant.

Uses mean score as data. Yet could be useful.
Coordination is not mentioned
