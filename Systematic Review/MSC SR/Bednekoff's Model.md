- Dominance
- Satiation
- Body Size

The effect of supplemental feedings in Dwarf Mongoose resulted in an increase in the frequency and duration of bouts of sentinel behavior, but did not reduce the time until the first sentinel bout. [[Context-dependent contributions to sentinel behaviour_ audience, satiation and danger effects]]

Supplemental feedings result in the individual's energetic reserves being higher, and therefore closer to the energetic threshold past which sentinel behavior becomes favorable to the individual. This could also explain the difference in sentinel contribution found between dominant and subordinate individuals. These subordinate individuals are non-breeding 'helpers' who vary in age, sexual maturity, size and sex.
