title: Does sex affect both individual and collective vigilance in social mammalian herbivores: the case of the eastern grey kangaroo?
authors: Olivier Pays, Peter J. Jarman

species: Eastern Grey Kangaroo
factor:
effect:

Two hypotheses to explain the difference in individual vigilance between sexes:
- The first hypothesis, related to intra-specific competition, suggests that, in gregarious species, direct competition between males (e.g. for territoriality or for access to females) requires them to spend time scanning to assess rivalsâ€™ presence and activities <- [[Intrasexual competition]] 
- The second hypothesis suggests that the body size difference between the sexes in sexually dimorphic species (as are most medium and large herbivorous mammal species) predicts different absolute energy requirements. <- Kinda [[Bednekoff's Model]]
- body-size dimorphism and also of responsibility for the safety of dependent young <- [[Bednekoff's Model]] + [[parental care]]

Mentions #Coordination  as assumption for collective vigilance

[[Collective vigilance]] instead of sentinel behavior. Sentinel behavior is a form of collective vigilance, but the opposite is not true (square rectangle). 

No effects of group size on bout duration or frequency of bouts. [[Group Size]] did decrease the duration of inter-scan bouts, leading to an increase in the proportion of time at least one individual is vigilant. 
No effects of group composition  (mixed sex, female only)
Female kangaroos spent a higher proportion of time vigilant than a male, not because of higher frequency of scans, but because of longer vigilance bouts. <- [[Sex]] 

Eastern grey kangaroo have pronounced sexual body-size dimorphism, compatible with the body-size-dimorphism hypothesis: Greater [[Body Mass]] = greater need to forage
Alternatively, larger individuals forage more effectively.

Another alternative is that females are more vulnerable to [[predation]] and therefore require greater vigilance. Males are taller, and therefore can detect predators sooner: less need for frequent scans. Likewise, males can defend themselves.

Kangaroos had a tendency to synchronize their bouts of vigilance, not supporting individual, independent scanning.
