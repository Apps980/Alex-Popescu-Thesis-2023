title: Intrapopulation variation in the behavioral responses of dwarf mongooses to anthropogenic noise
authors: Emma Eastcott, Julie M Kern, Amy Morris-Drake, Andrew N Radford
year: 2020
species: Dwarf Mongoose
factor: [[Anthropogenic Noise]] [[Rank]]
effect: Anthropogenic noise had a positive effect on sentinel efforts of all individuals, with increased sentinel bout duration. More dominant individual sentineled more than subordinates.

[[Anthropogenic Noise]], a form of [[Anthropogenic disturbance]] disrupts individuals by:
- Masking or partially masking relevant acoustic cues and signals in a way that accurate information is not received
- Causing individuals to mistakenly respond to a cue, resulting in increased fitness costs
- Distracting individuals and thereby reducing performance in a behavior
- Act as a stressor and cause a cascade of physiological and behavioral changes

Anthropogenic noise can disrupt the foraging-vigilance tradeoff, causing a shift towards increased vigilance, potentially at a detrimental cost.

When subjected to [[Anthropogenic Noise]] foragers rely less on the sentinel and increase their personal vigilance. Increased noise can therefore decrease the quality of acoustic cues given by the sentinel.

Increased likelihood of an individual to become sentinel when subjected to [[Anthropogenic Noise]]. Not affected by age, rank, or sex.

[[Anthropogenic Noise]] increased bout duration when compared to ambient control.

Dominant individuals sentineled for longer than subordinates, but no interaction with [[Anthropogenic Noise]] or effects of sex<- [[Rank]] 

Sentinel position moved more frequently when subjected to [[Anthropogenic Noise]] 

Unnecessary escape, vigilance and sentinel behaviors are energetically expensive due to lost-opportunity costs and costs of movement.
Greater sentinel activity in the presence of [[Anthropogenic Noise]] could reflect a heightened risk when acoustic information is compromised. <- [[predation]] 
[[Anthropogenic Noise]] can also be a significant source of stress, causing the individuals to make maladaptive decisions in the foraging-vigilance tradeoff.
