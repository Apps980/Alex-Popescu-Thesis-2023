title: On the self-regulation of sentinel activity among Arabian babbler groupmates
authors: Roni Ostreiher, Roger Mundry, Aviad Heifetz
year: 2021
species: Arabian Babbler
factor: [[Sex]] & [[Rank]], [[satiation]]
effect:Increased duration and frequency of sentinel behavior. Satiation caused individuals to perform sentinel behavior.

State-variable game theoretic model, symmetric across all group members, in which individuals trade the need to forage agains the advantages of earlier risk detection when sentinelling.
The decision to start and stop sentinel behavior is dependent on the energetic levels of the individual, AS WELL AS whether some other individual is already acting as a sentinel. <- [[satiation]]

If an individual is satiated, they will sentinel regardless of whether another sentinel is on guard.

"a sentinel that started off fully satiated will terminate its sentinel bout earlier when its energy level drops below a threshold that is higher than the depletion threshold below which hunger would incentivize it to forage"

Subordinates invest more time in foraging than dominant individuals.

Sentinel behavior is carried out by all individuals over 4 months old, and occurs for about 50% of the day. (Ostreiher & Heifetz, 2019)

Dominants and adult males act as sentinels more frequently and for longer than subordinates and adult females.

A sentinel is an individual that stays on treetop for more than 60s.

During the 1080h recorded, a sentinel was present for 51.3% of the time.
- 1 sentinel: 85.8% of time
- 2 sentinels: 10.6% of time
- >2 sentinels: 3.6%

Number of sentinel bouts and total duration were significantly affected by [[Sex]] and [[Rank]] and their interaction: males > females for the same rank, and higher rank = more sentinel.

Bouts terminated by another individual on guard were shorter than bouts terminated in the absence of another individual.

Irrespective of the sentinel, a satiated individual will become a sentinel. <- supports equilibrium prediction of Bednekoff's model.
34% of time, the satiated individual performed social or personal activities, not included in the model.

Group member's competitive foraging abilities are not equal and should be added into [[Bednekoff's Model]] <- originally assumes symmetry across group members.

No coordination of sentinel behavior: individual maximization of foraging-sentinelling tradeoff.
