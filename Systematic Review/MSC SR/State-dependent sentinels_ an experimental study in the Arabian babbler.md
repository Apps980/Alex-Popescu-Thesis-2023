effect:

Sentinel behavior as group members taking turns (coordination) to be vigilant in a position with great visibility. These individuals scan the surrounding areas and make alarm calls when threats are sighted.

[[Bednekoff's Model]] is the most parsimonious explanation for a stable system behind sentinel behavior.
- Based upon group member's individual selfish needs and states
- Assumes sentinel behavior is relatively safe when compared to foraging without one.
- Assumes sentinel behavior is low cost.
It is inferred that if one individual has increased ability to perform sentinel behavior, then others will decrease theirs.
[[Bednekoff's Model]] functions irrespective of relatedness, dominance, or past performance as a sentinel.
Total sentinel effort is expected to increase in larger groups or in the presence of more food opportunities / increased foraging success.

Body mass as measurement.

More dominant males acted as sentinel more frequently than the rest of the group (unfed, control). <- Sex and [[Rank]], but not exactly

Feeding individuals increased their sentinel effort, decreased sentinel effort in other group members <-  [[satiation]] & [[compensation]]

When feeding subordinates, the subordinate individual increased their sentinel effort, and led to a decrease in sentinel efforts in non-fed individuals, irrespective of rank and sex.
Compensation was similar among rank and sex, suggesting no effects of sex or rank on compensation.

Supplemental feeding resulted in increased sentinel effort overall
Significant differences in body mass were detected among types of group members: higher rank = more body mass

If more food = increased [[Body Mass]] = increased sentinel behavior holds true, the [[Bednekoff's Model]] is supported, and sentinel behavior is state-dependent. Also explains the lack of cheating.

Compensation was not complete: total group sentinel effort increased during supplemental satiation.

There was no competition between individuals of the same sex and similar rank for sentinel positions, suggesting that the social prestige or sexual display explanation for sentinel behavior is unlikely in the species.

Even when given supplemental feedings, subordinates did not increase their body mass, suggesting a balance between the advantages of increased mass and the costs of carrying that mass around.

Dominant individuals require more mass to maintain their position (only high-quality individuals become dominant)

Does not appear to have any value as a social function, or to gather social  prestige, since all individuals perform sentinel behavior to some extent.
