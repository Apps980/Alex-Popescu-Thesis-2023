title: The "Predator Early Warning System" of Red-Winged Blackbirds (Sistema de Alarma Temprana Contra Depredadores por Parte de Agelaius phoeniceus)

species: Red-winged Blackbirds
factor:
effect:

Males use prominent perches within their territories and have an "alarm system" of calls with which they can signal the presence of nest predators <- I guess definition for sentinel, no mention of coordination.

When a sentinel male is not present, the female spends time in anti-predator vigilance at the expense of incubating or brooding.

No effects on sentinel tested, only tested the response of females to the presence of a male sentinel. [[Sex]] appears to be a principal factor, and sentinel behavior could be a part of male [[sexual display]].

#Males spend considerable amounts of time scanning from perches (sentinel). Did not test the amount of time, nor how much time was spent there. Could be territory defense, could be nest defense. Depends of [[Breeding Period]].
