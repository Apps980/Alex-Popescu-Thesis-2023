title: Sentinels in Saltator atricollis (Passeriformes: Emberizidae)
authors: J. Ragusa-Netto
year: 2001
species: Black-throated Saltator
factor: [[Group Size]] 
effect: No Effects on time with a sentinel

No coordination mentionned. Definition used is "individuals that interrupt foraging for extended periods to watch for predators"

Sentinels improve the group's vigilance and therefore reduce the personal efforts of vigilance in other group members. <- (McGowan & Woolfenden, 1989; Hailman et al., 1994)

All alarm calls given were made by the prominently perched bird. Also made frequent [[contact calls]].

Group size had no effect on the time birds were on exposed perches. (Group size had no effect on the likelihood of there being a sentinel present.) <- (Ferguson, 1987; Hailman et al., 1994)

Predator avoidance is thought as the main function of sentinel behavior. Prominent perches not used as vantage point for foraging.
