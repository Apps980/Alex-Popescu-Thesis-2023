title: Florida Scrub-Jays ( <i>Aphelocoma coerulescens</i> ) are Sentinels More When Well-Fed (Even with no Kin Nearby): Sentinel Behavior by Florida Scrub-Jays Fed Peanuts
authors: Peter A. Bednekoff, Glen E. Woolfenden
year: 2003
species: Florida Scrub-Jay
factor: [[satiation]]
effect: Satiated individuals performed sentinel efforts more often than hungry ones.

Sentinels defined as members of animal groups that watch from prominent, exposed positions while other members are engaged in other activities (usually feeding). Shows coordination (defining feature)

Taxonomic patterns of occurance suggests that sentinel behavior had multiple, independent origins, probably when several widespread ecological factors combine in some particular way. Sentinel behavior appears in small, stable groups in scrub habitats that face intense predation pressures.

Sentinels have a large advantage in detecting predators, and they lower their predation risk by taking up such an exposed position.
Assuming sentinels are safe, then sentinel behavior can be understood as a foraging-predation risk tradeoff (Lima)

All group members act as sentinels to some degree, but adult males are more likely to be sentinels. <- [[maturity]]

When fed, individuals reduced their foraging time, and increased their sentinel time. If no need to feed, then sentinel behavior is the most beneficial activity for the individual. <- [[satiation]]

Data is change in amount of time.

Effects of sex, dominance and other factors might be confusing, since these factors also affect foraging, and therefore the energetic reserves of individuals.

When removing the effects of body weight, [[Sex]] still caused an effect on sentinel behavior.

Kin selection, social prestige and reciprocity are not supported explanations for sentinel behavior. Sentinel safety best explains sentinel behavior, supporting a selfish, state-dependent explanation for sentinel behavior, such as [[Bednekoff's Model]]

Mutual advantage, or by-product mutualism can also help explain this. By providing safety to the group, you are maintaining group size and, therefore, its benefits.

Sentinel interchanges seem to occur largely as opportunistic reactions to current state(s) and the actions of other jays in the group: if satiated, then sentinel. If no sentinel present but energetic levels above minimal threshold, then sentinel. Else, not sentinel.

REMEMBER: Sentinels are relatively safe when compared to foraging without a sentinel, and sentinels have greater visibility.
