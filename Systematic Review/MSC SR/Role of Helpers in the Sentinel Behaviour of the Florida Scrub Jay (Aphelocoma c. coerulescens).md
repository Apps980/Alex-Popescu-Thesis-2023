title: Role of Helpers in the Sentinel Behaviour of the Florida Scrub Jay (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens)
authors: Jack P. Hailman, Kevin J. McGowan, Glen E. Woolfenden
year: 2010
species: Florida Scrub-Jay
factor:[[Sex]] & [[maturity]], [[Group Size]]
effect: Older individuals performed more sentinel efforts than younger ones. Males tended to be sentinels more often than females, yet this was inconsistent. Larger groups led to decreases in individual sentinel efforts.

Sentinel coordination mentioned: one jay perches watchfully at a vantage point while the other group members forage nearby. Sentinels identified as individuals who look at the ground for less than ~50% of time, scanning every 20s and perched for longer than 30s.

Scrub-jays are permanently paired, but can have helpers. Frequently related (previous offspring) but relationships can vary greatly.

Helpers decrease mortality and increase nesting success. Potentially due to predation, primarily by raptors.

All group members participated in sentinel behavior to some degree, but total contributions varied with status. (Age and Sex)

Male and female breeders do not contribute differently, but male breeders spend more time than younger individuals.

Differed throughout time: Peak in winter and smaller peak in summer.

Male breeders spent more time than older helpers (irrespective of sex). Female breeders were intermediate.

During the summer months, male breeders spent more time than females or helpers of either sex. 
Yearling female helpers spent significantly less time than female breeders or male helpers <- [[Sex]] & [[maturity]] 

Spikes in sentinel behavior coincided with increases in raptor populations.

Female helpers tended to spend more time on sentinel duty than male helpers of the same age.

The presence of helpers significantly decreased sentinel efforts in breeding males.

in late summer, there was a significant negative correlation between male and female breeder's sentinel efforts and [[Group Size]] <- increases in group size cause decreases in individual sentinel efforts.

Bouts of sentinel duty were of random length.

the length of a sentinel bout is random in the sense that a jay has a constant probability of ending sentinel duty regardless of how long it has already been engaged

Helpers participate in sentinel duty, but perform fewer bouts than breeders.

Alle birds in a group, including the helpers, participate in sentinel behavior and do so nearly equally.

Still stronger evidence supports a tendency for male breeders to participate more than helpers of either sex, but female breeders and helpers have no consistent difference in participation among groups.

Helpers significantly decrease the time spent being sentinel in breeders. Effects best seen in females.

The sentinel efforts of helpers did not completely account for the decrease in sentinel efforts from the breeders: helpers decreased the total sentinel time.

The participation by male helpers was usually absolutely greater than that by female helpers of the same age class, although the difference was rarely significant.

There were behavioral changes caused by nesting period: Female helpers sentinelled more often due to a drive to cover the nest. Since the breeding female already occupied this role, the female helpers would loiter around the nest, performing sentinel duties. The males would spend their time gathering food. <- Division of labour.

Younger individuals are more likely to make false alarms: not trusted by older individuals. <- less mature = less sentinel.

As group size increases, the 'many eyes' hypothesis might explain the decrease in sentinel efforts. Yet, total sentinel coverage is higher with helpers than without.
