Two main necessities in life: to eat and to not be eaten

Sentinel behavior as one individual interrupting foraging behavior to climb up to a high and prominent position to scan the surrounding areas.
Coordination has been defined as the defining feature of sentinel behavior.

A sentinel might be safer because it can better detect predators.
"Selfish" sentinel if one sentinel has a fitness advantage in a population of nonsentinels.

Ideally, individuals should switch between fitness-enhancing activities, depedning on it energetic state.
If low, then forage. If high then sentinel.

Trade-off between foraging and sentinel may differ between dominant and subordinate individuals.
Dominant individuals could be more efficient foragers (stealing)

Model proporsed by McNamara and Houston pertain to the time allocation of more or less efficient foragers between risky patch with food, and safe patch with no food, and to the resulting energetic levels of the foragers.
Dominant individuals are more efficient foragers, and the safer no-food patch is the sentinel position.

Dominants act as sentinel more than subordinates in many taxa.

Sentinel as climbed up in a tree and scanned for longer than 60s.

The average duration of sentinel bouts were longer when individuals received supplemental feeding. When fed, dominant and subordinate adults sentinelled equally (duration)<- [[satiation]]
Unfed, males sentineled longer than females <- [[Sex]] 
Unfed, dominant individuals sentineled longer than subordinates. <- [[Rank]]
In response to being fed, subordinates increased their sentinel duration more than dominant individuals. Explained by dominants already having longer bouts.

In response to feeding, gaps between two sentinel bouts performed by the same individual decreased. Very drastic. Gap shorter for dominant.
Subordinates ate more than dominants, suggesting that they end their sentinel bouts at lower energetic levels.

When fed, individuals wen to sentinel immediately after 62% of the time.

According to McNamara's model, more efficient foragers will reach critical energetic levels to perform sentinel behavior in less time.

Model not fully supported by results. Supports [[Bednekoff's Model]] 

Sentinel activity is impeded by different factors: hunger, self well‐being behaviors (such as resting and autopreening), mutual physical interactions (such as allopreening, play and antagonist interactions with group mates), breeding activities, and presence of another sentinel.
Enhanced by danger, presence of foreign individuals and the need to acquire information.
