title: Florida Scrub-Jays Compensate for the Sentinel Behavior of Flockmates
authors: Peter A. Bednekoff, Glen E. Woolfenden
year: 2006
species: Florida Scrub-Jay
factor: Mate [[satiation]] - Compensation, [[Sex]], Date since group establishment.
effect: Individuals sentinelled less when mates were fed. Males in newly established groups sentinelled less.

Mentions coordination! <- as defining feature of sentinel systems. Sentinels come and go, but the number of sentinels varies little. May be highly coordinated without being tightly organized at the group level.

Definition for sentinel behavior: Coordinated vigilance, usually from high, exposed positions.

Sentinel behavior only occurs in some species. Multiple independent origins and probably when several widespread ecological factors combine in some particular way. 

Well-fed individuals act as sentinels (Bedneckoff)<- [[satiation]]

Compensation is when one decreases their sentinel behavior when another increases theirs. Generally, it is undercompensation: the decrease in one does not match the increase in the other.

Adult males are most likely to be sentinel <- [[Sex]]  & [[maturity]] 
Although all group members act as sentinels to some degree.

13 pairs: No offspring. One mate received food/no food as treatment, the other never received food. Peanuts.
Foraging/sentinel/other as behaviors.
Supplemental feeding expected to reduce foraging and increase sentinel. Indirectly causing the other to increase foraging and decrease sentinel <- [[compensation]]

Mate feeding caused decrease in sentinel behavior and increase in foraging.

Males in newly established groups sentinelled less than males in established groups.

Not supported by hypothesis of sentinel as sexual display or social prestige-seeking behavior.
Sentinel behavior as mutual advantage.

Sentinel behavior declines as the breeding season approaches (?)
