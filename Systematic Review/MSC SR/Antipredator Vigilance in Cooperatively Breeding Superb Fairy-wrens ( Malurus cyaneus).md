title: Antipredator Vigilance in Cooperatively Breeding Superb Fairy-wrens ( <i>Malurus cyaneus</i> )
authors: Ken Yasukawa, Andrew Cockburn
year: 2009
species: Superb Fairy-wrens
factor: [[Group Size]] [[Rank]] [[Presence of young]] 
effect: Increased group size led to increased total time with sentinel, yet dominant males with helpers sentineled more than dominant males in pairs (no helpers). [[Breeding Period]] and the [[Presence of young]] also increased sentinel efforts, suggesting sentinel behavior is an extension of parental care.

Sentinel behavior as an individual who scans for predators to guard other group members and alert them to danger, and which take turn on guard. Coordination is mentioned.

Tested to determine if sentinel behavior is a form of parental care. Assumptions:
- All male individuals act as sentinels
- Antipredator vigilance is associated with presence of nestlings
- Total amount of vigilance increases with group size
- The presence of helpers decreases time spent by individuals acting sentinel compared to pairs without sentinels
- Greater sentinel efforts result in increased fledgeling success
- Presence of a sentinel facilitates feeding by other provisioners (females, helpers)
- Probability of ending a sentinel bout is independent of length and is coordinated to provide efficient coverage.

All males, breeding and helpers, contributed to sentinel efforts, yet no differences between amount of time as sentinel between pair males without helpers, dominants with helpers or helpers.

When nestlings were present, males spent more time as sentinels than when nests contained eggs only. <- [[Presence of young]]

[[Group Size]] led to an increase in time as sentinel.
Breeding males spent more time as sentinel than pair males without helpers. <- [[Group Size]]

Increased guarding did not result in increased fledgling success.

Bout length and interbout length were random. 
No evidence that sentinel behavior wa coordinated.

Evidence supports the hypothesis that sentinel behavior is an extension of [[parental care]]. 

All breeding males spent at least some time scanning near active nests, with total sentinel time increasing with [[Group Size]], and sentinel behavior facilitating the feeding of nestlings.

Partial support for coordination, and none for increased nest success.

[[Rank]] caused an increase in sentinel time in dominant males. The presence of helpers increased their time as sentinels when compared to groups without helpers. This could be by reducing the dominant male's contribution to nest feeding in exchange for increased sentinel efforts (and potentially quality).

Sentinels near nests could make nest discovery by predators less likely.

[[Breeding Period]] appears to have an effect, as sentinels may be less risk tolerant towards nest predation.
