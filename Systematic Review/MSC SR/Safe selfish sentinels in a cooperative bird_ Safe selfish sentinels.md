year: 2001
species: Arabian Babbler
factor: [[Body Mass]] [[Group Size]]
effect: Sentinel efforts increased with body mass. Increased group size caused a decrease in individual sentinel efforts.

Many hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms: reciprocity, kin relatedness, individual benefits.

[[Bednekoff's Model]] is a system of stable cooperative sentinel behavior based on selfish individual state-dependent decisions.
Based on Lima's foraging-vigilance tradeoff.
Assumptions of [[Bednekoff's Model]]:
	- Sentinel behavior is a low-cost activity performed by individuals that have sufficient energetic reserves from foraging.
	- Benefits of sentinel behavior arise only from an increase in personal safety, not from protecting other group members
	- Safe refuges do not exist, therefore the sentinel's post is the safest place to be if the alternative is foraging without a sentinel

Believed that larger groups will provide overall better protection to all members, while also decreasing each individual's contribution to sentinel behaviors. <- Seen in meerkats: larger groups = less individual sentinel duty

Relative safety and effectiveness of sentinels depends on visibility

Sentinel behavior defined as a single group member perched in a prominent and elevated location with its head up, looking around and being vigilant.

Sentinel effort per bird was significantly greater in males than females ([[Sex]]), and increased significantly with [[Rank]]

As [[Group Size]] increased, so did the total number of seconds with at least one sentinel present. Caused a decrease in sentinel effort per per per hour.

Sentinel effort nearly doubled in the mid-winter months compared to the midsummer months. <- explained by more food available, and less foraging time lost to midday heat

Overlap between simultaneous sentinels is relatively rare.

Body mass increased with sex and dominance. Therefore more mass = more sentinel efforts.

Variations in sentinel behavior, both between and within individuals, was best explained by differences in body mass. Assuming these translate to fat (energy) reserves, this support's [[Bednekoff's Model]] of state-dependent sentinel behavior.

Sentinel efforts did not increase in response to increased [[predation]], potentially due to the babblers learning that migrant raptors are not actively hunting. Still responded to resident species. Possible they can increase sentinel efforts if non-migrant predation increases.

The larger the group, the greater number of individuals with enough energy to be sentinels. Therefore there is greater total sentinel coverage in larger groups.

Sentinels were used when foraging groups were in more open habitats with clear lines of sight <- [[visibility]]


Sex differences could be the result of dominant males monitoring and calling to neighbouring groups <- [[contact calls]]

"Different divisions of sentinel effort in different species may reflect contrasting benefits experienced by each type of group member, as well as alternative time and energy budgets for different group members"
