species: Meerkats
factor: [[Sex]] [[Rank]] [[maturity]] [[Maternal Effect]] [[Group Size]]
effect: As in previous studies, dominant males sentinel for longer than any other individuals, with males sentineling more than females, and dominant males sentineling more than subordinate males. Genetic additive effects drove variations in cooperative behaviors, including sentinel behavior, with maternal effects of [[Body Mass]] on sentinel time. Increased group size led to decreases in individual sentinel contributions.

In cooperatively breeding species, some individuals forgo breeding in favor of helping breeding pairs with their offspring. Such individuals are called "Helpers".
Why helpers exist is a very good questions. Traditional theory of natural selection is based on competition between individuals; helping should not be evolutionarily stable.

Contributions of helpers to cooperative activities are conditional on the sex, age, weight, condition and recent foraging success of helpers <- again, supported by [[Bednekoff's Model]]
Social modifiers to individual contributions include group size, age/sex composition of the group and the ratio of helpers to depedent juveniles.
Yet, there exists individual variation not explained by the usual modifiers.

All group members contribute to a range of cooperative behaviors. Includes non-breeding and breeding individuals.

Sentinel behavior as a behavior that occurs during foraging trips, where an individual ceases foraging, adopts an elevated position to scan the area and make calls to group members if it detects a predator.

Individual contributions to sentinel behavior vary with factors such as age, sex and weight. Not related to relatedness of pups or of group members.

Time spent on sentinel behavior increases rapidly during the first year of life and moderately over the second year, decreasing thereafter <- [[maturity]]
Males spend more time on sentinel behavior than females <- [[Sex]]
Interaction between [[Sex]] and dominance [[Rank]]: Dominant females sentinel less than subordinate females, while dominant males sentinel more than subordinales males.
Individuals in larger groups spend less time on sentinel behavior than individuals in smaller groups.<- [[Group Size]]
[[Maternal Effect]] of [[Body Mass]] on time spent on sentinel behavior.
Across age categories, genetic variances are similar and positively correlated.
Additive genetic variance in sentinel behavior, necessary for any response to selection.
Variation caused by [[Sex]] in sentinel contribution (males more) may occur because of the male role to chase off intruders and acquisition of information on neighbouring groups.
[[Shared Litter]] effects was a significant source of variation for all cooperative behaviors. 
Heritability of cooperative behaviors are particularly low and frequently non-significant.
