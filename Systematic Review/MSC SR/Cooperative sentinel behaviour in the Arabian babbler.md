species: Arabian Babbler
factor: [[Rank]] [[Sex]] [[Body Mass]]
effect: All individuals contributed to sentinel behavior, but sentinel behavior was positively related to dominance rank and sex of the individual. Could be explained by increased body mass, and therefore energetic levels, as theorized by Bednekoff's model.

No mention of coordination, but definition does mention sentinels standing guard in a prominent position.

Cooperative behavior can be stable when based solely upon short-term individually selfish decisions based on each group-member's internal state.

Social prestige as driver for sentinel behavior. Selfishly showing off to gain access to advantageous collaborations and reproductive opportunities.
In exchange for missed foraging opportunities and greater predation risk.

Sentinel behavior positively related with dominance [[Rank]] within each [[Sex]], with males > females of the same rank.
Could be explained via [[Body Mass]]: Mass up = Dominance up = Sentinel up

All birds in all groups appeared to act as sentinels using similar types of location: as high as possible but not super exposed.

Tendency for more dominant individuals to sentinel at greater distances from the group (longer time?)

Sentinels positioned themselves to maximize predator detection while being as close as possible to the foraging group.

Sentinel switches often were caused by the sentinel coming down.

Dominant males were more likely to terminate the sentinel bouts of dominant females.

No evidence of competitive sentinel behavior.

Sentinel behavior explained as a simple state-dependent model. <- [[Bednekoff's Model]]

Assumption that sentinel behavior is a relatively safe behavior when compared to foraging without a sentinel.

Sentinel (dominant) individuals using the behavior to accomplish a social role: communicating with other groups. <-[[contact calls]]
