Generally, it is the male that adopts a perched, defensive position near the nest to guard against predators (sentinel) <- [[Sex]]
This suggests the female is vulnerable while brooding and that both adults are necessary for nest defense.

Guarding in the pre-laying stage may be intended to deter extra-pair copulation and ensure paternity, or for (territory/nest) defense.

Intrusion indirectly affects reproductive success by inflicting additonal stresses onto the breeders (injury, lost opportunity, territory defense, etc) 

Nest-guarding efforts varied with nesting stage [[Breeding Period]] 
13.7% during pre-laying, 6.8% during incubation, 21.9% nestling
