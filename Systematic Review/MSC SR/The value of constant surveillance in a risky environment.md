Antipredator vigilance reduces foraging success, but failure to detect a predator is lethal. Solution is to concentrate vigilance during times of highest risk, but this requires continuously updated information on predation risk (cost intensive).

"Public" (or social) information is abundant (look at others and do the same) but the information is often inaccurate, irrelevant or actively deceptive, so responding to these all the time is costly (lost-opportunity cost). Therefore individuals must balance the cost of ignoring genuine information against the cost of inappropriate responses. Balance shifts with information on predation risk.

Sentinels defined as individuals who stop foraging, perch at least 1m off ground and actively scanning for predators. No mention of coordination. 

Did not test any effects on sentinels, but on foragers. Good paper for my thesis though #Thesis
