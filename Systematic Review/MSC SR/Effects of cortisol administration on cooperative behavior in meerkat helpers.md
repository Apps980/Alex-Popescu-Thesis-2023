"Although the ultimate causes underlying this variation are increasingly well understood and have been shown to be associated with factors such as sex, age, condition, and relatedness to offspring"

In response to stress, thehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activates, producing cortisol. Stress = cortisol
Could be underlying mechanism for individual variation in cooperative contributions.

Meerkat males who were frequenly on sentinel duty had higher glucocortisol levels than those more infrequently on sentinel duty.

Sentinel behavior as an individual who ceases foraging to scan for predators from an elevated position and to alert the group when detecting a predator.

[[Cortisol]] had no effect on the number of times an individual went on sentinel duty in either sex.

While not statistically significant, males were more likely to perform sentinel behavior when injected with cortisol.
