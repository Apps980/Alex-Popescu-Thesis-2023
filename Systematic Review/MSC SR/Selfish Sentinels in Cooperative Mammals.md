title: Selfish Sentinels in Cooperative Mammals

year: 1999
species: Meerkats
factor: [[Group Size]][[satiation]][[Body Mass]][[predation]] 
effect: Individual contribution increased in smaller groups. Fed and heavier individuals contributed more than unfed, lower mass individuals. Areas of high predation had increased sentinel efforts.

Guarding might be the individuals optimal activity once it has sufficient energy and if there is no sentinel on guard. <- assumption of Bednekoff's model: being sentinel is relatively safer than foraging without a sentinel.
Some mention of coordination, but not as defining feature.

Sentinel behavior as an individual who spends prolonged periods watching from raised position, during which the individual is unable to feed. First individual to detect predators, implying they have increased ability to detect threats.

Being sentinel provides direct benefits to individuals when they are near satiation. 
If guard already present, then resting may be optimal<- safe no-food patch
Due to how the meerkats forage, vigilance is ineffective while doing so (burrowing)
Guard present 55.6% of time.
Guards did not suffer increased predation. Potentially safer since they were also located closer to refuge than foragers.<-  first to safety when threats detected.
In lower predation environments, meerkats had sentinels 12% of foraging time <- [[predation]] increased the need for a guard.
Smaller groups had less time with a sentinel than larger groups, yet individuals in smaller groups increased their proportion of time spent guarding/vigilant and sentinelling.<- [[Group Size]]
Individuals in smaller groups increased their individual vigilance efforts while foraging <- [[Group Size]]
Mortality and group size were negatively correlated: group size down = mortality up
All adults contributed to sentinel behavior, but some more than others:
dominant females guarded less.
All else similar, including immigrants from other groups.
Individuals with less [[Body Mass]], typically from babysitting pups the previous day, sentinelled less. Suggesting sentinel contributions are linked with energetic states.
Supplemental feeding increased sentinel contribution (+30%) and spend more time in long sentinel bouts<- [[satiation]]
Fed individuals went on sentinel duty three times more than unfed individuals. <- [[satiation]]
Fed individuals had greater body mass than unfed individuals. Paired with increased sentinel contribution, it would support he hypothesis that sentinel is a state-driven activity.
Probability of an individual to go on guard was nearly doubled when there was no sentinel present. When two individuals were guarding, the one would stop (the one who was there first)

Results from these experiments support [[Bednekoff's Model]] 's predictions and assumptions 

No indication of guard alternation being more complex than the independent optimization of activity by individuals.

No effect of sex.
Learning could play an important role in the development of sentinel behavior. Not genetics.
