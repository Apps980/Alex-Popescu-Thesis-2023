[[Review]]
Displaying males could be acting as sentinels for incubating females.
Could also be acting as decoys, attracting predators away from nest sites.

[[Sex]] seems to be a principal factor involved here, but no tests were performed. Lek behavior in birds is consistent with the sentinel/decoy model.
