authors: Julie M. Kern, Andrew N. Radford
year: 2018
species: Dwarf Mongoose
factor: No effect on sentinel behavior tested.

Sentinel behavior as a system of coordinated guarding, where individuals adopt raised positions to look out for predators.
Individuals that contributed mroe to sentinel behavior received increased grooming (number of grooming bouts, not length) 

Grooming might be a reward for sentinel contributions.
