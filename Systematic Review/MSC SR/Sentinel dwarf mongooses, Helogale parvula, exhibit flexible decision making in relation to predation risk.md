title: Sentinel dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, exhibit flexible decision making in relation to predation risk
authors: Julie M. Kern, Andrew N. Radford
year: 2014
species: Dwarf Mongoose
factor: [[visibility]] [[Group Activity]] [[predation]] 
effect: When travelling in groups, sentinels reduced the duration of their bouts. When perceived predation risk was high, sentinel duration increased, while decreased visibility caused a decrease in bout length.

Decision making in relation to predation risk can potentially be affected by ecological, social and individual variables.
- Ecological: environment type, heterogeneity and quality as well as wind speed
- Social: group size, composition and presence of young. Spatial position, activity and vigilance behavior of group members.
- Individual: Age, sex, body condition, experience and personality.
Sentinel behavior as individual that adopts a raised position to scan the surroundings and provide information about potential threats to group mates engaged in other activities.
This causes increased foraging success and reduced predation risk for foragers.
Sentinel behavior known to be affected by age, sex, dominance rank and nutritional status.
Increased perception of risk caused a general increase in sentinel behavior.

Following an alarm call, individuals were significantly more likely to become a sentinel than following a control call. <- [[predation]]

Sentinels chose higher positions in dense or medium habitats compared to open areas, suggesting visibility affects sentinel position.

Sentinels were on guard for longer after an alarm call was given  during the bout and if there was another sentinel present <- [[predation]] and [[Presence of a Sentinel]] 

Sentinel bout duration decreased for certain activities such as travelling, compared to baby-sitting or foraging
Sentinel bout duration also increased with increased [[visibility]]
Risk allocation hypothesis suggests vigilance should increase in response to increased [[predation]] risk, supported by results.
Adults guarded longer than yearlings <- [[maturity]]

Ecological and social factors can also alter sentinel behavior, during the start (likelihood) and during (duration) of the behavior.

Habitat type is likely to influence [[predation]] risk because predators are more difficult to spot in denser habitats.

Bout duration is affected by [[visibility]] and [[Group Activity]].
