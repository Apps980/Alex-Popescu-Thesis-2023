title: Meerkat helpers increase sentinel behaviour and bipedal vigilance in the presence of pups
authors: Peter Santema, Tim Clutton-Brock
year: 2013
species: Meerkats
factor: [[Presence of young]]
effect:Presence of young foragers increased sentinel efforts of both male and female helpers. Could be linked to increased [[predation]] and not simply their presence. Suggests sentinel behavior as a cooperative, not selfish, behavior.

Sentinel behavior benefits group members by both decreasing risk of predation and increasing foraging efficiency.

In line with [[Bednekoff's Model]], empirical evidence suggests sentinel behavior is a state-dependent process linked with the energetic reserves of an individual. Yet, recent work on cooperative breeders suggests that sentinels are not as safe as the assumptions of the model implies. Likewise, supplemental feeding is linked with an increase in many other cooperative behaviors, not just sentinel behavior.

Sentinel behavior as an individual that ceases foraging and climbs to an elevated position to scan the area. (at least 10cm and 10s)

If sentinel behavior is truly selfish ([[Bednekoff's Model]]), then the [[Presence of young]] should not affect an individual's contribution or efforts. Otherwise, it could be an extension of [[parental care]] or cooperation in parental care.

Both male and females helpers were more likely to perform sentinel behavior in the [[Presence of young]]. <- cannot make causal relationship due to correlational nature of data. Increased presence of pups (most vulnerable to predation) might increase perceived [[predation]] risk.

It remains unclear whether sentinel behavior is a selfish or cooperative behavior.

Females helpers made more individual vigilance efforts than male helpers. Potentially due to increased benefits from larger group sizes.

Results suggest cooperative nature to sentinel behavior.
