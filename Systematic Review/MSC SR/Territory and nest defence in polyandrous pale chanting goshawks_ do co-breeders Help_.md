title: Territory and nest defence in polyandrous pale chanting goshawks: do co-breeders Help?
authors: G. Malan, A.R. Jenkins
year: 1996
species: Pale Chanting Goshawks
factor: [[Sex]]
effect: Females were the primary occupants of the sentinel role.

Females acted as sentinels, males brought prey to the females. <- [[Sex]]
Important to note that females are larger, and therefore [[Body Mass]] may be at play, though not tested.

Much discussion about energetic states, and it forcing females to choose between guarding and foraging. In times where male provisioning is plentiful, females will stay at nest sites <- Somewhat related to [[Bednekoff's Model]]

Helpers may have indirectly contributed to decrease nest predation by co-provisioning females, allowing them to sentinel for longer periods of time without having to leave the nestlings to forage.
