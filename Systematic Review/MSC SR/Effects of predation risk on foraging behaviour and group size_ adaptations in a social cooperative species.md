title: Effects of predation risk on foraging behaviour and group size: adaptations in a social cooperative species
authors: Enrico Sorato, Philippa R. Gullett, Simon C. Griffith, Andrew F. Russell
year: 2012
species: Chestnut-crowned Babblers
factor: [[Presence of young]] [[predation]] [[Time of Day]] [[Breeding Period]]
effect: The presence of young, breeding period and predation risk increased overall sentinel contributions. Time of day both increased and decreased sentinel contribution. If babblers foraged on the ground, sentinel activity increased as well.

Larger groups are beneficial due to many eyes or prey dilution effects. 
[[Group Size]] is predicted to increase with the relative costs of dispersing to breed independently (lack of mates or territories).
Relaxation of these costs resulted in increased dispersal of helpers and a decrease in group size.
[[predation]] risk could be an important mechanism for selection for group living.

Sentinel behavior defined as an individual standing guard from an elevated position while other group members forage.

[[predation]] risk known to influence individual behaviors including sentinel and foraging behaviors.

Frequency of sentinel behavior was affected by [[Time of Day]]. Increasing from early to late morning, decreased between midday and early afternoon and then increased again in the late afternoon

Increased sentinel behavior in areas of increased [[predation]] and when babblers were foraging on the ground <- [[Group Activity]]

Increased sentinel behavior in response to the [[Presence of young]] and during [[Breeding Period]].

Increased likelihood of a sentinel after a predator was detected. <- [[predation]] again.

[[Group Size]] had no effect on sentinel efforts.

Groups more often employed a sentinel when foraging on the ground and in high [[predation]] areas, as well as  in the [[Presence of young]] and following an encounter with a predator

Sentinel behavior occurs as a direct consequence of predator encounters.

Larger groups are more efficient at detecting predators than smaller groups.
