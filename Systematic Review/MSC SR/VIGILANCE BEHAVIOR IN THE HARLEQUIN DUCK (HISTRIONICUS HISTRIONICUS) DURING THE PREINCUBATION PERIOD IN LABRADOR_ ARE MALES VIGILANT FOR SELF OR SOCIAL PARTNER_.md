title: VIGILANCE BEHAVIOR IN THE HARLEQUIN DUCK (HISTRIONICUS HISTRIONICUS) DURING THE PREINCUBATION PERIOD IN LABRADOR: ARE MALES VIGILANT FOR SELF OR SOCIAL PARTNER?
authors: Squires, Kelly A., Martin, Kathy, and Goudie, R. Ian
year: 2007
species: Harlequin Duck
factor:
effect:

Typically, male vigilance is assumed to benefit males, either by ensuring their own survival or paternity.
As such, males should be more vigilant in the presence of conspecific males especially when females are laying eggs.

Another hypothesis is that males are vigilant for female benefits: enhanced female survival and forafing effectiveness.

No mention of sentinel behavior, reject.
