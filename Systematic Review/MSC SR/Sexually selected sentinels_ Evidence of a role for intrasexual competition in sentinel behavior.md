title: Sexually selected sentinels? Evidence of a role for intrasexual competition in sentinel behavior
authors: Lindsay A. Walker, Jenny E. York, Andrew J. Young

species: White-browed sparrow weavers
factor: [[Rank]] [[Sex]]
effect: Dominant males had greater sentinel contributions than any other individuals in the group, suggesting sentinel behavior may play a role in [[Intrasexual competition]].

Sentinel behavior as one individual who watches from an elevated position while other group member forage.

Sentinel behavior could provide benefits to the sentinel by providing a vantage point from which to detect and respond to same-sex competitors. Supported by findings that males sentinel more than females, suggesting differential benefits to males other than just mitigation of predation risk.

Sentinel behavior as a display of sexual or dominance status, or allow better detection of intruders and territory defense.
Females might also receive some of these benefits if there is same-sex competition.
Increased benefits to males because of transient males posing a threat to their dominance, also monitoring and calling to neighbouring individuals.
Sentinel as honest signal for quality.

During nonbreeding periods, the weavers sentinelled a mean of 21% of the time, with bouts lasting ~179.44s

No aggression towards individuals acting as sentinel: no individual interfered with the sentinel efforts of another individual.

Proportion of time an individual contributed to sentinel behavior was determined by a significant interaction of rank and sex, and unrelated to group size.

Dominant males sentineled more than any other individual, with dominant individuals sentineling more than subordinates <- [[Rank]] & [[Sex]]
When controlling for age, same effects.

No effect of body condition on sentinel contribution of males.
Subjecting a dominant male to the solo song of a foreign male increased that individual's sentinel contribution.

Dominant #Males display significantly more sentinel efforts than other groups members, and the difference in their contributions cannot be linked solely to variations in age or body condition.

Results from playback experiment suggests that sentinel behavior may facilitate the rapid initiation of counter intruder responses by dominant males who might have their dominance challenged by intruders. Ergo, sentinel behavior may play a role in intra sexual competition.

Differences in body condition (mass) could not be associated with dominance.
When controlling for body weight, [[Rank]] approached significance (p=0.053) even with a small sample size. It is possible that variations in nutritional states could be contributing to differences in sentinel behaviors.
Age is also not solely responsible for the changes in sentinel contribution, as they controlled for age ans still found [[Rank]] to have a significant effect on sentinel contribution.

Sentinel is not believed to play a role in generalized defense of a resource or territory, as we would expect to see dominant males and females sentineling equally. 
Main benefits therefore seem to be repelling same-sex competitors  and keeping an eye on group members/dominant female.<- [[Intrasexual competition]] and mate guarding.
Increased sentinel efforts of dominant males after hearing the playback of the solo song of a foreign male also support the hypothesis that sentinel behavior plays a role in [[Intrasexual competition]]
*** Experiment conducted during incubation period, when defense of dominance is highest prority.<- [[Breeding Period]]

Latency of males to respond to foreign male calls while foraging could be explained by males being in a poorer nutritional state when foraging, compared to when sentineling, consistent with the state-dependent hypothesis <- [[Bednekoff's Model]]
Could also be because immediately responding may incur increased lost-opportunity costs to doraging males (again, state dependence)

Sentinel behavior could also be a form of [[sexual display]], to inform would-be competitiors of who is the boss around here. Their presence could deter the weaker individuals, mitigating costs of territory or mate defense. At the same time, they are providing an honest signal of their quality to potential mates. However, they saw no interruptions or conflicts over who sentinels.

Together, our findings support the hypothesis that sentineling may also play a role in [[Intrasexual competition]], potentially facilitating the effective defense of both paternity and dominance status against extra-group challengers.
