title: FACULTATIVE COMMUNAL BROOD REARING IN CALIFORNIA QUAILâ€™
authors: Dale E Lo, Sonken A Mastr
year: 1999
species: California Quail
factor: [[Group Size]] or group [[Membership]]
effect: In larger broods, males "sentineled" less than non-brood males.

Sentinel behavior as male perching nearby incubating female.
Brood males spent less time vigilant and more time feeding and resting than non-brood males <- [[Group Size]] effect or [[Membership]] to group.

Brood-rearing extends an individual's reproductive career.

Honestly a pretty messy definition for sentinel behavior. Would not advise to rely on in the scoping review.
