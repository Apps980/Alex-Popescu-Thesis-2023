title: Sentinel behavior in captive meerkats ( <i>Suricata suricatta</i> )
authors: Florian D. Huels, Angela S. Stoeger
year: 2022
species: Meerkats
factor: [[Group Size]] [[Body Mass]]
effect:Heavier individuals guarded more, and more frequently (super sentinels). Lower group size increased individual contributions to sentinel behavior.

Sentinel behavior used interchangibly with guarding behavior.
Allows individuals to reduce their own vigilance while maintaining the alertness of the group.
Sentinel behavior defined by two main features:
- An individual scans for predators while other group members perform other activities
- Sentinels are usually in elevated positions to ensure good visibility over the environment.
Sentinel behavior may benefit the sentinel through increased social prestige and perceived mate quality.
Super sentinels, individuals with greatly increased vigilance are well fed, suggesting they are efficient foragers. This supports [[Bednekoff's Model]].
Sentinel behavior was positively correlated with [[Body Mass]], with super sentinels being the heaviest.
Smaller [[Group Size]] led to longer and more frequent guarding behavior for every individual per day.
Dominant female showed no sentry time, except in small group <- [[Rank]], [[Group Size]] and [[Sex]]
Sentinel behavior could be used as a form of status or [[sexual display]], leading to super sentinels.
