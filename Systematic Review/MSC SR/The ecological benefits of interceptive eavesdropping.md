There are two types of eavesdropping – interceptive (where absolute information in signals intended for one receiver is intercepted by another) and social (where relative information is gathered on other individuals by attending to their interactions with conspecifics).

Several studies have suggested that those species that are most vulnerable to predation – such as solitary species or those with a poorly developed alarm call repertoire – would benefit the most from cueing in on the information given by other species (that share a common predator) with more reliable alarm call behaviour. Limited empirical evidence to support this.

Social species as leaders, while solitary or less social species as followers.

Sentinel behavior as one group member perches above the group and remains vigilant for predators while the rest of the group forages.

Did not test any effects on sentinels, this is a mixed flock experiment, reject.
