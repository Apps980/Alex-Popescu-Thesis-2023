title: Sentinel dominance status influences forager use of social information
authors: Julie M. Kern, Seirian Sumner, Andrew N. Radford
year: 2016
species: Dwarf Mongoose
factor:[[Rank]] [[Group Size]]
effect: Dominant individuals of either sex had greater sentinel contributions than subordinate individuals.

To make informed decisions, animals use personal information from their own experiences, and social information gathered from other individuals.
The problem is the quality of the social information varies.
Individuals should adjust their reliance on social information when it is of poor quality.

Sentinel behavior as an individual that adopts a raised position, scanning for predators and warning other of danger. No mention of coordination.
Individual whose feet were at lest 10cm above ground, actively scanning while other groupmates engage in foraging (not exclusively).


Benefits of sentinel behavior, especially in mixed-species groups, will vary depending of the quality of the sentinel.
Pied Babbler reduces individual vigilance more when sentinels are positioned higher. <- Radford AN, Ridley AR. 2007. Individuals in foraging groups may use vocal cues when assessing their need for anti-predator vigilance.
Younger individuals (<1year) contribute much less to sentinel behavior <- [[maturity]]
Sentinel present in 56.5% of scans.
GLMM and LMM used. You're on the right track.
Fewer vigilance scans in foragers when subjected to playback surveillance calls.
[[Rank]] and [[Group Size]] had a significant effect on the likelihood of an individual to conduct a sentinel bout. 
Dominants were more likely to act as sentinel than subordinates.
Difference most apparent in large groups.
Sex had no effect.
Smaller groups led to an increase in the likelihood of an individual to act as a sentinel.
Dominant individuals acted as sentinel more often than the oldest subordinates, regardless of sex, group size or the interaction between group size and rank.
All individuals were more likely to conduct a sentinel bout in smaller groups.
Dominant individuals positioned themselves higher than subordinates when sentinelling. No effect of sex
Dominant dwarf mongooses of both sexes act as sentinel more often than subordinates.
Higher position = greater visibility = more reliable
[[Rank]] could be an honest signal of experience as a sentinel = more reliable.
When switching to dominant, immediately increase sentinel contribution.
Reliance on vocal cues is especially important in denser habitats, when visibility is limited, or when foraging and vigilance cannot be conducted simultaneously (e.g. burrowing)
Dominant individuals contribute to sentinel behavior more because they have access to higher-quality resources, and therefore have a better state than subordinates. More energy = greater ability to perform sentinel behavior. <- [[Bednekoff's Model]]
Could also be for territory defense.
Dominant individuals may also be more risk-tolerant, explaining their higher perching position.
