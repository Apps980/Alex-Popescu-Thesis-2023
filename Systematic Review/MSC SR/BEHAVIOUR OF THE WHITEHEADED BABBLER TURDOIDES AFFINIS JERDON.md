title: BEHAVIOUR OF THE WHITEHEADED BABBLER TURDOIDES AF FINIS JERDON
authors: V J Zacharias, D N Mathew
year: 1998
species: Whiteheaded Babbler
factor:[[Rank]] and [[maturity]]
effect: Older and breeding individuals sentineled more frequently and for longer than other individuals.

Sentinel behavior described as an individual taking position in a tree or bush, making alarm calls.

Sentinel duty shared by all members of the group, excluding juveniles <- [[maturity]]
Breeding and older birds act as sentinels more often and for longer than other birds. In one case, a male was sentinel for over 5 hours.
As the [[Time of Day]] progressed, so did sentinel efforts.

Sentinel behavior could be a display of rank

Overall, [[Rank]] and [[maturity]] seem to be drivers of increased sentinel contribution, likely due to increased experience and displays of quality/rank to group members. Increased time spent sentineling could be the result of increased foraging effectiveness, meaning they require less time to forage until critical energetic levels are met.
