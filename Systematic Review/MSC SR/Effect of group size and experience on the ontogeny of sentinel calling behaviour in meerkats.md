title: Effect of group size and experience on the ontogeny of sentinel calling behaviour in meerkats
authors: Ramona Rauber, Marta B. Manser
year: 2021
species: Meerkats
factor:[[Group Size]] and [[maturity]]
effect:Younger individuals contributed less than adults, but decreased [[Group Size]] led to sentinel behavior being performed at a younger age.

Sentinel as coordinated vigilance behavior where one individual climbs to an elevated position and scans the surroundings for predators while the rest of the group is foraging.
Foragers increase their foraging efficiency when a sentinel is present. Sentinel have greater visibility.
Younger meerkats sentineled less than adults <- [[maturity]] 
Young meerkats conducted their first sentinel bout at a later age in larger groups than sentinels in smaller groups, with no effect of sex <- [[Group Size]] 
Smaller [[Group Size]] could mean increased demand for sentinel duty, and therefore younger, less mature individuals are recruited for sentinel duty. The development of sentinel behavior is highly dependent on the social environment.
Related to individual energetic levels.
