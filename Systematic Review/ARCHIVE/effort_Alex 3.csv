We examined further detailed aspects of this cooperative behaviour, including the suggestion that by engaging in this behaviour sentinels advertise their status and gain social prestige. Chosen sentinel locations were higher, but no more exposed, than the best alternative locations within 25 m. Sentinels started off closer to the centre of the foraging group than when sentinel bouts were terminated. Change-overs between sentinels were nearly always due to previous sentinels terminating their own bout. On the rare occasions when bouts were interrupted by upcoming sentinels, physical contact or aggression was extremely rare. Dominant males tended to terminate sentinel bouts of other birds, interrupting especially the dominant females. Other than this, there was no effect of an individual's sex or dominance rank on any aspect of sentinel change-overs or location choice when acting as a sentinel. There were also no differences in any sentinel activity between simple family groups, and those more complex nonfamily groups within which individuals compete for reproduction. Rates of alarm calling did not differ between group members, although dominant males did make more territorial calls to neighbouring groups while acting as a sentinel. Therefore, we found relatively little evidence that individuals compete for the chance to act as a sentinel as a means of showing off within groups of Arabian babblers. Instead, our study confirms the primary function of sentinels as a system of cooperative vigilance. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

We examined how calls might facilitate sentinel coordination. Small soft calls labeled conversational gutturals were heard more often from sentinels than from foraging birds. Calls occurred infrequently throughout sentinel bouts but were more common later in bouts. The pattern of calling does not match predictions for a 'watchman's song' at regular intervals nor for a signal at the end of a sentinel bout. Thus, our quantitative assessment of calling by sentinels did not find support for either standard hypothesis. Although Florida scrub-jays clearly have information on each other's sentinel behavior, our results suggest that calls provide perhaps a fraction of this information."

Sentinel behaviour involves a unique cooperative system of dedicated look-outs which protect members of their social group from attack by predators. Using detailed observations from groups of Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps, we tested the original theoretical suggestion that cooperative sentinel systems are simply the result of individually selfish state-dependent patterns of behaviour.2. Sentinel effort and the number of sentinel bouts per individual per hour were greater for males than females, and both increased with individual dominance status within the group.3. Sentinel behaviour was unaffected by group social structure, in terms of patterns of relatedness and the number of potential breeders.4. Total group sentinel effort increased with group size, while the effort per individual decreased irrespective of sex and dominance rank. Simultaneous sentinel behaviour by two or more birds was very rare, but increased with group size.5. Sentinel effort followed seasonal fluctuations in food availability, but not peaks of raptor migration through the study site.6. Body mass was greater for males than females and was positively related to dominance rank. Overall, body mass explained much of the variation in individual sentinel effort both within and between birds. However, data on individual foraging performance could not be related to changes in body mass and thus to differences in sentinel effort.7. Sentinel behaviour in groups of Arabian babblers therefore confirms many of the predictions arising from state-dependent models of cooperative, yet individually selfish, sentinel behaviour."

If sentinel behavior involves a foraging-predation risk trade-off, animals should be sentinels more when fed supplemental food. When individual Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) were fed fragments of peanuts, during the following 30 min they shifted 30% of their time from foraging to sentinel behavior. In a follow-up experiment, we fed either one or two members in each group. As before, the jays reduced their foraging and spent much more time as sentinels when given supplemental food. In each treatment, pairs were sentinels simultaneously considerably less often than expected by chance. The dramatic shift from foraging to sentinel behavior suggests that for Florida scrub-jays sentinel behavior brings substantial benefits for no greater cost than that of lost opportunities to forage. Because the results held for simple mated pairs of scrub-jays, we argue that kin selection and social prestige are not necessary to explain sentinel behavior."

Most of the time these sentinels announce their guarding duty with special vocalizations. The response of foraging group members to these calls was investigated by analysing observational data, and by performing playback experiments. The use of special calls by sentinels, and the responses of the foraging group members to them, suggest that the coordination of vigilance is strongly influenced by vocal communication. Sentinel calls decreased the time spent alert by the foraging group members. Other group members were less likely to go on guard when a sentinel was vocalizing Both the proportion of time during which guards overlapped, and the proportion of time the group was unprotected without a guard, decreased when sentinels announced their duty, due to better coordination of the rotation of sentinels. Suricates, however, do not appear to use sentinel calls to mediate a strict rotation of guarding duty."

Specifically, we made four predictions: 1. Helpers participate to a non-trivial degree in sentinel behaviour; 2. Breeding pairs with helpers spend less time on sentinel behaviour and hence more time foraging; 3. Breeders with helpers have more protected foraging time; and 4. Groups with helpers have greater total sentinel time.Results of the two studies agreed on most major points and even, in many cases, on minor points and quantitative aspects. Non-breeding adult helper birds participated in sentinel watches almost as much as breeders in their group. In winter, breeding pairs with one or more helpers decreased their own sentinel time compared with that of unassisted pairs. However, in the one study, the concomitantly increased available foraging time of breeders was no better protected by another group member being on sentinel than in the lone pairs. Results of the other study showed a significant increase of protected foraging time for breeding males only. In winter, groups with helpers did not have increased total sentinel time; time was either the same (Study A) or significantly less (Study B). During nesting, breeders with helpers did not, decrease their sentinel effort relative to lone pairs. Instead, groups with helpers had a sentinel for more time. These results are interpreted as indicating that, in winter, sentinel behaviour is more important to antiraptor defense in lone pairs than larger groups. In groups with helpers the mere addition of extra pairs of eyes and ears may render formal sentinel behaviour less necessary, so breeders can decrease their sentinel time and increase their foraging time. During nesting, additional sentinels may be important for increased nest protection. The presence of helpers contributing to predator detection may thus be an important factor in the better annual survival and nesting success of breeders that have helpers (WOOLFENDEN & FITZPATRICK 1984)."

Consequently, the production of antipredator-related calls by young can differ from that of the same vocalizations given by adults. Sentinel behaviour is a coordinated vigilance behaviour, where one individual climbs on an elevated position and scans the surroundings for predators, while the rest of the group is mainly foraging. Meerkat, Suricata suricatta, sentinels produce six distinct sentinel call types, which inform other group members about the perceived predation risk, resulting in the adjustment of personal vigilance behaviour in foraging group members. Here, we investigated the onset of sentinel behaviour and the ontogeny of the different sentinel call types as well as the development of individual vocal signatures in meerkats. We found that meerkats started acting as a sentinel around 200 days of age, but this was highly dependent on group size, with individuals from smaller groups exhibiting sentinel behaviour earlier than individuals from larger groups. All six sentinel call types were already present in the repertoire upon first emergence of the behaviour; however, call rates of 'all-clear' calls increased while 'warning' calls decreased with increasing experience as sentinel. Analysis of one of the most frequent sentinel calls, the double note calls, indicated that fundamental frequency, mean amplitude, duration and entropy differed consistently between individuals, but we found no effect of age. Rather, our results provide evidence that individual signatures in this call type were already developed when young meerkats first started to act as sentinel and changed little with age. To conclude, we showed little ontogenetic change in overall sentinel behaviour as well as in its vocal coordination, indicating potentially high selection pressures on antipredator behaviours, such as the sentinel system, resulting in consistent behavioural responses upon first emergence.

An experimental investigation","ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR","85","137","142","10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.017","2013","Sentinel behaviour, where individuals take turns to watch for danger and give alarm calls to approaching predators, has been observed in a number of animal societies. However, the evolutionary causes of this behaviour remain unclear. There are two main, competing hypotheses regarding the evolution of sentinel behaviour. The first hypothesis is that it is a cooperative behaviour, where group members benefit from the detection of danger but share the workload of acting as a sentinel. The second is that it is a safe, selfish behaviour. Under the second hypothesis, once an individual is satiated, being a sentinel is safer because sentinels can detect threats more readily and can therefore escape from predators faster. We examined whether sentinels are safer than foragers in a wild, free-living cooperative bird (the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor) with a well-described sentinel system. We found that sentinel behaviour was costly because (1) sentinels were targeted by predators more often, (2) they were further from cover than foragers, and (3) they took longer to reach the safety of cover following a predator alarm. These results suggest that individuals do not become sentinels because it is safer. This is the first study to demonstrate that sentinels are at greater risk of predator attack than foraging group members and suggests sentinel activity may have evolved as a form of cooperative behaviour.

Hearing these calls, other group mates usually react by quickly changing their behaviour. Uttering alarm calls is an anti-predator mechanism with several possible functions. In this study our aim was to assess the function of alarm calls in the Arabian babbler Argya squamiceps, a cooperatively breeding songbird. We observed 10 groups in natural conditions and recorded 1000 reactions of 55 foraging group members to 268 sets of alarm calls uttered by the sentinels. The most frequent reaction of the group members to the sentinel's alarm calls was to stop foraging immediately, to fly up to the closest treetop and to start calling alarm calls. In all the recorded cases, the sentinel remained in place and continued to call. The alarm calls continued as long as the raptor could be seen, and then ceased gradually, after which babblers flew down and returned to foraging. We conclude that the main function of alarm calls in the Arabian babbler is pursuit deterrence. In particular, while foragers benefit from the information content of the sentinel's alarm calls and react on their basis, the raptor is the primary audience addressed by the calls uttered by the sentinel and the foragers who join it."

The optimal balance between sentinel activity and foraging may differ among dominant and subordinate individuals, as dominants are more efficient foragers. Two theoretical models pertain to this balance and predict when individuals with different foraging abilities should switch between the two activities on the basis of their energetic state. In one of these models, individuals must attain a critical energetic level by dusk to pass the night, and in the second model fitness is monotonically increasing with the energetic state. We tested these models in the cooperatively breeding Arabian babbler, Turdoides squamiceps. We measured the length of sentinel bouts and the gaps between them both in natural conditions and following experimental feeding. Following feeding ad libitum, subordinates expanded their sentinel bouts significantly more than dominants in comparison with natural conditions. These findings are consistent with the first model, but not with the second. In the experiment, we measured the mass of mealworms consumed by each individual following a sentinel bout relative to its body mass. This ratio was larger for subordinates, indicating that they ended their sentinel bouts at a lower energetic state than dominants. This finding is consistent with the second model, but not with the first. Immediately after eating ad libitum, in 62% of the cases the first behavior performed by the babblers was a new sentinel bout, but in 17% it was a mutual interaction with a groupmate, indicating that social interactions also play a role in the trade-off vis-a-vis sentinel activity."

While it is well established that there is variation due to differences in the costs and benefits for individuals of different sex, age and dominance status, shorter-term social, internal and environmental factors are also likely to be important. Sentinel behaviour, where individuals adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates forage, offers an opportunity to test hypotheses about context-dependent differences in contributions to group behaviour. Here we used field experiments to manipulate the conspecific audience, satiation state and perceived danger level of dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, to investigate how sentinel contributions are modulated by individual context. In addition to standard measures of sentinel behaviour (likelihood of becoming a sentinel, number of bouts, bout duration), we considered within-bout behaviour in terms of surveillance calls and attentiveness (head-scanning rate and distraction levels). We found that the presence of a neighbouring forager (audience) decreased sentinel contributions, while individuals increased their sentinel investment when satiated and experiencing an increased danger level. Changes in head-scanning rate provided evidence for an interaction between the effect of satiation and danger levels, demonstrating that sentinel attentiveness was influenced by changes in context. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour is strongly context dependent, with effects seen in initial bout and bout quantity decisions, as well as within-bout characteristics, and that individual contributions to group behaviours can vary depending on social, internal and environmental factors.

An application is proposed at two study sites in Europe-in Spain and in Italy-with two climatic contexts (semiarid and humid, respectively), with the objective of proving the essential role of multi-site training for a robust application of the proposed methodologies. Several classifiers are proposed to separate irrigated and rainfed areas. They are based on statistical variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series data at the agricultural field scale, as well as on the contrasted behavior between the field scale and the 5 km surroundings. The support vector machine (SVM) classification approach was tested with different options to evaluate the robustness of the proposed methodologies. The optimal number of metrics found is five. These metrics illustrate the importance of optical/radar synergy and the consideration of multi-scale spatial information. The highest accuracy of the classifications, approximately equal to 85%, is based on training dataset with mixed reference fields from the two study sites. In addition, the accuracy is consistent at the two study sites. These results confirm the potential of the proposed approaches towards the most general use on sites with different climatic and agricultural contexts."

The groups of whiteheaded babblers appear to be organised hierarchically. Calls appear to have a definite function in the species. Clumping, allopreening, sentinel system and the large repertoire of vocalizations may be helpful in consolidating the group and co-ordinating its movements."

Riverside clay-licks are sites where parrots and other species congregate to consume soil, usually in large numbers. Birds feeding on the clay are vulnerable to attack from predators. The Red-and-green Macaw Ara chloropterus can be observed in the vicinity of claylicks for much of the morning, although they spend only a small amount of time feeding on the clay itself. I investigated patterns of vigilance at a riverside claylick in Peru to test whether or not the birds engage in true sentinel behavior. There was no evidence for coordination of vigilance, and overall vigilance increased with the presence of more birds on the claylick, contrary to expectation. In addition, tall perches that should serve as sentinel positions were generally occupied less when birds were feeding on the claylick, and the probability of birds on the clay increased with increasing group size. Probability of calling, which could include warning information, was not higher as a function of bird presence on the clay, but was best explained by group size. All macaws maintained a generally high state of vigilance in the vicinity of the claylick, suggesting there was no reliance on a sentinel system. Further work is needed to understand the dynamics of this behavior for this species at one of southeastern Peru's most important ecotourism resources."

Previous studies of antipredator behaviour have tended to focus on foragers, whose vigilance behaviour may be confounded by the type of food they are eating, and on receivers in vocal communication networks. We examined the impact of habitat and wind conditions on the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that suspend their own foraging to adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates continue feeding, and that produce a variety of calls used by foragers to adjust their antipredator behaviour. Sentinels of the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding bird, started guarding sooner and guarded for longer in long grass compared to more open habitats, and also initiated sentinel bouts sooner in high wind, probably because of the increased predation risk in such circumstances. Sentinels also selected positions that were both lower and closer to the foraging group when it was windy, potentially improving transmission of vocal signals that are valuable to foragers. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour can be influenced by extrinsic factors, as well as the intrinsic factors previously shown, and suggest that ecological variation may affect decisions bearing both selfish and cooperative benefits.

Most forms of cooperative behavior have energetic costs and previous studies have shown that the contributions of individuals to alloparental provisioning are conditional on their food intake. However, the effect of naturally occurring, extreme environmental conditions on the persistence of costly forms of cooperative behaviors and their coordination by communication remain unknown. Here, we show that in meerkats (Suricata suricatta) the probability to act as sentinel, a cooperative vigilance behavior, was the same for typically occurring dry and wet conditions, but significantly reduced during a drought condition with almost no rain, especially in young individuals, members of small groups and groups with pups. The duration an individual stayed on sentinel guard, however, was most reduced during dry conditions. Besides reductions in sentinel behavior, the vocal coordination of foraging meerkats differed when comparing drought and wet conditions. Individuals responded more strongly to playbacks of sentinel all-clear calls and close calls, resulting in less vigilance and more foraging behavior during the drought condition. We conclude that while meerkats are adapted to commonly occurring dry periods with low rainfall, the extreme drought period with almost no rain, led to a decrease of the frequency of costly forms of cooperative behaviors in favor of behaviors that maximize direct fitness benefits and also affected the vocal coordination among group members."

In a descriptive field study I investigated alarm calling and sentinel activity in group-living Arabian Babblers Turdoides squamiceps focussing on the context-specificity of call type occurrence in relation to the caller's behaviour. The results revealed that two of the three different alarm call types were correlated to the distance to the predator: Barks were uttered more frequently to distant and tzwicks to close predators. Sentinels were more likely to utter barks and trills, but foraging group members tzwicks. Results suggest that sentinels detect potential dangers in greater distances and start calling earlier, whereas foraging birds detect predators only closer and therefore utter higher urgency calls.

Predation risk is affected by a range of ecological, social and individual variables, which can fluctuate over different timescales. In general, current risk levels are known to influence the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates are engaged in other activities. However, there has been little consideration of whether decisions made at different stages of a sentinel bout are affected in the same way by perceived predation risk and whether the same level of behavioural plasticity is exhibited when making these different decisions. Here we used detailed behavioural observations and a playback experiment to investigate the behavioural choices of dwarf mongoose sentinels at three different stages of a bout (before, start, during). Individuals were more likely to begin a bout, and did so sooner, following alarm calls, which are immediate, direct indicators of elevated risk. Sentinels selected an initial height from which to guard depending on factors that tended to vary in the medium term (hours), choosing higher positions in denser habitat and less windy conditions. In contrast, decisions about bout duration were made in relation to short-term (seconds/minutes) changes in information, with sentinels guarding for longer when an alarm call was given during a bout, and terminating bouts sooner when groupmates moved out of sight. Our results demonstrate that sentinel decisions are influenced by both direct and indirect indicators of likely predation risk and that sentinel behaviour is adjusted flexibly with regard to information presented on various timescales, highlighting the complexity of decision-making processes.

Multiple non-mutually exclusive hypotheses could explain synchronization: Barbary ground squirrels may perch because (1) neighbors are perched (copying effect), (2) perch synchrony may be an emergent property of the ecology as all squirrels may be satiated at the same time (collective behavior), or (3) the benefits are large in terms of evading ambush predators and scanning effectiveness (watch each other's back). Particularly, in habitats where the field of view is obstructed by man-made structures and multiple individuals may be necessary to watch for terrestrial predators, synchronized vigilance may have greater fitness benefits than sentinel behavior. We conclude that it is essential to test assumptions of coordination and, thus, to analyze coordination to describe sentinel systems. Significance statement Vigilance behavior can be vital to an animal's survival. Taking turns acting as sentinels or synchronizing vigilance bouts reduces the cost of the trade-off between feeding and predation risk. A sentinel system assumes that sentinels are vigilant from raised positions, warn group members of danger, and alternate vigilance bouts. However, the assumption of alternating vigilance bouts remains poorly tested. We tested this assumption in invasive Barbary ground squirrels. We found that instead of alternating, individuals synchronized their vigilance bouts. Perch synchrony may be (1) a response to perching group members (copying effect), (2) an emergent property of the species' ecology, and (3) an adaptation to anthropogenically altered habitats (watch each other's back)."

Individuals can acquire such information by observing the behaviour of others, but reliance on visual cues may be undermined by visual obstructions and social monitoring is often incompatible with foraging. Vocal communication does not require the close proximity of senders and receivers or the suspension of other activities, and there is increasing evidence that foragers can use vocalizations to inform decisions about their own vigilance. However, less work has focused on what factors influence signallers in this context. We used detailed behavioural observations and a playback experiment manipulating perceived risk to investigate the calling behaviour of dwarf mongoose sentinels. Sentinels vocalized more often in dense habitats and when foragers were further away, when visual cues were less likely to be useful. Sentinels also vocalized more in situations most advantageous to others, including when groupmates were likely to be distracted (e.g. when babysitting or foraging) and following an alarm call; sentinels may provide an 'all clear' signal. Call rate was reduced in high-risk situations, such as immediately after an alarm call. Individuals of different age, sex and dominance status varied in their likelihood of calling and their response to situations of similar risk, probably because of different cost-benefit trade-offs for separate classes. Our study offers strong evidence that dwarf mongoose sentinels are adjusting their vocal behaviour both to enhance the likelihood that groupmates are aware of their presence and to provide potentially valuable social information about current risk.

It remains unclear, however, whether these vigilance behaviours are selfish, and the benefits to other group members simply an unselected by-product, or whether they are forms of cooperation, and the benefits to group members a selective force favouring the behaviour. In meerkats, Suricata suricatta, both female and male helpers were more likely to perform sentinel behaviour after dependent pups had started joining the group on foraging trips. In addition, female helpers performed more bipedal vigilance and found less food when pups were in the group.

This is the logical result of certain technological developments that occurred over the last two decades, allowing UAVs to be equipped with different types of sensors that can provide high-resolution data at relatively low prices. However, despite the success and extraordinary results achieved by the use of UAVs, traditional remote sensing platforms such as satellites continue to develop as well. Nowadays, satellites use sophisticated sensors providing data with increasingly improving spatial, temporal and radiometric resolutions. This is the case for the Sentinel-2 observation mission from the Copernicus Programme, which systematically acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolutions, with a revisiting period of five days. It therefore makes sense to think that, in some applications, satellite data may be used instead of UAV data, with all the associated benefits (extended coverage without the need to visit the area). In this study, Sentinel-2 time series data performances were evaluated in comparison with high-resolution UAV-based data, in an area affected by a fire, in 2017. Given the 10-m resolution of Sentinel-2 images, different spatial resolutions of the UAV-based data (0.25, 5 and 10 m) were used and compared to determine their similarities. The achieved results demonstrate the effectiveness of satellite data for post-fire monitoring, even at a local scale, as more cost-effective than UAV data. The Sentinel-2 results present a similar behavior to the UAV-based data for assessing burned areas."

For the entire peninsula, we processed 149 images from the ascending orbit, 144 images from the descending orbit of Sentinel-1 (C-Band) and 24 ALOS-2 (L-band) images from the ascending orbit.

Since the study area is covered by dense settlements, the Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSI) technique was utilized to determine the landslide behaviors. According to the results, for both orbits of the Sentinel-1, the horizontal displacement and the vertical displacement were observed in the range of - 10 to 6 mm. Compared to the magnitude of displacement signal measured by Sentinel-1, ALOS-2 data has higher values due to the high surface penetration of the L-band. The results showed that most of the old landslide regions are reactivated. Horizontal movement derived through Sentinel-1 showed that the highest movement overlaps with old landslides. L-band ALOS-2 provided better spatial coverage of landslide movement than C-band Sentinel-1 data, especially at the rural part along the coast of the lake."

To examine the applicability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for large areas, we propose an approach to determine rice age, date of planting (dop), and date of harvest (doh) using a time series of Sentinel-1 C-band in the entire Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The effect of the incidence angle of Sentinel-1 data on the backscatter pattern of paddy fields was reduced using the incidence angle normalization approach with an empirical model developed in this study. The time series was processed further to reduce noise with fast Fourier transform and smoothing filter. To evaluate and improve the accuracy of SAR data processing results, the classification outcomes were verified with field survey data through statistical metrics. The findings indicate that the Sentinel-1 images are particularly appropriate for rice age monitoring with R-2 = 0.92 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 7.3 days (n = 241) in comparison to in situ data. The proposed algorithm for estimating dop and doh also shows promising results with R-2 = 0.92 and RMSE = 6.2 days (n = 153) and R-2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 5.7 days (n = 88), respectively. The results have indicated the ability of using Sentinel-1 data to extract growth parameters involving rice age, planting and harvest dates. Information about rice age corresponding to the growth stages of rice fields is important for agricultural management and support the procurement and management of agricultural markets, limiting the negative effects on food security. The results showed that multitemporal Sentinel-1 data can be used to monitor the status of rice growth. Such monitoring system can assist many countries, especially in Asia, for managing agricultural land to ensure productivity. (C) The Authors.

Accurate information about immediate safety while foraging may be provided by the sentinel, a high-perched non-foraging Babbler that actively scans and warns for predators. We tested whether, at this migratory hotspot, the bewildering number and diversity of potential avian predators (perhaps more than anywhere else in the world) may be more than a reliable sentinel could handle. We monitored ten Babbler groups regularly for a number of hours per day throughout the migration season, and scored whether the Babblers gave alarm calls when different bird species were in sight. Analyses showed that Babblers are very skilled in distinguishing between species of high and low predation threat (interspecific threat-sensitivity). In addition, Babblers distinguished accurately between encounters with dangerous vs. harmless individuals from predator species of potentially high predation threat (intraspecific threat-sensitivity). Overall, Babblers cautiously overestimated predation threat, probably because errors involving alarms for harmless predators have a lower fitness cost than errors involving attacks by dangerous predators that are ignored. However, fewer warnings were given for the more common predators of lower threat, which suggests that Babblers initially overestimated the risk of predation, but subsequently learned to assess the level of threat more accurately as soon as more information was available. Overall, our findings agree closely with theoretical predictions regarding adaptive and sophisticated anti-predation behaviour in a variable world."

An elevation dependent bias, which had not been properly predicted by the used antenna model, was found for all investigated modes. Offsets of up to 2 dB were determined during the SAR instrument calibration phase, in particular, for low and high elevation angles. Therefore, in order to correct these elevation biases, a radiometric refinement was carried out by European Space Agency in November 2015. After that, Sentinel-1A radiometric accuracy and long-term stability were analyzed over a period of 1.5 years. For this period, the absolute calibration factor and the channel imbalance were determined for the main imaging mode. Moreover, a slight drift of the derived calibration factor was observed starting from July 2016. At the same time an anomaly was detected in the front-end affecting several transmit and receive modules in one tile.

On the basis of numbers, timing of migration, plumage status and body mass, shorebirds could indicate whether ecological and climate systems are generally intact and stable at hemispheric scales, or whether parts of these systems might be changing. To develop this concept, we briefly review the worldwide shorebird migration systems before examining how local weather and global climatic features affect several performance measures of long-distance migrants. What do variations in numbers, phenotype and behaviour tell us about the dependence of shorebirds on weather and climate? How does data on migrating shorebirds integrate global environmental information? Documenting the dependencies between the population processes of shorebirds and global environmental features may be an important step towards assessing the likely effects of projected climate change. In the meantime we can develop the use of aspects of shorebird life histories on large spatial and temporal scales to assay global environmental change."

In the former, the onus has been on ecological and demographic factors that select for offspring philopatry; in the latter, the importance of factors such as foraging success and predation risk are more typically emphasized. We examined the association between predation risk and both group size and foraging behaviour in the chestnut-crowned babbler, Pomatostomus ruficeps, a family-living cooperatively breeding bird that does not appear to face classic ecological or demographic constraints on dispersal and breeding. Groups were more likely to encounter, and be attacked by, avian predators when dependent young were present. Large groups were also more likely to encounter a predator, but less likely to be attacked by it, consistent with a benefit of group living through early predator detection or confusion effects. In addition, the average risk of predation for a given individual was reduced in large groups compared to small ones, owing to the dilution effect. That predation might partly select for group living in this species is boosted by findings showing reductions in ground foraging and increases in sentinel behaviour when predation risk was higher. We conclude that predation might represent an important force selecting for sociality in chestnut-crowned babblers, and highlight the need for future studies to consider more explicitly inherent benefits to group living in the evolution of vertebrate cooperative breeding systems. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Quantifying the impact that these organisms have on their prey can be challenging, as direct observation and measurement of arthropod predation is difficult. The use of sentinel prey is one method to measure predator impact; however, despite widespread use, few studies have compared predation on different prey types within a single experiment. This study evaluated the predation rates on four sentinel prey items in grass and wheat fields in south-east Queensland, Australia. Attack rates on live and dead Helicoverpa armigera eggs, and dead H. armigera larvae and artificial plasticine larvae, were compared and the predators that were attracted to each prey type were documented with the use of field cameras. There was no significant difference in predation rates between sentinel eggs, while dead larvae were significantly more attacked than artificial larvae. Prey were attacked by a diverse range of predators, including ants, beetles, various nymph and juvenile insects and small mammals. Different predators were active in grass and crop fields, with predator activity peaking around dawn and dusk. The same trends were observed within and between the two habitats studied, providing a measure of confidence in the sentinel prey method. A range of different sentinel prey types could be suitable for use in most comparative studies; however, each prey type has its own benefits and limitations, and these should be carefully evaluated to determine which is most suitable to address the research questions."

Fire intensity as defined by Byram (1959) is the most commonly used term describing fire behavior in the wildfire community. It is, however, difficult to observe from space. Here, we assess fire spread and fire radiative power using infrared sensors with different spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. The sensors used offer either high spatial resolution (Sentinel-2) for fire detection, but a low temporal resolution, moderate spatial resolution and daily observations (VIIRS), and high temporal resolution with low spatial resolution and fire radiative power retrievals (Meteosat SEVIRI). We extracted fire fronts from Sentinel-2 (using the shortwave infrared bands) and use the available fire products for S-NPP VIIRS and Meteosat SEVIRI. Rate of spread was analyzed by measuring the displacement of fire fronts between the mid-morning Sentinel-2 overpasses and the early afternoon VIIRS overpasses. We retrieved FRP from 15-min Meteosat SEVIRI observations and estimated total fire radiative energy release over the observed fire fronts. This was then converted to total fuel consumption, and, by making use of Sentinel-2-derived burned area, to fuel consumption per unit area. Using rate of spread and fuel consumption per unit area, Byram's fire intensity could be derived. We tested this approach on a small number of fires in a frequently burning West African savanna landscape. Comparison to field experiments in the area showed similar numbers between field observations and remote-sensing-derived estimates. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first direct estimate of Byram's fire intensity from spaceborne remote sensing data. Shortcomings of the presented approach, foundations of an error budget, and potential further development, also considering upcoming sensor systems, are discussed."

Here, we investigate the response of cooperatively breeding pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) to the drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis), an avian kleptoparasite that regularly follows pied babbler groups, often giving alarm calls to alert the group to predators but also occasionally giving false alarm calls in order to steal food items. We show that pied babbler response to drongos varies markedly according to babbler group size. In small groups, where there are few individuals available to act as sentinels, babblers sentinel less when a drongo is present and respond strongly to drongo alarm calls. However, in large groups, where there are many individuals available to participate in predator vigilance, babblers sentinel more often when a drongo is present, rarely respond to drongo alarm calls, and aggressively displace drongos, with a consequent decline in the number of successful kleptoparasitism events. This behavior represent a facultative response to a kleptoparasite according to the costs versus benefits of tolerating their presence."

The landslide occurred in the early morning of 24 June 2017 and killed more than 100 people in the village of Xinmo. Sentinel-1 images have been processed through an advanced multi-interferogram analysis capable of maximising the density of measurement points, generating ground deformation maps and displacement time series for an area of 460 km(2) straddling the Minjiang River and the Songping Gully. InSAR data clearly show the precursors of the slope failure in the source area of the Maoxian landslide, with a maximum displacement rate detected of 27 mm/year along the line of sight of the satellite. Deformation time series of measurement points identified within the main scarp of the landslide exhibit an acceleration starting from April 2017. A detailed time series analysis leads to the classification of different deformation behaviours. The Fukuzono method for forecasting the time of failure appear to be applicable to the displacement data exhibiting progressive acceleration. Results suggest that satellite radar data, systematically acquired over large areas with short revisiting time, could be used not only as a tool for mapping unstable areas, but also for landslide monitoring, at least for some typologies of sliding phenomena."

Several secondary iron minerals are precipitated in these settings that can be detected via remote sensing applications. The purpose of this research is to investigate the capacity of hyperspectral analysis to determine the abundance of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)-indicator secondary iron minerals in mine sites with the guidance of ground truth information. To this end, we focus on an abandoned coal mine site in Turkey to detect secondary iron minerals associated with AMD via multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery, in accordance with the laboratory analysis of fieldcollected samples through X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Inductive Coupled Plasma (ICP), and ASD spectral analysis. In relation with the conducted laboratory XRD and ICP results, the proposed methodology first reveals the iron-induced absorption feature located between 700 and 900 nm on field-collected ASD spectra and reference USGS spectra through a baseline method, namely parabola fitting method. The subsequent remote sensing analysis then applies hyperspectral unmixing to Sentinel-2 imagery and identifies the spectral endmember indicating iron-absorption behavior by computing its spectral angle distance to reference spectra. The experiments reveal that while the iron absorption characteristics are not apparent in pixel spectra, the utilized unmixing methodology enables capturing of those features at sub-pixel level on the resulting endmembers. Second, the comparison between the calculated abundances with unmixing and iron levels obtained with ground based ICP analysis indicate coherent correlation values. Finally, among the utilized unmixing methods, the performance of SISAL is found better than MVSA with the resulting correlation values of 0.76 and 0.63, respectively, while also returning closer endmembers to the reference iron spectra. The performed research demonstrates the potential of hyperspectral applications on Sentinel-2 data to uncover the sub-pixel iron-induced spectral features in the visible region, proving compatible results between the spectral and laboratory analysis."

Field trials with sentinel eggs of C. miles were conducted in SW Spain oak forests in which O. rudnevi was known to occur, using as positive controls sentinel eggs of both Cerambyx (Cerambyx) cerdo Linnaeus, 1758, and Cerambyx (Cerambyx) welensii (Kuster, 1845), the only two O. rudnevi hosts known to date. Laboratory assays were conducted using non-choice tests and choice tests (C. miles vs. C. cerdo). Results showed that C. miles eggs were attacked and successfully parasitised by O. rudnevi in the wild, uncorrected parasitism rates (P-U) being similar to those of C. cerdo and C. welensii (2.2-5.2%), and net parasitism rates (P-N) even significantly higher in C. miles (8.9%) than in C. welensii (3.3%). Interestingly, C. miles sentinel eggs were parasitised in holm oak forests in which C. miles was unknown to occur, suggesting that egg-derived volatile cues were important in host location. In the laboratory, non-choice tests showed no differences in P-N among C. miles, C. cerdo and C. welensii (80-88%), signifying that O. rudnevi performed alike in the three hosts. Choice tests showed that O. rudnevi did not exhibit host preference between C. miles (53%) and C. cerdo (47%). Similar tests proved that eggs of Cerambyx (Microcerambyx) scopolii Fuessly, 1775, and Prinobius myardi Mulsant, 1842, were never selected as hosts by O. rudnevi.

This coordination may rely on intrapair acoustic communication, which is surprisingly poorly understood. Here we examined the impact of an increased level of background noise on intrapair acoustic communication at the nest in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. We monitored how partners adapted their acoustic interactions in response to a playback of wind noise inside the nestbox during incubation. Both zebra finch parents incubate and use coordinated call duets when they meet at the nest. The incubating parent can vocalize to its partner either outside the nestbox (sentinel duets) or inside the nestbox (relief and visit duets), depending on the context of the meeting. Pairs use these duets to communicate on predation threats (sentinel duets), incubation duties (relief) and other nesting activities (visit duets). Each of these duets probably represents a critical component of pair coordination. In response to the noise playback, partners called less and more rapidly during visit and relief duets. Female and male calls were more regularly and precisely alternated during relief duets. Mates increased the number of visit duets and their spatial proximity during sentinel duets. Furthermore, both females and males produced louder, higher-frequency and less broadband calls. Taken together our results show that birds use several strategies to adjust to noise during incubation, underlining the importance of effective intrapair communication for breeding pairs.

Whilst a number of different methodologies are currently in use, little is known about how arthropod predators respond to artificially manipulated sentinel prey in comparison with predation on free-living prey populations. We assessed how attack rates on immobilized (aphids stuck to cards) and artificial (plasticine lepidopteran larvae mimics) sentinel prey differed to predation on free-moving live prey (aphids). Predation was assessed in response to density of the common invertebrate predators, a foliar-active ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and a ground-active beetle Pterostichus madidus (Coleoptera: Carabidae). Significant increases in attack rates were found for the immobilized and artificial prey between the low and high predator density treatments. However, an increased predator density did not significantly reduce numbers of free-living live aphids included in the mesocosms in addition to the alternate prey. We also found no signs of predation on the artificial prey by the predator H. axyridis. These findings suggest that if our assessment of predation had been based solely on the foliar artificial prey, then no increase in predation would have been found in response to increased predator density. Our results demonstrate that predators differentially respond to sentinel prey items which could affect the level of predation recorded where target pest species are not being used."

Moreover, there is a lack of robust information on the expansion and the GLOF hazard status of glacial lakes in the Bhutan Himalaya. We mapped Bhutanese glacial lakes from the 1960s to 2020, and used these data to determine their distribution patterns, expansion behavior, and GLOF hazard status. 2,187 glacial lakes (corresponding to 130.19 +/- 2.09 km(2)) were mapped from high spatial resolution (1.82-7.62 m), Corona KH-4 images from the 1960s. Using the Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Sentinel-1 (20 m x 22 m), we mapped 2,553 (151.81 +/- 7.76 km(2)), 2,566 (152.64 +/- 7.83 km(2)), 2,572 (153.94 +/- 7.83 km(2)), 2,569 (153.97 +/- 7.79 km(2)) and 2,574 (156.63 +/- 7.95 km(2)) glacial lakes in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The glacier-fed lakes were mainly present in the Phochu (22.63%) and the Kurichu (20.66%) basins. A total of 157 glacier-fed lakes have changed into non-glacier-fed lakes over the 60 years of lake evolution. Glacier-connected lakes (which constitutes 42.25% of the total glacier-fed lake) area growth accounted for 75.4% of the total expansion, reaffirming the dominant role of glacier-melt water in expanding glacial lakes. Between 2016 and 2020, 19 (4.82 km(2)) new glacial lakes were formed with an average annual expansion rate of 0.96 km(2) per year. We identified 31 lakes with a very-high and 34 with high GLOF hazard levels. These very-high to high GLOF hazard lakes were primarily located in the Phochu, Kurichu, Drangmechu, and Mochu basins. We concluded that the increasing glacier melt is the main driver of glacial lake expansion. Our results imply that extending glacial lakes studies back to the 1960s provides new insights on glacial lake evolution from glacier-fed lakes to non-glacier-fed lakes. Additionally, we reaffirmed the capacity of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to determine annual glacial lake changes. The results from this study can be a valuable basis for future glacial lake monitoring and prioritizing limited resources for GLOF mitigation programs."

CDC Fay-Prince light trap was effective in trapping Cx. quinquefasciatus than BG-Sentinel traps. The results indicated that both traps were ineffective to capture Ae. albopictus. In this study, the peak activity of Ae. albopictus was not following the diel host-seeking activity which this species active at daylight (6:00am-8:00am) and during night time (6:00pm-8:00pm). Whereas, Cx. quinquefasctus was captured mostly during the nocturnal time (12:00am-6:00am) with a greater number of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes captured under no light conditions. Meteorological parameter recorded within experiment such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed did not correlate with the abundance of both mosquito species (p> 0.05). However, light intensity parameters significantly affected Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquito abundance in both residential areas (p= 0.002), but not the Ae. albopictus mosquitoes (p= 0.086 Sungai Dua; p= 0.803 Batu Maung) as light is not a primary cue attraction factor to any host source towards this species.

As a conclusion, BG-Sentinel trap and CDC Fay-Prince light traps is a not suitable tool for monitoring the activities of Ae. albopictus in the residential area, but CDC Fay-Prince light traps still found effective to use to capture Cx. quinquefasciatus.

Mean catch rate for small mesh gillnets was consistently higher than that of large mesh gillnets for the entire time-series: peaking at 142 fish per net in 1996, and then averaging 11-36 fish/net; except for its lowest value of 6 fish/net in 2011. Large mesh gillnets yielded the lowest mean catch rate of all gears: declining from 49 fish/net in 1997 to less than 9 fish/net since 2000. Mean catch rate for linetrawls peaked at 223 fish per 1,000 hooks in 1996, and fluctuated around 100 fish/1,000 hooks until 2010 (except in 2006); prior to reaching its lowest value of 62 fish/1,000 hooks in 2014-2015. Sentinel catch rates for large mesh gillnet and linetrawl  control locations were standardized using Generalized Linear Models. Age-disaggregated standardized catch rates for recent year-classes were generally weaker than those in the past; although proportions-at-age of large mesh gillnet catch rates suggested that the 2008 year-class was relatively stronger. Age-aggregated catch rates were higher at the beginning of each time-series for both gears, declined over the mid-tolate 1990s, then remained at their lowest levels; decreasing below the series' mean of 6.4 fish/net (large mesh gillnets) in 1999, and 86 fish/1,000 hooks in 2009 (linetrawls). Gillnet and linetrawl catch rates for 2016 were 1.5 fish/net and 57.5 fish/1,000 hooks, respectively. Length frequencies of Atlantic Cod measured in Sentinel Surveys indicated that the small mesh gillnet was the least selective gear (retaining small and large fish from multiple year-classes), whereas large mesh gillnets and linetrawls captured larger fish in specific size ranges and few overlapping year-classes. Fish lengths from small mesh gillnets showed several modes between 35 cm and 62 cm throughout the time-series, while those of fish from large mesh gillnets and linetrawls ranged between 62-68 cm and 54-62 cm, respectively. Indices describing the physiological condition of Atlantic Cod varied at both seasonal and annual scales: the liver (hepatosomatic index) and gutted body condition (Fulton's K condition factor) declined over winter and early spring (while the gonadosomatic index increased), then improved over summer after spawning. These trends varied annually over the time-series, but generally declined in 2004-16. Both length and weight-at-age (6+ years) have decreased since the early part of each time-series."

Since 1958, it has had five moderate/major movements that catastrophically damaged the intersecting U.S. Highway 101, along with persistent slow wet-season movements and a long-term accelerating trend due to coastal erosion. Multiple remote sensing approaches, borehole measurements, and hydrological observations have been integrated to interpret the motion behaviors of the slide. Pixel offset tracking of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images was carried out to reconstruct the 3-D displacement field of the 2019 major event, and the results agree well with field measurements. A 12-year displacement history of the landslide from 2007 to 2019 has been retrieved by incorporating offsets from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model (DEM) gradients and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing of ALOS and Sentinel-1 images. Comparisons with daily/hourly ground precipitation reveal that the motion dynamics are predominantly controlled by intensity and temporal pattern of rainfall. A new empirical threefold rainfall threshold was therefore proposed to forecast the dates for the moderate/major movements. This threshold relies upon antecedent water-year and previous 3-day and daily precipitation and was able to represent observed movement periods well. Adaptation of our threshold methodology could prove useful for other large, deep landslides for which temporal forecasting has long been generally intractable. The averaged characteristic hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity were estimated as 6.6 x 10(-6) m/s and 6.6 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, respectively, based on the time lags between rainfall pulses and slide accelerations. Hydrologic modeling using these parameters helps to explain the ability of the new rainfall threshold."

It takes advantage of its enhanced along-track resolution to make measurements of sea surface height variations in much greater detail than what can be achieved with conventional low resolution instruments (e.g. the Jason-3 altimeter). However, contrary to what is observed for conventional altimetry, long-wavelength ocean waves of a few hundred meters (swell and extreme wind waves) are no longer fully imaged in the instrument ground cells, and SAR waveforms have distorted shapes in such wave conditions. This affects the final retrieval of significant wave height-(SWH). This paper analyzes the impact of long ocean waves on SAR mode data by using both Cryosat-2 measurements and simulated data. Results from these two approaches are in good agreement and show that the estimated parameters from SAR-altimetry waveforms are particularly noisy under long-wave conditions and also biased when compared with conventional altimetry data. Additionally, we found evidence that these impacts are different between the two directions (along and cross-track directions) due to the asymmetry of the SAR-altimetry footprint. Simulations indicate that statistics of sea surface elevations within the SAR-altimetry footprint deviate from Gaussian behavior. The assumption commonly used for ocean retracking algorithms is therefore inaccurate. The sensitivity of SAR-mode altimetry data to long waves is a key issue for the ocean altimetry community, which is concerned to ensure the continuity of high-quality time series of the global sea-surface topography in future years. This is not only an issue for these new-generation radar altimeters (Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-6) but also for all innovative techniques or processing methodologies capable of providing higher spatial resolution of the ocean surface.

However, recent advancements in satellite remote sensing, including the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) offer new tools for generating satellite derived bathymetry (SDB). The key payload onboard ICESat-2 is the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a micro-pulse, photon-counting LiDAR system, simultaneously emitting six separate 532 nm beams at 10 kHz pulse rate. However, despite its high resolution, the major limitation for bathymetry is that ICESat-2 only provides along-track height profiles, leaving observation gaps between the parallel ground tracks. Merging ICESat-2 observations with optical multispectral imagery, as demonstrated herein, provides an effective solution for deriving a full scene of water depth in light of the spectral attenuation behavior.This study aims to combine ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 optical data to derive shallow water bathymetry (depth <20 m) at six islands and reefs in the South China Sea. ICESat-2 ATL03 point clouds of georeferenced photons are first filtered to determine the seafloor elevation along the ground track. Results indicate a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.26-0.61 m as compared with independent observations from an airborne LiDAR campaign. Next, three semi-empirical functions, namely the Modified Linear/Polynomial/Exponential Ratio Models with its kernel formed by the log ratio between Sentinel-2's green and blue bands, are used to fit the spectral data with ICESat-2 height profiles. After water depth mapping using the trained model, independent ICESat-2 point clouds are used to validate the Sentinel-2 derived bathymetry. The RMSE values of the three models using the weighted average of multiple images for these six islands are within 0.50-0.90 m in 0-15 m deep. We also demonstrate that a synthesis of satellite laser altimetry and optical remote sensing can produce SDB results that potentially meet the requirement of category C in Zones of Confidence (ZOC) of the Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) in 0-8 m deep. It is foreseen that ICESat-2 will be a helpful tool for mapping coastal and shallow waters around the world especially where bathymetric data are unavailable."

Although substantial evidence exists for intraspecific variation in responses to other anthropogenic disturbances, this possibility has received relatively little experimental attention with respect to noise. Here, we used field-based playbacks with dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula) to test how traffic noise affects vigilance behavior and to examine potential variation between individuals of different age class, sex, and dominance status. Foragers exhibited a stronger immediate reaction and increased their subsequent vigilance (both that on the ground and as a sentinel) in response to traffic-noise playback compared with ambient-sound playback. Traffic-noise playback also resulted in sentinels conducting longer bouts and being more likely to change post height or location than in ambient-sound playback. Moreover, there was evidence of variation in noise responses with respect to age class and dominance status but not sex. In traffic noise, foraging pups were more likely to flee and were slower to resume foraging than adults; they also tended to increase their vigilance more than adults. Dominants were more likely than subordinates to move post during sentinel bouts conducted in traffic-noise trials. Our findings suggest that the vigilance-foraging trade-off is affected by traffic noise but that individuals differ in how they respond. Future work should, therefore, consider intra-population response variation to understand fully the population-wide effects of this global pollutant."

Four dates of S-1 data, between July and August, and three dates R-2 quad pol data between September and October were used during the Kharif season of 2019 for part of Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The study area's principal crops are rice and soybean, while minor crops are maize, pigeon pea, etc. A comprehensive approach combining principal component analysis, separability analysis, and layer-layer correlation was used to select the best seven dates/layers dataset for crop classification. Supervised machine learning classification algorithms of support vector machine (SVM), random forest, spectral angle mapper, and maximum likelihood classification were performed on the best set of S-1 and R-2 SAR selected dataset. Additionally, Wishart unsupervised classification was also performed on R-2 fully polarimetric data to classify the crops based on their scattering behavior. The results from five classification techniques were compared for their accuracy using ground truth data. It was observed that SVM, followed by Wishart, performed better than all other classification techniques regarding crop classification and area estimation accuracy. Overall, the study showed that an optimal combination of multi-date and multi-polarization SAR data from different satellites with a suitable classification technique is useful for crop area estimation at the field level, during Kharif season."

Recent research has suggested that some species are information givers', particularly social species with cooperative vigilance systems, and that these species may consequently affect community structure by influencing the behaviour and niche utilization of other species. Here, using behavioural observations and playback experiments, we compared the behavioural change in a solitary species (the scimitarbill) and a social species (the pied babbler), to the presence and alarm calls of one another. Our results revealed that scimitarbills underwent significant behavioural changes in the presence of social pied babblers: they reduced their vigilance rate by over 60%, increased their foraging efficiency and expanded their niche by moving into open habitat and excavating subterranean food items. In contrast, pied babblers - who have an effective intraspecific sentinel system - did not show significant behavioural changes to the presence or alarm calls of scimitarbills. These results suggest that interspecific interceptive eavesdropping can provide significant benefits, influencing the behaviour and habitat utilization of eavesdropping species."

Attracticide treatments were applied using a calibrated hand pump, and treated plots were compared to similar untreated plots. Male moth activity was monitored using virgin female-baited traps, and the potential for reduction in mating activity was assessed using sentinel virgin females. A comparison of application rates showed that 1500 droplets per ha of the attracticide formulation was as effective as 3000 droplets per ha, and both application rates reduced captures in synthetic pheromone-baited traps for prolonged periods. Droplets placed either at high or low positions within the canopy significantly reduced trap capture and mating with sentinel females. In addition, the only sentinel females that mated in the treated plots were located in the untreated portion of the tree canopy. Mate finding behaviour was equally disrupted by formulations with and without insecticide. Therefore, under the test conditions, the mechanism by which the attracticide formulation worked was by disruption of male orientation, and not by the removal of males due to insecticide poisoning. Two field cage experiments tested the impact of population density on the competitiveness of the attracticide formulation compared to virgin females. A significant proportion of males were captured in female-baited traps at the highest female-to-droplet ratio tested. Equal proportions of males were captured in attracticide-baited traps at male moth densities of 10, 20, 40, and 80 males per cage. These results clarify some of the factors influencing the effectiveness and possible mechanisms of an attracticide management tactic against the Oriental fruit moth."

To quantify these benefits, supervise and encourage the adoption of this practice, robust and affordable monitoring indicators of the cover crop dynamic and its biomass are required. This work represents the first attempt to estimate the biomass produced by olive grove cover crops based on remotely sensed data and an adaptation of the Monteith efficiencies approach. Ten olive tree fields were selected, distributed in three zones of Southern Spain. They comprised a high environmental variability and differed in the herbaceous layer management: cover crop in strips; non-tillage without strips (full coverage); and conventional tillage. An adaptation of the LUE (Light Use Efficiency)-model was applied to estimate Net Primary Production (NPP) using meteorological and Sentinel-2 data and subtracting the contribution of the wooded vegetation from the ground spectral response. The results showed an uneven adjustment in different fields. RMSD was equal to 650 kg ha-1, with an MBD of -17 kg ha-1, indicating a moderately high error (around 39%) but not too much bias. This error suggests that the model requires further refining, including the adjustment of model parameters to better represent this agrosystem. However, the evolution of biomass accumulation throughout the cover crop growing season and the behaviour of the daily biomass production provided interesting keys about the cover crops' phenology and management, supporting the discrimination between management practices."

The SAR images were first calibrated, geometrically corrected, and filtered. Then, the threshold method was applied to draw the map of the affected areas. The results showed that flood spatial propagation varies through time. The nature of spatial extent was sinusoidal, so that the flood behavior complied with precipitation periods. Furthermore, the findings of the SBAS-InSAR indicated how an extreme flood can cause ground displacement. Several active movement areas were identified, showing a surface velocity up to -1.1 mm day(-1) away from the satellite. The field observations demonstrated that the landslide phenomenon occurred in some of these areas. Therefore, the other identified areas can also be at risk of landslides. Finally, based on the findings, it is evident that SAR data can effectively be used for flood water mapping, flood monitoring, and flood-induced ground displacement."

However, such large volumes of high-resolution data pose challenges to users in terms of problem complexity, computational resources and processing time, beckoning the increasingly relevant question: at which resolution should this imagery be processed? Here, we develop a methodology to characterize resolution-dependent errors in cropland mapping and explore their behavior when we move across spatial scales and landscapes, taking special care to include the effects of the instrument's Point Spread Function (PSF). Results show how local upscaling of 10-m imagery, e.g., from Sentinel-2, to 30 m mitigates most the adverse effects generated by the PSF when comparing it to native 30-m imagery, e.g., from Landsat-8. Extending this logic, we demonstrate for two nationwide cases how maps can be calculated showing the optimal spatial resolution that keeps resolution-dependent errors below a user-defined threshold. Based on these maps, we estimate that 31% of Belgium and 59% of South Africa could be processed at 20 m instead of 10 m, while keeping the increase of resolution-dependent errors below 3%. These local resolution adjustments lead to a reduction in data volume and processing time by 23% and 44%, respectively."

This paper presents the possibility of using SAR technology for long-term observations of changes in the behaviour of rivers and river systems, combined with optical multispectral images Sentinel-2. Additionally, it aims to demonstrate the suitability of satellite SAR and multispectral data implementation for mapping changes in watercourses, caused not only by their natural development but especially by inundation processes in their catchment area. Appropriate Sentinel-1 image processing evaluation procedures demonstrate that the usage of vertical-vertical (VV) type polarisation configuration is a suitable methodology for documenting water bodies, and a Lee filter is an acceptable tool for radar noise filtering. The extraction process of water surfaces is based on the determination of threshold values using the Otsu principle. Subsequently, the comparison of the results is realised by the spectral indices of water-the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), a pair of Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) indices, and supervised classification method Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). The results are numerical and graphical evaluated. In assessing the accuracy of SAR extraction, the highest values achieved in Overall Accuracy (OA) were a maximum of 98.6%.

Surface and canopy fuels characteristics were sampled in a small managed temperate forest in Northern Germany. Custom fuel models were created for each dominant species (Pinus sylvestris, Fagus sylvatica, and Quercus rubra). Canopy cover, canopy height, and crown base height were directly derived from airborne LiDAR point clouds. Surface fuel types and crown bulk density (CBD) were predicted using random forest and ridge regression, respectively. Modeling was supported by 119 predictors extracted from LiDAR, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 data. We simulated fire spread from random ignitions, considering eight environmental scenarios to calculate fire behavior and hazard. Fuel type classification scored an overall accuracy of 0.971 (Kappa = 0.967), whereas CBD regression performed notably weaker (RMSE = 0.069; R-2 = 0.73). Higher fire hazard was identified for strong winds, low fuel moisture, and on slopes. Fires burned fastest and most frequently on slopes in large homogeneous pine stands.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of deployment duration (2-5 d) on parasitism and predation of brown marmorated stink bug sentinel egg masses in plum, peach, blueberry, tomato, sassafras, corn, and soybean in these 2 states. Retrieved egg masses were processed to quantify rates of predation and parasitism and identify parasitoid species and predation types. Across crops, predation and parasitism were higher significantly in plum at 5 d compared to 2 d deployment but was similar in soybean regardless of exposure time in 2017. Predation and parasitism were higher significantly after 5 d of exposure compared to 2 d and 3 d whereas parasitism was significantly higher at 3 d compared to 2 d exposure in 2018 to 2020. For individual crop trials, though, effects of time of exposure were tested in different yr, sampling dates, and crops with variable results. When significant differences were detected for parasitism in plum, peach, tomato, and sassafras, a 5 d deployment resulted in higher parasitism compared to 2 d. Given the variability of factors that affect parasitism and predation under field conditions, we conclude that a 5 d deployment is optimal and a 3 d exposure time is minimal for assessing predation and parasitism. An additional benefit for a 5 d exposure is that it increases the probability of detecting hyperparasitism."

The SqueeSAR algorithm was applied to two C-band SAR datasets, composed by Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 images, spanning a nine-year time interval before the landslide occurrence. Moreover, the amplitude information carried by two TerraSAR-X images, acquired immediately before and after the event, was exploited to derive the total displacement generated by the landslide movement by means of the RMT (rapid motion tracking) algorithm. The obtained results allow describing the landslide behavior before and after its failure. In particular, the back-monitoring analysis shows that the landslide was already slowly moving, with deformation rates increasing from the Radarsat-2 to the Sentinel-1 monitored periods, 10 years before its complete mobilization. The landslide failure of February 2017 produced maximum displacements of about 10 m in some sectors of the affected area. The registered deformation rates and the localization of the maximum displacements areas were confirmed by field data, collected during a field campaign and a helicopter recognizance of the damaged areas, both performed after the event."

Automated image analysis however often relies on extensive datasets, not implementable by small research teams. We are here proposing an object detection method that allows the analysis of high-resolution images containing many animals interacting in a small dataset. We developed an image analysis pipeline named 'CORIGAN' to extract the characteristics of animal communities. CORIGAN is based on the YOLOv3 model as the core of object detection. To illustrate potential applications, we use images collected during a sentinel prey experiment. Our pipeline can be used to detect, count and study the physical interactions between various animals. On our example dataset, the model reaches 86.6% precision and 88.9% recall at the species level or even at the caste level for ants. The training set required fewer than 10 hr of labelling. Based on the pipeline output, it was possible to build the trophic and non-trophic interactions network describing the studied community. CORIGAN relies on generic properties of the detected animals and can be used for a wide range of studies and supports. Here, we study invertebrates on high-resolution images, but the same processing can be transferred for the study of larger animals on satellite or aircraft images."

S5 instrument objective is to monitor the composition of Earth atmosphere by taking measurements of trace gases and aerosols impacting air quality and climate, providing daily coverage of Earth atmosphere at an unprecedented resolution. SWIR-SS baseline architecture is a pushbroom imaging spectrometer with two channels, [1589 divided by 1676] nm and [2304 divided by 2386] nm, with a spectral resolution of less than 0.25 mu At the object space is located a Slit-Homogenizer, a special component which guides the optical path across the slit in order to mitigate radiometric errors arising from scene heterogeneity. Its behaviour introduces an astigmatism which is corrected at collimator level by making use of a cylindrical lens. Light is then guided towards the dispersers and is focused onto the detector by the cameras lens. Pupil anamorphism, smile and keystone due to dispersers, immersed gratings, are corrected by using a prism and combining the distortion/lateral color of collimator and focusing cameras in both optical channels. A low pass filter at the dichroic splits the wavelengths, while, for each channel, two successive coatings on front and back faces of the prisms select the band and mitigate out-of-band straylight. The design has the purpose to keep the alignment of each subsystem simple, as no aberration compensations have been foreseen between collimator and focusing camera. It shows robustness, stability vs temperature and high optical quality."

Despite the advantages of biotests performed on sentinel organisms, their wider application is limited by the nonexistence of high-throughput laboratory automation systems.

Sentinel egg cards were used to quantify mortality by parasitoids and predators at an intensively monitored location in Santa Cruz to reveal seasonality, and at other sites in Santa Cruz and San Francisco to measure spatial variation and parasitoid species composition. In addition to egg mortality, egg mass use efficiency by Trichogramma parasitoids was also examined under field conditions. The egg parasitoids primarily consisted of three Trichogramma species, T. deion, T. fasciatum and T. platneri. Previously unknown to California, T. fasciatum was shown to displace the indigenous T. platneri over a two-year period as the predominant egg parasitoid attacking LBAM egg masses. Based on the number of parasitized eggs per sentinel egg card, it is argued that individual females of at least some Trichogramma species have the capacity to oviposit more than 50 eggs in the egg mass of a host, warranting further studies to document the egg mass use efficiency and oviposition traits of other trichogrammatids under field conditions. Although egg parasitism was limited to causing elevated mortality during the summer and fall only, egg predation occurred more consistently throughout the year and is likely to be of considerable significance in suppressing LBAM populations in California. Combined with the use of a Type II survivorship curve, the importance of using a temperature-dependent physiological time scale to quantify egg mortality is illustrated when sentinel hosts are exposed to natural enemies in the field for less than the entire duration of the 'window of susceptibility' to parasitism and predation."

Then, the deformations of fast ice were detected from different incidence angles with the descending and ascending orbits data. The results showed that the deformations in radar line of sight obtained from the descending and ascending orbits data were 38cm and 37cm respectively within the fast ice region of 960km(2) in the study area. The continuous strong southwest wind was the principal reason for the deformation, and the deformation direction was dominated by east to west. Moreover, the inner fast ice kept stable and its deformation was smaller due to the protection of outer consolidated ice. The experimental results in this paper showed that the deformation trend and characteristics of fast ice can be better understood by InSAR technology with multi-orbits SAR data."

The spring streams were warm relative to nearby streams flowing from the mountains or spawning and emergence of fry was early compared with fish in mountain streams. Tams were abundant early in the summer and clinical signs of whirling disease among age-0 fish were seen as early as mid-June in one stream.

Age-0 cutthroat trout were abundant; clinical signs of whirling disease were evident, and histological evidence of whirling disease was common in the stream where tams were abundant. Low densities of age-0 cutthroat trout and no clinical signs of whirling disease were observed in the stream where tams were not abundant. Among sentinel fish in the stream with abundant tams, we found extensive occurrence of M. cerebralis, with many fish showing clinical signs and histological evidence of pathology associated with M. cerebralis.

The north component has, however, been difficult to retrieve due to the limited sensitivity of standard InSAR observations in that direction. Here, we address this problem by using time-series analysis of along-track interferometric observations in burst-overlap areas of the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scan imaging mode of the Sentinel-1 radar satellites. We apply this method to the southern part of the near-north striking Dead Sea transform fault to show that the similar to 5 mm/year relative motion is well recovered. Furthermore, the results indicate the locking depth of the fault decreases toward the south as it enters the transtensional Gulf of Aqaba basin. Our results show that time-series analysis of burst-overlap interferometric observations can be used to obtain meaningful interseismic deformation rates of slow-moving and northerly striking faults.Plain Language Summary Measurements of interseismic deformation near plate-boundary faults are used to estimate how large and how often major earthquakes are likely to occur and thus provide crucial input for regional seismic hazard assessments. Geodetic GPS data have primarily been used for this task, but increasingly Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations from satellites have provided useful information, particularly in areas where GPS observations are scarce. However, InSAR observations are only sensitive to the east and vertical components of deformation, but not to the north component, and are thus of limited use to study northerly striking earthquake faults. To address this problem, we combine an advanced processing technique called burst-overlap interferometry (BOI) with time-series analysis of a large data set to retrieve millimeter per year details of north-south deformation. We apply this method to the north-striking southern Dead Sea fault to show that the earthquake hazard decreases toward the south as the fault enters Gulf of Aqaba and approaches the Red Sea rift. Our study demonstrates that this method of BOI time-series analysis allows mapping the interseismic deformation of slow-moving and north-striking faults."

Most available algorithms typically focus on single-image techniques which do not take into account the backscatter signature of a land surface under non-flooded conditions. In this study, harmonic analysis of a multi-temporal time series of >500 ENVISAT Advanced SAR (ASAR) scenes with a spatial resolution of 150 m was used to characterise the seasonality in backscatter under non-flooded conditions. Pixels which were inundated during a large-scale flood event during the summer 2007 floods of the River Severn (United Kingdom) showed strong deviations from normal seasonal behaviour as inferred from the harmonic model. The residuals were classified by means of an automatic threshold optimisation algorithm after masking out areas which are unlikely to be flooded using a topography-derived index. The results were validated against a reference dataset derived from high-resolution airborne imagery. For the water class, accuracies > 80% were found for non-urban land uses. A slight underestimation of the reference flood extent can be seen, mostly due to the lower spatial resolution of the ASAR imagery. Finally, an outlook for the proposed algorithm is given in the light of the Sentinel-1 mission. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Body size is a decisive functional trait in many organisms, especially for phytoplankton, which span several orders of magnitude in cell volume. Therefore, the analysis of size as a functional trait driving species' performance has received wide attention in aquatic ecology, amended in recent decades by studies documenting changes in phytoplankton size in response to abiotic or biotic factors in the environment.2. We performed a systematic literature review to provide an overarching, partially quantitative synthesis of cell size as a driver and sentinel of phytoplankton ecology. We found consistent and significant allometric relationships between cell sizes and the functional performance of phytoplankton species (cellular rates of carbon fixation, respiration and exudation as well as resource affinities, uptake and content). Size scaling became weaker, absent or even negative when addressing C- or volume-specific rates or growth. C-specific photosynthesis and population growth rate peaked at intermediate cell sizes around 100 mu m(3).3. Additionally, we found a rich literature on sizes changing in response to warming, nutrients and pollutants. Whereas small cells tended to dominate under oligotrophic and warm conditions, there are a few notable exceptions, which indicates that other environmental or biotic constraints alter this general trend. Grazing seems a likely explanation, which we reviewed to understand both how size affects edibility and how size structure changes in response to grazing. Cell size also predisposes the strength and outcome of competitive interactions between algal species. Finally, we address size in a community context, where size-abundance scaling describes community composition and thereby the bio-diversity in phytoplankton assemblages.4. We conclude that (a) size is a highly predictive trait for phytoplankton metabolism at the cellular scale, with less strong and nonlinear implications for growth and specific metabolism and (b) size structure is a highly suitable sentinel of phytoplankton responses to changing environments."

We identified pixels with similar phenological behavior (i.e., pheno-clusters) and compared them to the land cover map of the study area to assess the role of the land management component in controlling the phenological patterns identified. Results demonstrated that soil texture is the most important factor for permanent crops, while large amount of rainfall and high values of available water content are the main drivers in spring cultivations (i.e., irrigated crops). Scarce water availability (in terms of soil texture, low annual precipitation and high minimum temperature) represented the main driving factor for non-irrigated crops, whose phenology is characterized by summer drought and fall-winter productivity. Compared to vegetation maps that use only land cover from a single season or period, using seasonality of the NDVI time series to classify the agricultural landscape provides different and more ecologically relevant information about croplands."

The cumulative subsidence in 4 years and 7 months exceeds 70 cm in several zones of the LGCD. The sub-centimetric precision achieved by advanced analysis (A-DInSAR), allowed us to monitor the real extent of the mining influence area on the surface, with deformation velocities of up to 50 mm/year. The ground deformation detected at LGCD can be due to both mining-induced tremors and roof subsidence above the underground excavation rooms. As deformations do not occur concurrently with tremors, this can be related to excavation activities or to degradation of abandoned mines."

Cleaning continues until the recipient ('cleanee') rejects the cleaning or the cleaner ceases cleaning. In cases where the recipient did not reject the cleaning, the cleanee often retreated to its own burrow site after the cleaner ceased cleaning, allowing the cleaner to feed on its territory. We suggest that this is mutual cooperation, in which the cleaner assists the recipient to clean the body surface, and the recipient in return provides a feeding ground for the cleaner. Using field observation, we explored the factors responsible for the retreat of the cleanee in response to the cleaning behavior. Factors influencing the retreat of the cleanee were the time of the cleaning incident relative to low tide, the cleanee's position relative to its own burrow, and the duration of the cleaning bout. The third factor showed that retreat was more common when the cleaning was thorough, which suggests that allocleaning is a form of mutual cooperation in M. banzai."

We surveyed MSFs in two forest types in and around the Important Bird Area of Chitwan National Park in Nepal, between 150 and 800 m a.s.l., to provide a first description of the composition of MSFs in this area. We also aimed to understand which species should be considered 'nuclear species', important to forming MSFs or leading them forward. Results In total, we collected records on 222 MSFs that included 100 species, and 6097 individuals. The MSFs were similar to worldwide patterns in being dominated by leaf-gleaning, non-terrestrial insectivores. However, the MSFs were more dominated by canopy species than usual, and did not have a clear gregarious, understory leading species. Rather drongos (Family Dicruridae) and minivets (Family Campephagidae, Genus Pericrocotus) acted as leaders, and a cluster analysis of composition showed one group of large body size MSFs particularly characterized by the presence of the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo (Dicrurus paradiseus). Conclusions Drongos are known to provide both costs and benefits to other flock participants: they are aggressive birds that can steal food, and manipulate other species with their vocalizations, but at the same time they are 'sentinel species' that produce information about predation risk other species can use. This study demonstrates that drongos can be considered nuclear species for some types of MSFs, despite the potential costs of their presence. MSFs led by sentinel species thus may form in Asia, as well as in the Neotropics."

The aim of the present work was to investigate the sensitivity of this enzyme to heavy metals with a view to possible future applications of CA activity inhibition measurement in biomonitoring as either an in vitro bioassay or a biomarker. CA activity was determined by modifying a previously described electrometric method: briefly, CA activity units were calculated from the rate of H+ production in the reaction mixture (where CO2 was present as a substrate) against a blank containing the specific CA inhibitor acetazolamide. As regards the possible application as an in vitro bioassay, the sensitivity to heavy metals (cadmium, mercury, and copper) of the commercially available purified carbonic anhydrase (isozyme II) from bovine erythrocyte was tested in vitro. In Our experimental set-up, bovine CA activity was significantly inhibited by micromolar concentrations of heavy metals, showing a dose-response behaviour. As regards the possible application as biomarkers, CA was investigated in the filter-feeding Mytilus galloprovincialis, widely used in pollution-monitoring programmes as a sentinel organism. Following in vitro and in vivo exposure to 1.785 mu M cadmium chloride as a reference toxicant, mantle CA activity was significant inhibited. In conclusion. the sensitivity to chemical pollutants and low cost and simplicity of the assay method make CA activity measurement suitable for in vitro bioassay of the toxicity of environmental samples and for field biomarker applications in the sentinel organism M. galloprovincialis."

Individuals were more likely to respond to alarm calls when they had received supplementary food, and hence could prioritize minimization of predation risk over starvation. There was also increased responsiveness to alarm calls given by individuals from elevated positions compared to those on the ground; sentinels (raised guards) are more likely to detect potential predators than foragers, and alarm calls from elevated positions are probably perceived as more reliable. When individuals did respond, they were more likely to flee following an alarm call given from ground level; foragers are likely to detect predators in closer proximity than sentinels, requiring more urgent escape responses. Second, we examined how individuals combine social information provided by alarm calls with personal information relating to predator presence. Receiver responses to terrestrial and aerial alarm calls did not differ when they followed interaction with an olfactory predator cue compared to an olfactory control cue. Following interaction with a terrestrial predator cue, however, latency to nonvigilance was significantly longer after hearing an aerial alarm call than after hearing a terrestrial alarm call, potentially because of social information novelty. Our results provide experimental evidence that receivers respond flexibly to alarm calls depending on receiver, signaller and external factors.

Sentinel-2 MSI TOA Level 1C reflectance images were used to remotely estimate the concentration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), the main indicator of the trophic state of aquatic environments, in five reservoirs in the state of Ceara, Brazil. A three-spectral band retrieval model was calibrated using 171 water samples, collected from November 2015 through July 2018 in 5 reservoirs. For validation, 71 additional samples, collected from August 2018 through December 2019, were used to ensure a robust accuracy assessment. The TOA Level 1C products performed very well, achieving a relative RMSE of 28% and R-2 = 0.80. Data on wind direction and speed, solar radiation and reservoir volume were used to generate a conceptual model to analyze the behavior of chl-a in the surface waters of the Castanhao reservoir. During 2019, the reservoir water quality showed strong variation, with concentration fluctuating from 30 to 95 mu g/L We showed that the end of the dry season is marked by strong eutrophic conditions corresponding to very low water inflows into the reservoir. During the rainy season there is a large decrease in the chl-a concentration following the increase of the lake water storage. During the following dry season, satellite data show a progressive improvement of the trophic state controlled by wind intensity that promotes a better mixing of the reservoir waters and inhibiting the development of most phytoplankton."

A classical biocontrol programme is under development using the egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus. Widespread implementation of biocontrol requires efficient mass rearing, which is constrained by the availability of fresh H. halys eggs. In this study, parasitism rate, developmental time, sex ratio and size were compared between wasps reared on fresh versus frozen, newly laid (<1 d old) versus variably aged (0-3 d old), and frozen egg masses stored <= 4 y. Frozen eggs yielded 56-65% fewer wasps, with parasitism rate decreasing 1-3% per month stored. Parasitism rate, sex ratio and developmental time were comparable between newly laid and variably aged eggs. Freezing eggs for any duration did not affect sex ratio or weight of emerged wasps, but delayed emergence 5-6 d. To simulate deployment of sentinel eggs in the field, we incubated frozen eggs at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C for 1-9 d before exposing them to T. japonicus, then evaluated parasitism trends. Trissolcus japonicus parasitism rate decreased 5-8% per day incubated, unhatched wasps increased 9% per day incubated and sex ratio was not impacted. Variably aged, frozen and longer stored eggs can be used for T. japonicus rearing and experimentation without affecting emerged wasp sex ratio or size within one generation, but have lower parasitism and slower development. Frozen sentinel eggs are effective <3-5 d, especially in hot conditions."

With the proposed methodology, characteristics of the river's normal average riverbed surface are determined, as well as the flood footprint. As a case study, it shows the annual and interannual water variability at the lower Coatzacoalcos Basin in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. This site was chosen after considering the evidence of seasonal flooding and the changes that happened during the 2015 to 2017 period. Our paper details the results on surface changes during this time period. The results on water surface cover have been validated through different sources of information to confirm the ability to differentiate flood areas and know the maximum flood extensions. An agreement above 92% is estimated to be reached with the use of the evaluated maps of binary water/no-water. Recurrent flood areas were detected where water remained during one or several weeks during the month of October, both in 2015 and 2017.

In semi-field studies, we evaluated adult alightment and ovipositional preference within and among raspberry plants using sentinel Tangletrap-coated and clean raspberry fruit, respectively, positioned within the exterior and interior plant canopy at four different heights (60, 85, 110 and 135 cm from the base) and conducted in field cages using sexually mature adults. Alightment of adults on Tangle-trap-coated fruit indicated a preference for fruit positioned at lower heights and/or interior locations based on significantly greater numbers being captured on sentinel sticky-coated berries at the two lowest heights. Oviposition in clean raspberry fruit also yielded a similar pattern. In mark-release-recapture studies conducted in the field, spotted wing drosophila prefer sentinel sticky fruit positioned on exterior rows as they alighted on these berries in significantly greater numbers than fruit at in the central portion of the plot. Likewise, in field trials with wild fly populations, infestations were significantly greater in edge rows compared with interior rows. Collectively, our results suggest that monitoring and behaviorally based management strategies may be more effective if they target adults foraging in the lower canopy of small fruit plants located on the crop perimeter."

Despite the potential interest of O. rudnevi as a native parasitoid, the knowledge of its biology remains very limited. We used sentinel eggs to assess the distribution of O. rudnevi in Extremadura (southwest Spain) and to explore its ecology, phenology, behavior, parasitism rates, and host preference. More than 13 500 sentinel eggs, housed in 1 030 wood disks, were field-exposed during 2016-2018 in 147 oak stands over an array of oak forests. Oobius rudnevi was the only egg parasitoid detected, being widespread and relatively abundant over the studied area (90/147 stands, 61.2%) with adults flying in May-July. Parasitoids were detected in both host species, but net parasitism (P-N) was significantly higher in C. cerdo (22.4%) than in C. welensii (9.5%). Net parasitism was affected by altitude (it was higher at 600-800 m) and tended to increase in colder aspects; P-N was poorly related to host egg density (no. eggs per disk) and unrelated to host population size (no. adults per trap). Most parasitoids overwintered and emerged in the following spring (synchronously with their hosts) but some phenotypes/lineages did not undergo obligate diapause and were bivoltine. Bivoltine wasps were spatially widespread (27/90 stands, 30%), even if their actual prevalence was rather low (60/1641 parasitized eggs, 3.7%). We also found that O. rudnevi was slightly protogynous, the sex ratio was female-biased, and the mean (+/- SEM) number of wasps emerging per parasitized egg was 9.3 +/- 0.1 (range 1-29). We discuss the potential role of O. rudnevi as a biological control agent from an evolutionary perspective."

These data were compared to mating frequencies in sentinel females placed in the field during the first three weeks of May. Under colony conditions weak illumination in the final hour of the scotophase resulted in [approximately]90% mating on the first day after eclosion; significantly greater mating compared to complete darkness throughout the scotophase, weak illumination throughout the scotophase, or weak illumination for both the first and last hour of the scotophase. In an environmental chamber programmed to simulate spring conditions, little mating occurred on the first night after eclosion and three nights were required for more than 50% of the females to mate. There was no difference in mating frequency with between moths exposed to complete darkness throughout the scotophase and those provided with weak illumination in the last half hour of the scotophase or throughout the scotophase. This delay in age of first mating was consistent with field observations with sentinel females at May in the central San Joaquin Valley. The authors conclude that, along with greater longevity and later oviposition, first mating occurs at a later age in spring conditions compared to summer conditions in this species. Planned studies of the effect of delayed mating in first and second flights will need to take these factors into account."

I quantified parameters of sociality, communication and alertness of nuclear bird species in mixed flocks with different composition. Parameters related to sociality (mean intraspecific group size) and communication (frequency of contact calls) were not correlated with the leadership. On the other hand, the most alert species was in the front of a given mixed flock most of the time. The leader species spent more time in vigilance and gave most alarm calls due to approaching raptors earlier.

New-generation SAR sensors, namely ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1, can capture surface deformation with a high coherence in wide-swath mode, thereby providing outstanding across-track displacement accuracies; however, this improvement partially sacrifices the azimuth resolution, which affects the retrieval of 3D surface deformation fields. To explore the feasibility of generating 3D deformation maps with new SAR imagery, we collect two pairs of ALOS-2 ScanSAR and four pairs of Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) images for the 12 November 2017 Ezgeleh earthquake. Furthermore, the differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR), pixel offset tracking (POT), multiple-aperture InSAR (MAI), and burst-overlap interferometry (BOI) methods are used to measure the across- and along-track displacements. Compared with the POT and MAI methods, the integration of DInSAR and BOI measurements provides high-quality 3D deformation maps with an accuracy of 4cm, which is four times and two times better than the accuracies of the POT and MAI methods integrated with DInSAR, respectively. In addition, a significant north-south displacement of 0.76m is found in our 3D deformation results that was underestimated in the slip distribution model constrained with seismic waveforms or InSAR measurements. Our 3D deformation map of the 2017 Ezgeleh earthquake indicates a southwestward horizontal motion and an upward motion without any corresponding surface rupture that effectively match the behavior of a blind rupture along a northeast-dipping reverse fault. We conclude that combining BOI with DInSAR would provide a better 3D deformation field and should be applied to study future earthquakes."

Freeze-killed sentinel egg masses of H. halys were attacked by the platygastrid Trissolcus cultratus and the eupelmid Anastatus bifasciatus, whereas fresh egg masses of native Pentatomidae occassionally yielded four Scelionidae species: Trissolcus semistriatus, T. scutellaris, T. cultratus and Telenomus chloropus. In no-choice tests, T. chloropus and T. semistratus produced no offspring from fresh H. halys eggs, whereas T. cultratus and T. scutellaris were sporadically able to complete development. Stopping embryogenesis by freezing egg masses of H. halys at -80 A degrees C enabled T. cultratus and T. semistriatus to produce a high number of offspring without influencing the behaviour of the parasitoids. In contrast to European platygastrids, the Asian parasitoids Trissolcus japonicus and T. cultratus (Chinese strain) caused significantly higher parasitism of fresh H. halys eggs. Differences in developmental success may be related to less efficient venom of European scelionids injected during oviposition.

Space-borne altimeter observations have become an important data source to supplement in-situ measurements of water levels. The applications of satellite radar altimetry in monitoring reservoirs at global or regional scales have been well demonstrated in many previous studies. However, studies on medium- and small-sized reservoirs are limited due to the coarser footprints and relatively low vertical accuracy. In anticipation of new satellite laser altimetry missions, we aim to demonstrate the coverage performance of ICESat-2 for global reservoirs and to further explore its application potential in monitoring the long-term changes in water level and storage of reservoirs by integrating Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery datasets. In the first 18 months of the ICESat-2 mission, we find that ICESat-2 observations can cover 6231 out of 7250 reservoirs worldwide inventoried in the GRanD database with a size ranging from 0.1 km(2) to 67166.2 km(2), which accounts for nearly 86% in count and about 99% in area and capacity for the whole of GRanD-inventoried reservoir. We then select 40 reservoirs of different sizes and shapes located in different continents to establish the hypsometric curves. Most of these reservoirs show robust fitting in the hypsometric curves, with the R-2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.99 and the RMSE values from 0.37 m to 1.01 m. As a new global satellite altimetry dataset, ICESat-2 shows excellent potential in reconstructing long-term water levels with the hypsometric curve method for various reservoirs. We also find that the ICESat-2 ATL13 product misses a small proportion of reservoirs for various reasons, including their small size, latitudinal narrow shape, and data inconsistency between the HydroLAKES as water mask of the ICESat-2 ATL13 product and the updated GRanD data sets. With the continued observation of ICESat-2 and possibly updated inland water body mask for the ATL13 product in the future, many reservoirs can be routinely monitored with high accuracy. Our findings confirm the powerful capacity of ICESat-2 and are expected to enhance our understanding of reservoir behavior in global hydrological processes and water resource management."

We use the 2017-2018 crisis at Agung volcano as a case example because strong atmospheric signals were originally misidentified as true deformation, and obscured the subtle deformation pattern associated with magmatic activity. We assess the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) of each method and found the average area under the ROC curve to be about 0.5 for the uncorrected data (corresponding to no discrimination capability), around 0.8 after combined atmospheric corrections (weather model and phase elevation approaches), and more than 0.95 using a cumulative sum control chart (where 1 corresponds to ideal separation between classes). Our results retrospectively show that uplift could have been detected to a 95% level of confidence for both ascending and descending time series by October 2017, 15 days after the start of the seismic swarm and 1 month prior to the eruption. Thus, our approach successfully flags anomalous behavior without relying on visual inspection or selection of an arbitrary threshold, and hence shows potential as a monitoring tool for volcano observatories globally."

A new time-saving colony examination method, including the use of an internal divider reduced the time needed for hive inspections by 31.86 % on average. Prioritizating the inspection of pollen and honey combs rather than brood combs is advised. Sentinel apiaries with no more than five colonies without supers are suggested for each beekeeping location in order to attract and to monitor the early appearance of SHB.

Brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys and bagrada bug, Bagrada hilaris, two exotic stink bugs new to California, are now widely distributed throughout the state. A survey was conducted to identify resident natural enemies of their eggs. A field camera aided in the identification of arthropods attacking these eggs and their relative impact. Predation of BMSB eggs, which are naturally oviposited onto plant foliage, was less than for eggs of bagrada bug, which oviposit onto and into soil. The top ranked predators of BMSB eggs were the carabid Laemostenus complanatus (Coleoptera) the European earwig Forficula auricularia and ring-legged earwig Euborellia annulipes (Dermaptera), the oriental cockroach Blatta orientalis (Orthoptera), and the spider Trachelas spp. (Araneae). The two most common and important predators of bagrada bug were two ant species (Formicidae), Solenopsis xyloni and Monomorium ergatogyna, and species of Collembola (Entomobryidae). A Predation Index was developed to compare the relative importance of BMSB egg predators. Lastly, two striking, unanticipated results are reported: an apparent synergistic interaction between the spider Trachelas spp. and native ant M. ergatogyna in causing damage to sentinel eggs of BMSB, and the predaceous role for Collembola on bagrada bug sentinel eggs."

The flight call is equivalent to the functional song and contains the species-specific recognition code. Flight calls may also be uttered when perched and, when in quick series, function as long-range alarm calls. Long-range alarm calls become a high intensity congregation signal when several individuals overlap and, despite degradation and attenuation, may contain the species-specific code over distances of 800 m. The average (+/- SD) feeding flock size was 7.7 +/- 8.2 individuals (n = 116) while the roosting flock size was 79.1 +/- 10.5 individuals (n = 7). Short-range calls maintain communication while minimizing detection.

Recently O. gonoceri emerged from sentinel egg batches of Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera Pentatomidae) in central Italy. Due to the scanty data on this species, biological and demographic parameters of O. gonoceri were investigated under laboratory conditions on the alternative host Graphosoma italicum italicum (Muller) (Hemiptera Pentatomidae). Estimated fecundity was over 200 eggs/female and the mean progeny production per female was high (173.76 specimens). At the standard rearing condition (26 degrees C) the development time of both sexes was similar and adults emerged after two weeks. Moreover O. gonoceri females lived much longer than males and the host feeding behaviour resulted irrelevant for the parasitoid longevity. The main biological parameters of O. gonoceri were similar to those reported for other cogeneric species. However, this species appeared to be a very effective egg parasitoid if compared with Ooencyrtus telenomicida (Vassiliev) reared on the same host."

When investigating animal presence, however, few detections will suffice to establish an animal's presence within a certain time frame. In this study, we assess detection range and its impacting factors with a novel approach aimed towards studies making use of binary presence/absence metrics. The probability of determining presence of an acoustic transmitter within a certain time frame is calculated as the probability of detecting a set minimum number of transmissions within that time frame. We illustrate this method for hourly and daily time bins with an extensive empirical dataset of sentinel transmissions and detections in a receiver array in a Belgian offshore wind farm. Results The accuracy and specificity of over 84% for both temporal resolutions showed the developed approach performs adequately. Using this approach, we found important differences in the predictive performance of distinct hypothetical range testing scenarios. Finally, our results demonstrated that the probability of determining presence over distance to a receiver did not solely depend on environmental and technical conditions, but would also relate to the temporal resolution of the analysis, the programmed transmitting interval and the movement behaviour of the tagged animal. The probability of determining presence differed distinctly from a single transmission's detectability, with an increase of up to 266 m for the estimated distance at 50% detection probability (D-50). Conclusion When few detections of multiple transmissions suffice to ascertain presence within a time bin, predicted range differs distinctly from the probability of detecting a single transmission within that time bin. We recommend the use of more rigorous range testing methodologies for acoustic telemetry applications where the assessment of detection range is an integral part of the study design, the data analysis and the interpretation of results."

We collected tissue samples for genetic analyses on five breeding colonies in the western Pacific Ocean (Japan) and on 13 colonies in the eastern Pacific Ocean (California to Alaska), and deployed light-level geolocator tags on 12 eastern Pacific colonies to delineate wintering areas. Geolocator tags were deployed previously on one colony in Japan. There was strong genetic differentiation between populations in the eastern vs. western Pacific Ocean, likely due to two factors. First, glaciation over the North Pacific in the late Pleistocene might have forced a southward range shift that historically isolated the eastern and western populations. And second, deep-ocean habitat along the northern continental shelf appears to act as a barrier to movement; abundant on both sides of the North Pacific, the rhinoceros auklet is virtually absent as a breeder in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, and no tagged birds crossed the North Pacific in the non-breeding season. While genetic differentiation was strongest between the eastern vs. western Pacific, there was also extensive differentiation within both regional groups. In pairwise comparisons among the eastern Pacific colonies, the standardized measure of genetic differentiation (F?ST) was negatively correlated with the extent of spatial overlap in wintering areas. That result supports the hypothesis that segregation in the non-breeding season is linked to genetic structure. Philopatry and a neritic foraging habit probably also contribute to the structuring. Widely distributed, vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors, and exhibiting extensive genetic structure, the rhinoceros auklet is fully indicative of the scope of the conservation challenges posed by seabirds."

We estimate 42 cm of maximum subsidence during the period of interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations, and a maximum of 1 m or more subsidence, since the end of the construction phase of the reclamation project. A hyperbolic model was used to relate the three independent time series and to estimate the nonlinear behavior of subsidence. The model estimates a maximum subsidence rate and acceleration of -5.7 cm/year and 1.1 cm/year(2), respectively. The decomposition of vertical and east-west horizontal motion using the Sentinel-1 dataset indicates relatively weak partial horizontal displacement as well as substantial vertical deformation overall. The long-term time series analysis indicates ongoing ground subsidence, although almost two decades have passed since the completion of reclamation.Plain Language Summary Ground subsidence is a process that may threaten human lives and property, and it often occurs owing to the compaction of alluvial sediments as a result of groundwater extraction or soil consolidation. In particular, coastal reclaimed land composed of soft materials such as sand or soil, rather than massive rock, is vulnerable to subsidence. We used three data sets comprising interferometric radar images from two satellites to monitor ground subsidence over time in Busan, South Korea, from 2007 to 2019. We noted not only vertical surface displacement in the overall area, which was expected, but also local displacement in the horizontal direction in specific areas. A hyperbolic model was used to estimate the vertical movement over time due to subsidence, instead of a constant subsidence model. The model results indicate ongoing ground subsidence in the study area, although almost 20 years have passed since the completion of reclamation."

Abnormalities of the nucleus shape, swollen cells, lipid droplet deposition, and an increase in vacuolation on the affected gills were observed with the degree of damage associated with CuSO4 exposure concentration. CuSO4 exposure in O. mossambicus also gave various patterns of inhibitory effects on cholinesterase (ChE) depending on the concentration of exposure and the organs exposed. Copper exposure altered ChE activity extracted from the gills of O. mossambicus with 99.9% of inhibition at the highest exposure concentration of CuSO4 (20mg/L).

Only two birds, probably sub-adults, showed extensive movement patterns before their death. Individuals overlapped their home ranges extensively (from 30 98% with 2-3 tagged individuals), but these values were probably higher because a small proportion of the population was tagged.

Our results show that epaulet size has a small positive effect on male reproductive success, but epaulet color has no effect on male-male competition, female choice, and male reproductive success. One explanation for the seeming contradiction between studies that show that epaulets are necessary for territory defense and those that conclude that epaulets are not currently under selection is that epaulets serve as one of several cues of species recognition, especially among males at close range. An alternative explanation proposes counter-balancing intersexual advantages and intrasexual disadvantages of epaulet expression. Additional studies are needed to test these alternatives."

A diverse community of predatory arthropods has been described in turfgrass, contributing to the direct mortality of pests including black cutworm, fall armyworm, and Japanese beetle. Billbugs are a major pest of turfgrass in the Intermountain West, but the composition of the local predatory arthropod community and whether predators aid in billbug suppression through consumptive or non-consumptive effects is unknown. First, we catalogued the predatory arthropod community on Utah and Idaho golf courses using linear pitfall traps. Then, we assessed adult billbug consumption by resident predators in the field. Using a series of lab assays, we assessed the most abundant predators' consumption of billbug life stages, including adults, sentinel waxworm larvae at varied soil depths, and eggs in turf stems. Finally, we assessed the non-consumptive effects of these abundant predators on adult billbug activity (mating, oviposition, thanatosis). We found that the predatory arthropod community consisted primarily of carabids (Pterostichus melanarius, Harpalus sp., Amara aenea, and Anisodactylus sp.) and spiders (lycosids), representing 60% and 28% of all predators, respectively. In the field and in lab assays, adult billbug mortality from predation was generally low at < 6%. While predators readily consumed sentinel larvae in petri dish arenas, larvae escaped predation at 1 cm soil depth. The greatest consumptive effects of predators were on billbug eggs, with Anisodactlylus sp. feeding on 46% of eggs. Predator exposure reduced overall billbug activity by 56%, and for hunting billbugs, specifically, reduced mating activity by 28%. Our new understanding of the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators on billbugs supports the importance of conservation biocontrol in turfgrass and assists in planning for enhancement of specific predators."

Broods combined only when they were hatched from nearby nests. Communal brood rearing may be constrained by the absence of pre-hatch contact between the parents, or by the limited mobility of young chicks."

Such an experiment is also supplemental to the smart city concept as it can help to identify whether there is a delay on air quality improvement during or after a sharp decline on traffic and to determine what, if any, factors are contributing to that time lag. As such, this study investigates the immediate impacts of COVID-19 causing abrupt declines on traffic and NO2 concentration in all Florida Counties through March 2020. Daily tropospheric NO2 concentrations were extracted from the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and vehicle mile traveled (VMT) estimates were acquired from cell phone mobility records. It is observed that overall impacts of the COVID-19 response in Florida have started in the first half of the March 2020, two weeks earlier than the official stay-at-home orders, and resulted in 54.07% and 59.68% decrease by the end of the month on NO2 and VMT, respectively. Further, a cross-correlation based dependency analysis was conducted to analyze the similarities and associated time lag between 7-day moving averages of VMT and NO2 concentrations of the 67 counties. Although such reduction is unprecedented for both data sets, results indicate a strong correlation and this correlation increases with the identification of a time lag between VMT and NO2 concentration. Majority of the counties have no time lag between VMT and NO2 concentration; however, a cluster of South Florida counties presents earlier decrease on NO2 concentration compare to VMT, which indicates that the air quality improvements in those counties are not traffic related. Investigation on the socioeconomic factors indicates that population density and income level have no significant impact on the time lag between traffic and air quality improvements in light of COVID-19."

These dredging operations facilitate the elimination of sediments that the coastal dynamics introduce. Dredging operations are increasingly restrictive and costly due to environmental requirements. Understanding the condition of the seabed before and after dredging is essential. In addition, determining how the seabed has behaved in recent years is important to consider when planning future dredging operations. In order to analyze the behavior of sediment transport and the changes to the seabed due to sedimentation, studies of littoral dynamics are conducted to model the deposition of sediments. Another methodology that could be used to analyze the real behavior of sediments would be to study and compare port bathymetries collected periodically. The problem with this methodology is that it requires numerous bathymetric surveys to produce a sufficiently significant analysis. This study provides an effective solution for obtaining a dense time series of bathymetry mapping using satellite data, and enables the past behavior of the seabed to be examined. The methodology proposed in this work uses Sentinel-2A (10 m resolution) satellite images to obtain historical bathymetric series by the development of a random forest algorithm. From these historical bathymetric series, it is possible to determine how the seabed has behaved and how the entry of sediments into the study area occurs. This methodology is applied in the Port of Luarca (Principality of Asturias), obtaining satellite images and extracting successive bathymetry mapping utilizing the random forest algorithm. This work reveals how once the dock was dredged, the sediments were redeposited and the seabed recovered its level prior to dredging in less than 2 months."

This insect-induced root volatile attracts entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) and thereby helps to protect the roots against herbivore damage. Previous studies suggest that diffusion of E beta c occurs through the gaseous rather than the aqueous phase in sand and its diffusion is best at low levels of humidity. However, it remains largely unknown how E beta c diffuses in typical natural and agricultural soils. To fully understand the function and efficiency of root-produced E beta c as a belowground signal it is important to know how it spreads in real soils and how soil properties affect its diffusion. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses, the diffusion of two doses of synthetic E beta c (200 ng and 20,000 ng) injected in sand was compared with the diffusion of E beta c injected in clay, clay-loam and sandy-loam soils, at 3 moisture levels (5, 10 and 20% water), and at two distances (5 and 10 cm) from the E beta c injection point. The diffusion of the compound was measured with a Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) fiber every 30 minutes over a period of 9 hours. We found that, in contrast to the pattern observed for pure sand, E beta c diffused best when humidity was high in the three agricultural soils. In subsequent experiments we used glass-trays to create two types of mesocosms to assess the effect of synthetic or root-produced E beta c on the dispersal of the EPN Heterorhabditis megidis and its infection of sentinel hosts in the trays. The presence of synthetic E beta c did not affect the ability of H. megidis to infect the sentinel host. However, under the test conditions, E beta c released from maize roots influenced the migration behaviour of H. megidis depending on soil type. The results suggest that D. virgifera-damaged maize plants may recruit H. megidis more efficiently in clay loam soils than in other types of soil. These new insights into the diffusion dynamics and attraction efficiency of the root-produced signal E beta c may help efforts to develop novel strategies for the sustainable management of the maize pest D. virgifera."

As upper trophic species, baleen whales can serve as sentinels of ecosystem reorganization in response to these biophysical alterations, via changes in their ecology and physiological condition. This paper is the first to review baleen whale ecology in high-latitude marine ecosystems of both the north Atlantic and north Pacific. Oceanographically, these sectors offer four contrasting habitats to baleen whales: (i) a broad-deep-strait and deep-shelf inflow system in the Northeast Atlantic (NEA), (ii) a combination of inflow and outflow systems north of Iceland in the central North Atlantic (CNA), (iii) an outflow shelf and basin in the Northwest Atlantic (NWA), and (iv) a narrow-shallow-strait inflow shelf system in the Pacific sector. Information on baleen whale ecology from visual and passive acoustic surveys, combined with available telemetry and diet studies, show contrasting patterns of baleen whale occurrence among sectors. In brief, arctic and subarctic waters in the Atlantic sector support a far greater number of seasonally-migrant baleen whales than the Pacific sector. Thousands of humpback, fin and common minke whales occupy the diverse habitats of the Atlantic sector. These species all exhibit flexible diets, focused primarily on euphausiids (krill) and forage fishes (e.g., capelin, herring, sand lance), which are now responding to ecosystems altered by climate change. Conversely, the Pacific sector supports a far greater number of arctic-endemic bowhead whales than the Atlantic sector, as well as a large population of seasonally-migrant gray whales. Currently, differences in migratory timing and, to a lesser extent, foraging behaviors, serves to restrict prey competition between the arctic-endemic bowhead whale and seasonally migrant baleen whale species in both sectors. Regional aspects of changes in prey type and availability will likely impact future migratory timing, habitat selection, body condition and diet of baleen whales. Tracking variability in these attributes can provide valuable input to ecosystem models and thereby contribute the sentinel capability of baleen whales to forecasts of future states of high latitude marine ecosystems."

The synergism of 2-undecanone with other attractants is comparable to that one described for lactic acid. The combination of 2- undecanone with lactic acid, however, was more attractive than the two compounds as single stimuli. Interestingly 2-undecanone is neither known as an human skin compound nor as a volatile in human breath. First field experiments near Regensburg in Germany with BG-Sentinel[registered trademark] mosquito traps could not confirm the attractive effect of 2-undecanone (ROSE et al. 2006) for Culex species.

The increase of long-term drought periods and the trend towards low summer precipitation totals trigger an increase in groundwater scarcity and amplify the negative effects of extensive irrigation purposes and freshwater consumption in a hydrologically sensitive region in Central Europe. This article presents qualitative transnational open source remote sensing temporal series of vegetation indices (NDVI) and groundwater level development to tracing near real-time vegetation change and socio-ecological feedbacks during periods of climate extremes in the Upper Rhine Area (2018-2020). Increased freshwater consumption caused a dramatic drop in groundwater availability, which eventually led to a strong degradation of the vegetation canopy and caused governmental regulations in July 2020. Assessing vegetation growth behavior and linking groundwater reactions in the URA through open source satellite data contributes to a rapidly accessible understanding of the ecosystem's feedbacks on the local to the transnational scale and further enables risk management and eco-political regulations in current and future decision-making processes."

In this study, we are going to model and predict the future behavior of land subsidence by InSAR processing and leveraging deep learning methods over the lands in the vicinity of Lake Urmia (located in the northwest of Iran). Accordingly, Sentinel-1 data over 56 months from November 2014 to June 2019 and small baseline subsets (SBAS) InSAR methods were utilized. Several regions with a high rate of subsidence were identified (maximum monthly subsidence of 13.3 mm). Furthermore, environmental factors affecting subsidence were considered. Therefore, parameters such as rainfall, groundwater, and lake area variations were measured using TRMM, GRACE, and MODIS satellite data, respectively. In order to determine and assess the relation between land deformations and environmental variations, several machine learning methods were implemented. The environmental parameters were used as the input of models and ground deformations as the target to be predicted. Eventually, ground deformations were estimated using multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, in which each network had strengths and weaknesses on different occasions. Thus, by blending the forecast of the three models, a weighted ensemble was constructed, which outperformed the single models and reached the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation (SD) of 8.2 mm, 6.4 mm, and +/- 5.2 mm, respectively. The result indicated that although each single model had proper accuracy, an ensemble model can improve land deformation anticipation using the strength of networks in various conditions."

However, for many species, we do not have a good understanding of the range of GC concentrations that might indicate a compromised individual. A temporary increase in GC concentration can prompt the adoption of behavior or activities to promote individual survival. However, chronic GC elevation results in deleterious effects on health that can reduce survival. In order to use GC concentration as a metric of individual fitness for a given species, it will be necessary to relate individual demographic rates to GC concentration. We related survival in American pikas (Ochotona princeps) to 2 different stress metrics, glucocorticoid metabolite (GCM) concentration in fecal samples and GC concentration in plasma samples. Annual survival was analyzed in relation to each of these stress metrics as well as other physiological metrics and habitat characteristics at several sites in the Rocky Mountains. Among the predictors considered, GCM concentration was by far the strongest predictor of annual survival in pikas, and individuals with higher baseline GCM were less likely to survive. Our metric of flea load was also negatively related to annual survival. Given the limited time and resources that characterize many wildlife conservation projects, it is important to establish which endocrine metrics are the most informative for a species. American pikas have been identified as a sentinel species for detecting effects of climate change, and several correlational studies have projected range contraction for the species. Our results suggest that more mechanistic projections might be possible given further study of the relationship between GCM and climate. Our approach contributes to a better understanding of factors affecting survival in this species and provides a basis for further research relating individual stress response and survival to environmental change."

Stock status was updated based upon information collected up to spring 2015. Principal sources of information available for the assessment were: a time series of abundance and biomass indices from Canadian winter/spring research vessel (RV) bottom trawl surveys, inshore sentinel surveys, science logbooks from vessels < 35 ft., logbooks from vessels > 35 ft., reported landings from commercial fisheries, oceanographic data, and tagging studies. Total landings for the 2014-15 management year (April 1-March 31) were 7,166 t or just 54% of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC), and this marks the sixth consecutive season that the TAC has not been fully taken. The 2015-16 fishery was still in progress at the time of the meeting. The removals through recreational fishing are unknown since 2007, but based on previous estimates are thought to be a small fraction ([approximately] 1%) of the commercial landings. Estimates of abundance and biomass from the DFO RV spring survey have been relatively stable over the past seven years (except for a high value in 2013 apparently influenced by a year-effect), with abundance being slightly higher than it was in the early 2000s and biomass being generally lower than it was in the early 2000s. The 2015 survey was dominated by young fish which are not yet of commercial size. Sentinel gillnet catch rates have been very low and stable since 1999. Sentinel linetrawl catch rates have been below average for the past six years and the 2014 catch rate was the lowest in the time series. Gillnet catch rates from logbooks of vessels < 35 ft. have been generally stable since 1999 but increasing to slightly above average in 2014. Linetrawl catch-rates decreased over 2006-10, but subsequently increased and are presently at the time-series average. Estimates of Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) derived from a survey-based (SURBA) cohort model increased considerably over 2009-12 but have since declined. The 2014 and 2015 estimates are approximately 1.4 times higher than the limit reference point (LRP), and the stock is currently in the 'cautious zone' according to DFO's Precautionary Approach (PA) Framework.. The probability of being below the LRP in 2015 is low ([approximately]0.05). Recruitment has improved over the last decade with most cohorts at or above the time-series (1983-2014) average. In particular, indications are that the 2011 and 2012 cohorts are strong. Estimated total mortality has generally been increasing since 1997 to near the time-series maximum. Over 2012-14, it averaged 0.65 (48% annual mortality), which is high especially considering that reported landings have been about half of the TACs over this time period. Projection of the stock to 2016 was conducted assuming mortality rates will be within [plus or minus]20% of current values (2012-14 average). Projection scenarios indicate that the 2016 SSB will increase from the 2015 estimate, with median 2016 relative SSB projections ranging from 1.7 to 2.1. In each of the scenarios, the probability of being below the LRP in 2016 is low (<= 0.05). Despite short-term projections for stock growth, there is reason for concern for 3Ps cod going forward. Although recruitment has recently been good, mortality is very high and hence the long-term contribution of these year classes to the fishery and spawning biomass is still uncertain. The spawning biomass is composed almost entirely of young fish, with the current age at maturity being the lowest recorded in the time series. Recent biological data suggest fish growth rates are low and that fish condition is poor. In recent years, cod in 3Ps have been feeding heavily on lipid-poor prey such as snow crab and other invertebrates. The combination of these biological data with the recent rise of warm-water species such as white hake is suggestive of broad changes in the 3Ps ecosystem and perhaps reduced cod productivity."

The nonoverlapping, three-dimensional territories in the canopy had a ground size up to 0.8 ha. C. gigas showed a distinct territorial behavior: (1) specific barrack nests, especially containing many majors, were situated at the borders and were established during long-term territorial conflicts; (2) trunk trails were regularly patrolled by majors that attacked alien conspecifics and some other ant species violently; and (3) sentinels, often involved in long-enduring conflicts with neighboring ant colonies, defended the borders at bridgeheads. Interspecific conflicts with sympatric Camponotus, species always led to violent, bloody fights of all castes. Intraspecific conflicts, however, were solved by ritual fights (front leg boxing) of majors. C gigas performed a de-escalation strategy to end short periods of true intraspecific ant war that we provoked experimentally.

The island of Totogochillo is a lava formed island with vegetation type consisting of secondary tropical rain forest. The stumptail group composition consisted of 1 adult male, 5 adult female and 14 non adult individuals. Individuals and matrilineal genealogies are identifiable. Home range is limited by the island's size. The macaques only have 1 sleeping site. The use of resting areas seems to be related to variations in the travelling and foraging patterns of the stumptails. Five travelling routes were identified and changes in these are associated with changes in the availability and distribution of natural edibles. Feeding adaptations consist of consumption of vegetal matter such as leaves, seeds, roots, flowers and tree bark. Of 65 major plant species identified, the stumptails consume 28% (N:18). Sex differences in foods eaten were not observed but age differences do exist. The macaques prey on crickets, spiders, birds and water snails. Food pressure is suggested to induce the monkeys to locate new food resources. Predators on the island are not existent but avian predators are present in the area. The stumptails respond to their presence with alarm calls and an attack by a hawk on the group was witnessed. Sentinel behavior was performed by an adult female while protecting and scouting was carried out by the adult male. During the course of the study 4 deaths occurred, 2 infants were born and on Nov. 7th, 12 more stumptails were released on the island.

Companion cropping strategies have been developed to augment densities of C. maculata in sweet corn plantings. In this study, the importance of predation by C. maculata larvae was evaluated in experiments when larval abundance was manipulated using hand removal and physical exclusion. In 2003 and 2004, sentinel H. zea eggs were exposed on corn for 48 h. Egg mortality was 13.8% greater in the treatment where C. maculata larvae were present. In 2004 and 2005 eggs were exposed on corn under the same hand removal and physical exclusion techniques and monitored at 3-h intervals for 24 h to directly observe predation on sentinel eggs. Coleomegilla maculata larvae were the most frequently observed predators of the eggs, accounting for 45.9% of 85 total observed predation events in the control. Whereas in the treatment where C. maculata larvae were reduced, egg survival was 26.13% greater and only 37 total predation events were observed. All pest eggs were eliminated from individual ears 22.1% more often when C. maculata larvae were present at natural densities indicating that predation by this predator stage lessens crop damage by H. zea.

Due to the climate changes and industrial development, soil resources in these zones are prone to degradation. On the other hand, degradation processes cause changes in land cover. Remote sensing optical data are widely used in the process of determining land cover change whereas SAR data is suitable for determination of soil moisture dynamics. In the present study, Tasseled Cap Transform (TCT) and modified Change Vector Analysis (mCVA) techniques are applied to Landsat and Sentinel 2 data in order to be determined magnitude and direction of land cover changes in the semi-natural areas of Haskovo Region, Southeast Bulgaria. The study of the vector direction presents some distinct changes in the soil characteristics for the whole territory and significant changes in vegetation characteristics and moisture content in part of the semi-mountainous territories of the examined region. It has been found that the magnitude of those changes increases up to 50% in some of the territories under investigation. SAR data has been used to evaluate the relative soil moisture content in various soil differences and to trace its dynamics during growing season. In order to achieve this aim, Relative Soil Moisture Index (RSMI) is used. The index estimates the relative variation of volumetric soil moisture content in a given time period and enables determination of its change in relative values. On the basis of integrated application of aforementioned techniques, a model providing key information about the impact of soil moisture change and dynamics upon processes related to land cover change. The suggested model is appropriate for estimation of ecosystem services and functions delivered by landscapes in semi-arid and dry sub-humid zones."

Since Harcourt's study, climate change, urbanisation, and crop diversity may have altered the population dynamics of both the diamondback moth and its natural enemy community in the original study area. To follow up on Harcourt's work, we used two approaches to build life tables to describe mortality factors in the field and the natural enemies attacking diamondback moth in Ottawa: destructive sampling of mature cabbage, Brassica oleracea Linnaeus (Brassicaceae), plants similar to Harcourt's approach and a modern sentinel-based approach with an enemy exclusion cage treatment. After 65 years, the primary parasitoids attacking diamondback moth remained the same, although more parasitoid diversity was revealed by the destructive sampling technique. Total mortality and parasitism levels also remained similar. In one notable difference, we attributed more diamondback mortality to predation.

Mukhametov (1987) and Supin et al. (1978) found no physiological correlation between the active brain hemisphere and the open eye, and suggested that no sentinel function exists. I describe the behavioral and social aspects of sleep in a captive school of four Pacific white-sided dolphins (La genorhynchus obliquidens) at Long Marine Lab at the University of California at Santa Cruz for 32 nights. As the animals swam in formation, I recorded their positions and eye condition. Dolphins did not close their eyes or switch positions in the school randomly. While in formation, dolphins switched positions in bouts while concurrently changing eye condition. This resulted in a sleeping formation in which the dolphins likely had the eye open towards schoolmates, not toward the external environment. I suggest that this allows sleep to proceed while allowing dolphins to maintain visual contact with group members."

Eucalyptus is the most common exotic species in Portugal forests. This species is fundamental in the industries related to the pulp paper production and the concern about their effects in ecosystems is growing. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) combined with Remote Sensing (RS) data can help to understand this complex ecosystem. Moreover, GIS and RS are commonly used in forest management. GIS allows the manipulation, analysis, and generation of considerable amounts of environmental information. This information can be used in the evaluation of ecosystems' conditions and for decision making. The study case of this project was the municipal lands included in Serras do Porto and Valongo's Nature 2000 network (Porto district, Portugal). The study zone considered in this work is a landscape of extreme relevance to Porto Metropolitan Area. For decades this area was extensively explored with eucalyptus plantations in order to produce cellulose for paper industry. Due to the characteristics of the area and its extension (40 hectares) the use of GIS became the most accurate and reliable alternative to characterize it. The combination of GIS tools and RS data allows the characterization of terrain relief, namely the analysis of altimetry, hypsometry, hydrography, the creation of environmental indexes such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). RS technology offer the potential to explore the effects of land-use changes and disturbances on forest dynamics at large spatial scales. A Sentinel-2A image was used to produce NDVI, EVI, and NDWI environmental indexes and to generate the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) map, through Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin from QGIS software using Minimum Distance algorithm. The LULC was classified with two classes because the study area only presents two types of species: eucalyptus and bare soil. The LULC map obtained was validated through field points collected in the study area with a GPS receptor. An overall accuracy of 92.98% and a kappa statistic of 0.842 was obtained. Also, some of the geographic information obtained in the field was then integrated in QGIS software. Moreover, a phenological study was performed using NDVI values obtained from Sentinel-2A images, to understand the eucalyptus behavior in a certain period of time.. Because of that RS data provided useful information about the landscape dynamics allowing the assess to forest cover change and land use helping to create decision making plans and forest conservation measures."

In contrast, behavioral ecologists seek to understand the adaptive function of cooperative behavior of animals in the wild but typically neglect the underlying psychological mechanisms. Here we appraise and integrate evidence from these two approaches to understand the potential cognitive solutions to four fundamental challenges that animals face during cooperative interactions under natural conditions: (1) when to cooperate; (2) with whom to cooperate; (3) what to do in cooperative interactions; (4) how much to contribute to cooperation. We argue that an ecologically motivated approach is critical to understanding the psychological mechanisms of cooperation and how these mechanisms evolve."

Behavioral responses such as changes in swimming patterns of small aquatic invertebrates are emerging as sensitive endpoints to monitor aquatic pollution. Although behavioral responses do not deliver information on an exact type or the intensity of toxicants present in water samples, they could provide orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than lethal endpoints such as mortality. Despite the advantages of behavioral biotests performed on sentinel organisms, their wider application in real-time and near realtime biomonitoring of water quality is limited by the lack of dedicated and automated video-microscopy systems. Current behavioral analysis systems rely mostly on static test conditions and manual procedures that are time-consuming and labor intensive. Tracking and precise quantification of locomotory activities of multiple small aquatic organisms requires high-resolution optical data recording. This is often problematic due to small size of fast moving animals and limitations of culture vessels that are not specially designed for video data recording. In this work, we capitalized on recent advances in miniaturized CMOS cameras, high resolution optics and biomicrofluidic technologies to develop near real-time water quality sensing using locomotory activities of small marine invertebrates. We present proof-of-concept integration of high-resolution time-resolved video recording system and high-throughput miniaturized perfusion biomicrofluidic platform for optical tracking of nauplii of marine crustacean Artemia franciscana. Preliminary data demonstrate that Artemia sp. exhibits rapid alterations of swimming patterns in response to toxicant exposure.

Population trends are impossible to quantify due to this species' remote breeding range, low breeding densities and erratic distribution and numbers during winter irruptions in inhabited areas. Mortality due to incidental trapping and shooting is unknown, but its diurnal habits and lack of fear of humans make it vulnerable to persecution. More than 50% of the hawk owl's breeding range occurs in northern forests that are currently noncommercial. Until recently, the majority of the hawk owl's breeding range was unaffected by forestry practices. In the last 20 yr, forestry activities have expanded in commercial northern forests. Modification of clear-cut logging practices have the potential to enhance hawk owl habitat. Variable-sized cuts of <100 ha, interspersed with forest patches and staggered over time, are thought to be optimal. If cuts contain suitable numbers of stumps, snags and trees for hunting perches and nest sites, they will offer year-round habitat. Other factors, such as cut shape and juxtaposition, are probably less important to this striking sentinel of our northernmost forests."

It is also among the major causes of ice dams and glacier lake floods. Previous studies have shown that in the West Kunlun Mountains) (WKM) where a cluster of surge-type glaciers had been found, the glaciers were relatively stable in recent years. Nevertheless, the surge cycle and its impact on glacier changes on a regional scale are poorly understood. In this study, we updated the surge-type glacier inventory of the WKM using the detailed changes in glacier length, surface velocity, and surface elevation during the 1972-2020 period using 78 Landsat optical images, 86 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and three digital elevation models of the WKM. The updated results show that among the 423 glaciers in the WKM, 10 are confirmed as surge-type glaciers, three are likely surge-type glaciers, and five are possible surge-type glaciers. Furthermore, these 18 glaciers account for 63% of the total glacier area. During the period analyzed, there were marked changes in the lengths, areas and surface elevations of all surge-type glaciers, while those of the non-surge-type glaciers were relatively stable. These results appear to indicate that the observed regional trends of glaciers in the WKM recently may be related to the existence of surge-type glaciers. Furthermore, the surge-type glacier underwent advance after accelerating for 3-4 years, which could be used to forecast when glacier termini may advance and avoid the possible catastrophic damages.Plain Language Summary Glacier surging is a form of irregular motion of a glacier, which rapidly transports a volume of ice, followed by a longer slowdown period. In this study, we employed a vast archive of optical and synthetic aperture radar satellite images to monitor the glaciers change in the West Kunlun Mountains (WKM). The results revealed the existence of 18 surge-type glaciers (10 confirmed, 3 likely, and 5 possible) which accounted for 63% of the total area in the WKM. Furthermore, non-surge-type glaciers experienced little changes in recent decades, while surge-type glaciers showed large ice loss. The existence of surge-type glaciers may affect the assessment of glacier change in this region."

In an area with two available habitats, Zostera seagrass beds and unvegetated sand flats, males occurred almost exclusively in seagrass, whereas the females occurred at equal densities in both habitats. Estimates of intake rates seemed greater for individuals foraging in seagrass (0.114-0.128 g dry mass (DM)(.)min(-1)) than on sand (0.064-0.087 g DM.min(-1)). Males appeared less well adapted for foraging on sand than in seagrass, and the presence of females could interfere with males' foraging on sand. The reason for the equal distribution of the females between the habitats probably lies in the inability of one particular habitat to support the entire population of females. Little interhabitat movement by individuals was detected. Within a habitat, sexes moved synchronously at the 1-ha scale but showed a degree of segregation at the individual scale, suggesting that some avoidance existed. Three diet types were observed in the godwits in the area: (1) dominated by soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus) on sand, (2) dominated by sentinel crabs (Macrophthalmus spp.) in seagrass, and (3) dominated by soft-bodied prey in seagrass."

After two months of treatment, reldan reduced valve activity more than roundup; the rest period increased with increasing time of exposure. There was direct relationship between valve movement and metabolic heat output of respiration and excretion. The decrease in respiration rate was associated with a decrease in ammonia excretion. Thus valve-movement responses of R. decussatus to 1/2 LC50 of the two pesticides are type-dependent. Both pesticides reduced physiological condition, but reldan is more potent than roundup and its effect is time-dependent. Respiration and excretion rates were components of the energy expenditure that accounted for the decline in metabolism and excretion with increasing the time of exposure to pesticides.

However, these models generally assume that animals choose their action before observing the behaviour of their opponents while, in many natural situations, individuals in fact continuously react to the actions of others. A negotiation process then takes place and this may fundamentally influence the individual attitudes and the tendency to cooperate. Here, I use the classical model system of vigilance behaviour to demonstrate the consequences of such behavioural negotiation among selfish individuals, by predicting patterns of vigilance in a pair of animals foraging under threat of predation. I show that the game played by the animals and the resulting vigilance strategies take radically different forms, according to the way predation risk is shared in the pair. In particular, if predators choose their target at random, the prey respond by displaying moderate vigilance and taking turns scanning. By contrast, if the individual that takes flight later in an attack endures a higher risk of being targeted, vigilance increases and there is always at least one sentinel in the pair. Finally, when lagging behind its companion in fleeing from an attacker becomes extremely risky, vigilance decreases again and the animals scan simultaneously."

We conducted a quantitative review of the primate literature on sex differences in involvement in protection against predation. We found that males were more likely to be at the front of group progressions, especially in contexts of increased risk, were more vigilant, sometimes to the point of becoming sentinels, were more active in mobbing, and were far more likely to counter-attack felids and monkey-eating raptors than females did. Our evaluation showed that these services may be an expression of male parental care or aimed at bonded partners, but we also encountered many cases in which non-sires, unrelated to either females or immatures, provide them. We hence investigate explanations invoking group augmentation or costly signalling. Currently, available data on male anti-predation services in nonhuman primates do not allow us to distinguish among them, although costly signalling better explains data on birds and humans.

Analysis of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), a one-dimensional integral lake model, was performed to assess its ability to reproduce diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and the sensitivity of simulated fluxes to changes in model parameters, i.e., turbulent transport parameters and the light extinction coefficient (K-d). A C++ open-source software package, Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), was used to perform sensitivity analysis (SA) and identify the parameters that dominate model behavior. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) was applied to quantify the fluxes' uncertainty, comparing daily-averaged eddy-covariance observations to the output of CSLM. Seven qualitative and two quantitative SA methods were tested, and the posterior likelihoods of the modeled parameters, obtained from the GLUE analysis, were used to determine the dominant parameters and the uncertainty in the modeled fluxes. Despite the ubiquity of the equifinality issue - different parameter-value combinations yielding equivalent results-the answer to the question was unequivocal: K-d, a measure of how much light penetrates the lake, dominates sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the uncertainty in their estimates is strongly related to the accuracy with which K-d is determined. This is important since accurate and continuous measurements of K-d could reduce modeling uncertainty."

It is an important vector for three reasons: its opportunistic blood-feeding behavior, its ability to forage and locate hosts in a variety of habitats, and its ability to retain eggs for long periods when suitable oviposition sites are unavailable. Results of laboratory and field observations documenting that Cx. nigripalpus fits the above criteria are presented. Field data are also presented showing that SLE activity in sentinel birds as well as in humans occurs in Florida during years when heavy autumn rainfalls are separated by periods of drought. Blood feeding and oviposition behaviors of Cx. nigripalpus are affected by rainfall. Large amounts of rainfall allow mosquitoes to oviposit and then to enter and blood feed in habitats where they could not previously forage because of the dry conditions. Thus, rainfall patterns are an important part of the SLE transmission cycle in southern Florida."

Meeting increasing demand for meat and other dairy products in a sustainable manner is a big challenge. At a field scale, Global Positioning System and ground-based sensor technologies provide promising tools for grassland and herd management with high precision. With the growth in availability of spaceborne remote sensing data, it is therefore important to revisit the relevant methods and applications that can exploit this imagery. In this article, we have reviewed the (i) current status of grassland monitoring/observation methods and applications based on satellite remote sensing data, (ii) the technological and methodological developments to retrieve different grassland biophysical parameters and management characteristics (i.e. degradation, grazing intensity) and (iii) identified the key remaining challenges and some new upcoming trends for future development.Important FindingsThe retrieval of grassland biophysical parameters have evolved in recent years from classical regression analysis to more complex, efficient and robust modeling approaches, driven by satellite data, and are likely to continue to be the most robust method for deriving grassland information, however these require more high quality calibration and validation data. We found that the hypertemporal satellite data are widely used for time series generation, and particularly to overcome cloud contamination issues, but the current low spatial resolution of these instruments precludes their use for field-scale application in many countries. This trend may change with the current rise in launch of satellite constellations, such as RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and even the microsatellites such as those operated by Skybox Imaging. Microwave imagery has not been widely used for grassland applications, and a better understanding of the backscatter behaviour from different phenological stages is needed for more reliable products in cloudy regions. The development of hyperspectral satellite instrumentation and analytical methods will help for more detailed discrimination of habitat types, and the development of tools for greater end-user operation."

If helping is more difficult for some individuals to do (quality-dependent help), it will usually be done by high-quality individuals, whereas help that all individuals could do equally well (quality-independent help) will be done by whoever pays lower opportunity costs. Our model makes novel predictions about many kinds of helping, allows us to categorize different types of helping by their relationship with individual quality, and is general enough to apply to many situations. Furthermore, it can be generalized to any other type of (nonhelping) behavior where there are individual differences in benefits, performance costs, or opportunity costs."

One of the limitations of early radar studies, the difficulty of maintaining observations over long periods, has recently been overcome by the development of automated units that operate autonomously and transmit summaries of their observations to a base laboratory over the public telephone network. These relatively low-cost Insect Monitoring Radars (IMRs) employ a novel ZLC configuration that allows high quality data on the migrants' flight parameters and identity to be acquired. Two IMRs are currently operating in the semi-arid inland of eastern Australia, in a region where populations of migrant moths (Lepidoptera) and Australian plague locusts Chortoicetes terminifera (Orthoptera) commonly originate, and some examples of outputs from one of these units are presented. IMRs are able to provide the data needed to characterize a migration system, i.e. to estimate the probabilities of migration events occurring in particular directions at particular seasons and in response to particular environmental conditions and cues. They also appear capable of fulfilling a sentinel role for pest-management organisations, alerting forecasters to major migration events and thus to the likely new locations of potential target populations. Finally, they may be suitable for a more general ecological monitoring role, perhaps especially for quantifying year-to-year variations in biological productivity."

Secondly, we examined the influence of relatedness on scan effort (percent overlapping) and temporal distribution of scanning using linear regression. Finally, we evaluated whether temporal distributions of scanning were significantly lower (coordination) or higher (synchrony) than random expectations using bootstrapping. We found that pairwise relatedness between focal degus and their foraging partner did not influence the scan effort or the temporal distribution of scanning.

Both a higher water vapour conductance and parental favouritism during incubation could explain the shorter incubation period for the B-egg than for the A-egg. Because the incubation period is increased by the presence of a sibling for A-eggs, but not for B-eggs, and because both egg categories have the same incubation period when they are incubated alone, it has been suggested that the difference in incubation period was largely driven by the parental favouritism for B-eggs during incubation. We tested whether A- and B-eggs show a difference in laying density, density at the beginning of incubation and in density decrease during incubation according to the presence of a sibling. Although density at the start of incubation was significantly higher for B-eggs than for A-eggs, the decrease in density during incubation had the same slope for both egg categories. Moreover, the presence of a sibling did not influence densities. We additionally provide two equations that allow the back-dating of laying dates for a clutch of SouthernRockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes c. chrysocome) and we discuss the precision of the method (3.04 +/- A 2.29 days for A-eggs and 2.73 +/- A 2.10 days for B-eggs) for penguins which are increasingly being used as marine environmental sentinels."

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the theoretical treatment of minimum extremes and, specifically, minimum flows. The method has two approaches: i) conventional; ii) asymptotic. In conventional analysis, the Weibull (W2) and Lognormal distributions of two parameters (LN2) were adjusted to the series of annual minimum flows and minimum averages of 7-day flows. In the asymptotic analysis approach two parent distributions, the distributions of all average daily flows, with power behavior for minimum flows, are investigated: i) Gamma; ii) LN2. The theory studied in this paper is applied to 11 gauged stations in the Iguacu river basin with 48-year data series. It was concluded that the LN2 distribution presents the best fit according to the chi(2) test. It was found that the Gamma distribution, with respect to the minimums, tends to a power function, and consequently the W2 distribution. The parameters k, b and mu(X), of the normalized annual minimum flow series are well-fitted to the LN2 distribution. According to both approaches, LN2 can be recommended for studies of minimum flows in the Iguacu river basin."

Among them, associations with non-primate mammals (n=43) and birds (n=59) occupied most of the reported cases. Many polyspecific associations between primates and other mammal species were reported from Asia and Africa, while those between primates and bird species were reported from Central and South America. 34 primate species worldwide formed associations with non-primate animals. Polyspecific associations between primates and other animals included 1) that primates (or other animals) provide food resources to their partner animals and 2) that primates (or other animals) provide anti-predator behavior (e.g., sentinel behavior, loud call, and alarm call). The former association increases foraging benefits to the partner animals, and the latter association decreases predation risk of the partner animals. Most studies, however, pointed out that benefit from given associations are commensalisic, (or even parasitism), i. e. biased to non-primate species. Most of these studies are anecdotal, and do not show quantitative data for the frequency of the association or the benefit of partner animals from participating in the associations. Thus, this interesting phenomenon has not been discussed from an ecological perspective. I recommend several approaches for how to overcome these present challenges."

Nevertheless, they also brought with them new challenges. The data-hungry training processes of deep learning models demand large, resource expensive, annotated datasets and partly replaced knowledge-driven approaches so that model behaviour and the final prediction process became a black box. The proposed SyntEO approach enables Earth observation researchers to automatically generate large deep learning ready datasets by merging existing and procedural data. SyntEO does this by including expert knowledge in the data generation process in a highly structured manner to control the automatic image and label generation by employing an ontology. In this way, fully controllable experiment environments are set up, which support insights in the model training on the synthetic datasets. Thus, SyntEO makes the learning process approachable, which is an important cornerstone for explainable machine learning. We demonstrate the SyntEO approach by predicting offshore wind farms in Sentinel-1 images on two of the worlds largest offshore wind energy production sites. The largest generated dataset has 90,000 training examples. A basic convolutional neural network for object detection, that is only trained on this synthetic data, confidently detects offshore wind farms by minimising false detections in challenging environments. In addition, four sequential datasets are generated, demonstrating how the SyntEO approach can precisely define the dataset structure and influence the training process. SyntEO is thus a hybrid approach that creates an interface between expert knowledge and data-driven image analysis."

Male vigilance may function as a deterrent of extrapair copulation attempts (EPCs) or to ensure male survival, because males of sexually dimorphic species may be more conspicuous to predators than females. However, vigilant males may act as antipredator sentinels to enhance female survivorship, which may also allow females to feed and rest more efficiently, thereby enhancing their ability to form clutches. We attempted to distinguish between the male benefits and female benefits hypotheses by studying the behavior of unpaired males and paired Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) during the preincubation period. Paired males were, on average, four times more vigilant than unpaired males and their mates, which suggests that elevated levels of vigilance by paired males does not function primarily for self-protection against predators. Males were not more vigilant during the female's fertile period, contrary to the paternity assurance hypothesis. Male vigilance during feeding bouts was highest when pairs fed alone near shore-a condition in which feeding was likely more risky. Male vigilance was positively correlated with female feeding when females fed near shore, but not at other times. During resting bouts, males were vigilant 14 +/- 0.01% of the time in all conditions. We suggest that male vigilance may be important to enhance female survival, especially when females feed under risky conditions."

First, 11 pairs of wrens were observed for 2 h during their incubation stages and the rime of each male song and each female exit from, and entrance into, the nest cavity was noted. Of the 60 exits observed, 29 (48%) occurred within 30 s of when the male began a song bout near the nest.

These experimental females spent, on average, 18% more time in nests than did 11 undisturbed control females (47 vs 40 min/h). This occurred only because experimental females waited longer to exit nests during each attentive period. Experimental females did not take shorter recesses. Females may benefit from waiting to exit nests until their mates are singing nearby because: (1) the male's song indicates to the female that no predators are present, (2) males will be present to guard nests, especially against conspecifics, in the female's absence, and/or (3) males can act as sentinels while females are foraging."

The sensor unit is comprised of two inertial measurement units for each bivalve to estimate the angle between the two valves. Monitoring of multiple bivalves is possible with several water-insulated sensor units tethered with flexible cables to a central base station housing the processing unit. Miniaturization of the sensor packaging and flexibility of the wires ensured minimum hindrance to the animals' natural behavior. The precision and accuracy of the angle measurement were tested with a benchtop servo motor setup simulating the gaping behavior. The standard deviation of measurements at a steady state was 0.78 degrees, and the average change in measurement during a 10 degrees step was 9.98 degrees. Over 250 h of in vivo validation experiments demonstrated the consistency of the angle measurements using the presented method alongside a magnetic alternative, which had an average correlation coefficient of -0.89. The sensor system provides an accurate study of bivalve gaping behavior and facilitates the potential use of bivalves as environmental sentinels due to their valve-gaping being a biomarker for monitoring water pollution."

These applications include the development and validation of new and existing algorithms, understanding of the sensor's performance prior to launch, and trade studies to determine ideal sensor configurations. The accuracy of these applications is dependent on the realism of the modeled scenes and sensors. The Digital Image and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) tool has been used extensively to model the complex spectral and spatial texture variation expected in large city-scale scenes and natural biomes. In the past, material properties that were used to represent targets in the simulated scenes were often assumed to be Lambertian in the absence of hand-measured directional data. However, this assumption presents a limitation for new algorithms that need to recognize the anisotropic behavior of targets. We have developed a new method to model and simulate large-scale high-resolution terrestrial scenes by combining bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, high spatial resolution data, and hyperspectral data. The high spatial resolution data is used to separate materials and add textural variations to the scene, and the directional hemispherical reflectance from the hyperspectral data is used to adjust the magnitude of the MODIS BRDF. In this method, the shape of the BRDF is preserved since it changes very slowly, but its magnitude is varied based on the high resolution texture and hyperspectral data. In addition to the MODIS derived BRDF, target/class specific BRDF values or functions can also be applied to features of specific interest. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the techniques and the methodology used to model a forest region at a high resolution. The simulated scenes using this method for varying view angles show the expected variations in the reflectance due to the BRDF effects of the Harvard forest. The effectiveness of this technique to simulate real sensor data is evaluated by comparing the simulated data with the Landsat 8 Operational Land Image (OLI) data over the Harvard forest. Regions of interest were selected from the simulated and the real data for different targets and their Top-of-Atmospheric (TOA) radiance were compared. After adjusting for scaling correction due to the difference in atmospheric conditions between the simulated and the real data, the TOA radiance is found to agree within 5 % in the NIR band and 10 % in the visible bands for forest targets under similar illumination conditions. The technique presented in this paper can be extended for other biomes (e.g. desert regions and agricultural regions) by using the appropriate geographic regions. Since the entire scene is constructed in a simulated environment, parameters such as BRDF or its effects can be analyzed for general or target specific algorithm improvements. Also, the modeling and simulation techniques can be used as a baseline for the development and comparison of new sensor designs and to investigate the operational and environmental factors that affects the sensor constellations such as Sentinel and Landsat missions."

The birds preferred feeding in sandy (40%), light eelgrass (33%) and sandy-mud areas (27%). They showed a distinct horizontal distribution when feeding, with 88% on wet substrates above the water's edge and 10% at the water's edge. Two feeding modes were employed: isolated pecks and multiple pecking and probing. Pecks were the primary feeding actions observed during daylight. The alternative feeding mode of bursts of multiple pecks (with occasional probes) was observed close to dusk and inferred from tracks in the mud to be commonly used after dark. The mean duration of feeding periods in intertidal areas was 329.4 minutes per diurnal tidal cycle (s.d. +/- 93.3), although in some circumstances, these periods were supplemented by feeding in non-tidal areas. The mean peck rate of Double-banded Plovers feeding in single-peck mode was 0.41 pecks per second (s.d. +/- 0.17) and, in the multiple-peck mode, 0.22 pecks per second (s.d. +/- 0.04). The most significant prey species from intertidal areas was the Sentinel Crab Macrophthalamus latifrons. The adaptive significance of the feeding behaviour of the birds is discussed in relation to physical constraints on feeding and the behaviour and ecology of their main prey."

This study responds to the demand for an ongoing, objective, and transparent assessment of the areal extent of sugarcane grown. I have combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with time-series analysis, image-segmentation, and machine-learning, into a model that detects the annual areal extent of sugarcane in Queensland, since 2004. I then contrasted two variants of the model: one applied at the end of autumn (i.e. May), just before the annual harvest begins, and another applied earlier, in mid-summer (end of January), to help expedite the delivery of information for the current growing season. Both models relied heavily on contemporary land-use mapping, and the behaviour of enhanced vegetation index through summer, to detect accurately. The end-of-autumn model detected sugarcane with a user's accuracy of 93%, and a producer's accuracy of 98%, based on 596 random validation points. In comparison with historical published statistics, the end-of-autumn predictions of areal extent were typically in error by 7.1-10.1% of the observed mean, depending on the spatial scale of interest. The mid-summer model was slightly more volatile, typically in error by 6.8-11.0% of the observed mean. Overall, the results indicate that it is possible to detect-in near-real-time and with reasonable accuracy-the areal extent of sugarcane grown in Queensland in the summer of each year."

In the goby-shrimp association, the fish inhabits the burrow, which is constructed and kept clean by the shrimp, and the fish warns the shrimp of potential dangers approaching their refuge. The porcellanid lives in the burrow and also benefits from living in a habitat where it could not survive without the two sentinel species.

The comparison between the same species from these islands indicated that the mean Vanadium level in the White-cheeked Tern and Bridled Tern on Bani Farour Island were more than Shidvar Island while the average was, in contrast, more for the Lesser Crested Tern nesting on Shidvar Island. There was significant difference between concentrations of Vanadium in sediments of these two islands (p<0.01).

Information gathered on humpback whales is also described. Results confirm the general nomadic behaviour of blue whales and suggest that the GSL represents only a portion of the broad summer feeding range. Results also indicate that individual behaviours on site fidelity vary considerably: occasional vs. regular visitors and cosmopolitan vs. exclusive animals. In addition, we were able to distinguish between several areas of significant blue whale sightings based on temporal trends in the site's frequentation. While the lower Estuary seems to be the area where blue whales are most often sighted, the Mingan region has seen its blue whale frequentation decrease to such an extent that observations are now rare. Conversely, an increasing number of humpback whales have been observed in the Mingan region each year. Because many questions on their general ecology remain unanswered, the aim of this study was to increase our knowledge on the habitat use and behaviour of these rorquals. Furthermore, since marine mammals have been proposed as ecosystem sentinels, long-term monitoring can detect spatial or temporal trends that could reflect changing processes in the environment."

We considered the time intervals before and after the announcement of lockdown, including the same periods for 2019. The results showed that NO2 and PM10 concentrations fell by similar to 30% and 44%, respectively, at urban stations during lockdown compared to 2019. An increase in PM at the industrial station (64% PM2.5 and 8% PM10) could be due to the contribution of industrial sources other than vehicle traffic. Also, we observed a reduction of the tropospheric NO2 column density mean by 54% at urban stations, and AOD values decreased between 38% and 66% during 2020. Concerning the spatial distribution, the tropospheric NO2 column showed a significant reduction of NO2 for the monthly mean in the metropolitan area at lockdown. Similarly, the AOD highest values had a greater extension for 2020 during the pre-lockdown monthly period.

The analysis is performed by means of the lumped model air2water, which simulates lake surface temperature as a function of air temperature alone. The model provides information about the seasonal stratification dynamics, suggesting that unusual warming events can result from two factors: anomalously high summer air temperatures, and increased strength of stratification resulting from a warm spring. The relative contribution of the two factors is quantified using the model by means of synthetic scenarios, which provide a simple but effective description of the positive feedback between the thermal behavior and the stratification dynamics of the lake."

Trials were conducted with single naive female parasitoids in 10-cm Petri dishes that were either empty, contained flour, or contained millet. Empty 15-cm Petri dishes, which served as a surface area control, comprised a fourth treatment. Females were allowed to forage for sentinel egg disks for 2 h, after which percentages of parasitism and egg mortality were computed. In addition, behavioral observations were made on a subset of the trials. Trichogramma deion parasitized more eggs than the other two species in the empty dishes and in the dish containing flour. For T deion, rates of parasitism and egg mortality were significantly greater in both the small and large empty dishes than in the small dishes containing flour or millet. Parasitism was consistently low for all three species in the grain-filled dishes. Among species, T ostriniae spent the most time walking, while T pretiosum was the most sedentary. In addition, T pretiosum spent significantly more time on the first egg visited compared with subsequent eggs. T deion may be the best-suited for use as a biological control agent for P. interpunctella.

As tropospheric NO(2)vertical column densities (VCDs) from TROPOMI have become available since February 2018, this study presents the comparisons of NO(2)data measured by TROPOMI and its predecessor Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over China, together with validation against ground Multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements. At the nationwide scale, we used two different filters performed for the TROPOMI data (named TROPOMI50 and TROPOMI75), and the TROPOMI50 yielded larger values than TROPOMI75. The TROPOMI NO(2)datasets from different filters show consistent spatial patterns with OMI, and the correlation coefficient values were both above 0.93. However, linear regression indicates that NO(2)loadings in TROPOMI is about 2/3 to 4/5 of those in OMI, which is presumably due to a different cloud mask and uncertainties of air mass factors. The absolute difference is prominent over the high pollution areas such as Jing-Jin-Ji region and during winter and autumn, exceeding 0.6 x 10(16)molecules cm(-2)(molec cm(-2)). However, the NO(2)concentrations retrieved from TROPOMI50 in the southern China may be somewhat higher than OMI. When it comes to the local-scale Jing-Jin-Ji hotspot, the analysis focuses on a comparison to TROPOMI75. TROPOMI manifests high quality and exhibits a significantly better performance of representing spatial variability. In contrast, OMI shows fewer effective pixels and does a poor job of capturing local details due to its row anomaly and low resolution. The absolute difference between two datasets shows the same seasonal behavior with NO(2)variation, which is most striking in the winter (0.31 x 10(16)molec cm(-2)) and is lowest in the summer (0.05 x 10(16)molec cm(-2)). Furthermore, the ground MAX-DOAS instrument in Xianghe station, the representative site in Jing-Jin-Ji, is used to assess the skill of satellite retrievals. It turns out that both OMI and TROPOMI underestimate the observations, ranging from 30% to 50%, with OMI being less biased. In spite of the negative drift, the temporal structures of changes derived from OMI and TROPOMI closely match the ground-based records, since the correlation coefficients are above 0.8 and 0.95 for daily and monthly scales, respectively. Overall, TROPOMI NO(2)retrievals are better suited for applications in China as well as the Jing-Jin-Ji hotspot due to its higher spatial resolution, although some improvements are also needed in the near future."

Polyandrous trios consisted of a female and male breeder, as well as a subordinate co-breeding male. Pale chanting goshawk males performed most of the interspecific territorial maintenance duties, as well as participating in aggressive intraspecific interactions against other males on territory borders. Intraspecific territorial interactions were almost exclusively recorded in high-quality habitat, Karroid Broken Veld, and probably functioned in the defence of foraging habitat and potential mates. In this habitat, males of polyandrous families largely occupied exclusive sections of a territory. It is suggested that the cost of defending territories in Karroid Broken Veld was offset by the co-breeder's contribution to high-risk, intraspecific territorial defence. During the nestling period females of polyandrous trios stayed at nesting sites for longer periods than did monogamous females and all males, enabling these females to guard the nest and act as sentinels. Predation of nestlings was recorded at the nests of monogamous pairs, but not at those of polyandrous trios. Go-breeders did not guard the nesting site but contributed directly to nest defence by either coming to the female's aid when solicited, or attacking potential predators when present at the nesting site. Go-breeders may also have helped indirectly, through activities such as provisioning prey to females that relieved them of their hunting duties. We suggest that the female's nest guarding and the resulting lower nest predation may hold reproductive and fitness benefits for polyandrous breeders."

This is shown by compiling retrospective data on fish catches and anecdotal observations, which in some cases date back to the mid-19th century. The AMO is defined as the de-trended mean of North Atlantic (0-60 degrees N) sea surface temperature anomalies. However, it is not primarily the temperature which drives the dynamics of the small pelagic fish populations. Instead, the AMO seems to be a proxy for complex processes in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system of the North Atlantic. This is manifested in large-scale changes in strength and direction of the current system that move water masses around the North Atlantic and likely involves the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the Mediterranean Overflow Water (MOW) and the subpolar gyre (SPG). The contractions and expansions of the SPG apparently play a key role. This was particularly obvious in the mid-1990s, when the SPG abruptly contracted with the result that warm subtropical water masses moved to the north and east. Small pelagic fish populations in the eastern North and Central Atlantic, including those in the Mediterranean responded quickly by changing abundances and migrating northwards. It seems that the complex ocean-atmosphere changes in the mid-1990s, which are described in the text in detail, caused a regime shift in the ecosystems of the eastern North and Central Atlantic and the small pelagic clupeoid fish populations are the sentinels of this shift.

Male catch was reduced to 11% of control females in traps containing females irradiated at 300Gy. Isotope analysis of spermatophores found in the bursa copulatrix of females indicated that mating success of irradiated males inside the live (entry-only) traps containing virgin females was lower (13.1 +/- 3.3%) than suggested by male catch (21.2 +/- 3.8%) in pheromone traps, the current standard for assessing field competitiveness. Impacts of irradiation on male and female moth fitness should be taken into account to improve estimates of irradiated to wild male E.postvittana overflooding ratios needed for population suppression."

One female remained incarcerated for 77 days, two of three broods completed fledging around May 20 (1995, 1997). Details on fledging of the female and her brood and postfledging care by both parents are reported.The food of the males at two nests was ca. 98% fruits and 2% invertebrates. The plants exploited comprised at least 14 species. Over a third of the fruits delivered were figs of a small number of species.Two males had average feeding rates of 0.56 and 0.88 times per hour respectively, and fed 1 to 66 (median 8) items per feeding visit at the nest. The hourly feeding rate increased after hatching, but the composition of the diet did not change noticeably. As a rule, food items were delivered singly and, during one visit, in runs of one, or rarely up to 3, species.In the three weeks following vacation of the nest, the male appeared to be the sole food provider while the female stayed continually with the 3 young (as sentinel?) in the vicinity of the nest.The nest environs were defended by the male against Tarictic Hornbills (Penelopides panini panini). Six vocalisations of the parents are mentioned. One was used in territorial skirmishes with Tarictic Hornbills.With perhaps less than 30 pairs of the Writhed-bill surviving, the future for the species looks bleak. Only drastic conservation measures can prevent the species' demise. Some have been started by the PESCP."

Remotely sensed data provide an ever-increasing amount of environmental and climatic variables at high spatiotemporal resolutions, and a unique opportunity to produce fine-scale habitat models particularly useful in challenging environments, such as high-elevation areas. Working at a 10-m spatial resolution, we assessed the value of remotely sensed data for investigating foraging habitat selection (in relation to topography, microclimate, land cover) in nestling-rearing white-winged snowfinch (Montifringilla nivalis), a high-elevation species highly sensitive to climate change. Adult snowfinches foraged at locations with intermediate vegetation cover and higher habitat heterogeneity, also avoiding extremely warm or extremely cold microclimates. Temperature interacted with other environmental drivers in defining habitat selection, highlighting trade-offs between habitat profitability and thermoregulation: snowfinches likely adopted mechanisms of behavioural buffering against physiologically stressful conditions by selecting for cooler, shaded and more snowy foraging grounds at higher temperatures. Our results matched those from previous studies based on accurate field measurements, confirming the species' reliance on climate-sensitive microhabitats (snow patches and low-sward grassland, in heterogeneous patches) and the usefulness of satellite-derived fine-scale modelling. Habitat suitability models built on remotely sensed predictors can provide a cost-effective method for periodic monitoring of species' habitats both at fine grain and over large extents. Fine-scale models also enhance our understanding of the actual drivers of (micro)habitat selection and of possible buffering behaviours against warming, allowing more accurate and robust distribution models, finer predictions of potential future changes and carefully targeted conservation strategies and habitat management."

The land deformation may cause several impacts on the environment and human life. A good understanding of the deformation behaviour of the soil is essential to mitigate risks on the infrastructure and environment. In this study, a radar interferometry is carried out to analyse the mobility of an urban and suburban area of Greater Tunis region. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique has been proven to be an effective methodology for detecting and monitoring soil displacement with millimetre accuracy and also, improving our understanding of the current deformations in the study area. Indeed, the application of differential SAR interferometry made it possible to determine the origin of the surface deformations related to natural or anthropic phenomena. In this paper, the interferometric method of small baseline subset (SBAS) developed by Berardino et al. 2002has been chosen, in order to monitor the spatial and temporal pattern of the deformation phenomena in Greater Tunis region. The analysis of Envisat ASAR (2003-2007, descending satellite orbit) and Sentinel 1B (2016-2018, ascending satellite orbit) SAR data allowed us to create deformation velocity maps associated with line of sight displacement time series. The results obtained by this method showed the existence of subsidence phenomenon in the urban areas (Tunis City) as well as in the rural areas (Mornag plain). In the first site (Tunis City), the subsidence rate reaches up to 13.98 mm/year and 19 mm/year during 2003-2007 and 2016-2018, respectively. The ground deformation that is detected around the region of Tunis Lake and Sebkhet Essijoumi, is probably due to the nature of the highly compressible and thickness alluvial deposits and whose substratum depth sometimes reaches more than 60 m. In the second studied site, ground subsidence was identified in the whole plain of Mornag. Indeed, the comparison between piezometric data and time series deformations shows that the trend of soil subsidence is coherent with the dynamic change in groundwater levels. Furthermore, the analysis of velocity deformation, geological data and hydrogeological information allows us to associate all the detected settlement patterns to groundwater overexploitation and compressible alluvium all over the plain. This overexploitation of groundwater in Mornag plain is mainly caused by the expansion of agricultural and industrial activities and the decrease in annual rainfall in recent years (from 2003 to 2018)."

We examined whether the anti-predation strategies of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) are adapted to the hunting strategies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Tdi chimpanzees search for red colobus groups, approach them silently and hunt co-operatively. Our playback experiments and observations of natural encounters revealed that red colobus hid higher up the trees in positions where exposure to the forest floor is minimal and became silent, when chimpanzees were close. They moved away silently through the canopy, when chimpanzees were still at some distance. However, if a group of diana monkeys was nearby in the latter situation, red colobus sought their presence even if they had to move towards the chimpanzees. Chimpanzees refrained from hunting associated red colobus groups, probably because diana monkeys are excellent sentinels for predators approaching over the forest floor. Thus several elements of both the predator's and the prey's strategies correspond to each other. Finally, we compared the interactions between the two species in Tai and in Gombe, Tanzania. We suggest that the difference in size ratio between the two species at the two sites and adaptation of hunting techniques and of escape modes to different forest structures can explain why Gombe red colobus attack chimpanzees while Tai red colobus try to escape. We conclude that predator-prey interactions can indeed lead to evolutionary arms races, with the specific form of co-adaptations depending on environmental factors."

Because few studies of birds and mammals that have reported the effect of distance to conspecifics on the vigilance of focal animals have considered solitary prey species, we tested this effect in wombats. Our results show that a model including distance to cover and distance to the nearest conspecific, but not time of day, best explained the variation in the proportion of time that focal individuals spent in vigilance. Individual vigilance decreased when distance to cover increased. Vigilance of wombats increased when there was a conspecific within a radius of 70 m of the focal individual. In addition, we tested whether pairs of nearby wombats scanned independently of one another, coordinated their activity in non-overlapping bouts of vigilance or synchronised their bouts of vigilance. Wombats in close proximity exhibited independent bouts of individual vigilant and foraging activity. Thus, in this solitary species, our results support the assumption that individuals scan independently of each other."

The latter was observed in five species, across three subgenera, most species exhibiting grasping fight behavior. Both fight patterns usually started with leg touching/pushing, followed by mounting and grasping. Fights usually ended with grasping, but in the claw-extending pattern, lateral extension of the chelipeds in both combatants occurred after grasping. Fighting behavior between females could be divided into two patterns; leg-intertwining fight and leg-extending fight, the latter being observed only in two species of subgenus Macrophthalmus. Most species exhibited leg-intertwining fight. Male waving display could be classified into four patterns, including vertical non-forward-pointing type, vertical forward-pointing type, lateral non-forward-pointing type and lateral forward-pointing type, depending upon in cheliped movement. The differences between the four waving patterns involve the chelipeds being moved either vertically or laterally, and extended forward while raised or not. Lateral movement was observed in only three species, M. banzai, M. erato and M. quadratus, most species exhibiting vertical movement. Forward-pointing movements were observed in four species, but were absent in all species of subgenus Mareotis and two species of subgenus Macrophthalmus.

We demonstrate that River Otters are reproducing, and report here on the 1st sightings in decades in Alameda, San Francisco, and Santa Clara counties indicating a possible gradual expansion of the species' range southward. Within our Intensive Study Area in coastal Marin County, conservatively estimated densities ranged from 0.21 to 0.32 River Otters/km, with otters inhabiting a range of habitats from freshwater to marine. A pilot assessment of disease and mortality indicates that otters are being exposed to pathogens such as Vibrio and that observable mortality was largely due to car-strikes. We also report on timing of mating, timing of pup-juvenile emergence, and pup-juvenile production. Despite large-scale ecosystem restoration actions underway across the San Francisco Bay Area, River Otters have been overlooked by resource managers. Being apex carnivores that not only directly benefit from restoration actions but also likely play a significant role in the outcome of recovery actions focused on endangered salmonids and waterfowl, we strongly recommend attention to their potential role as a keystone species in the San Francisco Bay Area."

One of the key theoretical and empirical findings underlying this conclusion is that cooperative systems have a degree of kin structure, often the product of delayed dispersal, that facilitates interactions with relatives. However, recent population genetic studies have revealed that many non-cooperative animals also have kin-structured populations, providing more cryptic opportunities for kin selection to operate. In this article, I first review the evidence that kin structure is widespread among non-cooperative vertebrates, and then consider the various contexts in which kin selection may occur in such taxa, including: leks, brood parasitism, creches, breeding associations, territoriality and population dynamics, foraging and predator deterrence. I describe the evidence that kin-selected benefits arise from interacting with kin in each of these contexts, notwithstanding the potential costs of kin competition and inbreeding. I conclude that as the tools required to determine population genetic structure are readily available, measurement of kin structure and the potential for kin selection on a routine basis is likely to reveal that this process has been an important driver of evolutionary adaptation in many non-cooperative as well as cooperative species."

Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan capable of infecting all warm-blooded animals, including humans, primarily through a free-living oocyst and/or tissue cyst life stage. Anthropogenic disturbance is facilitating the spread of T. gondii, making it crucial to understand the general ecological and life-history drivers of T. gondii infections in wild birds, which are important intermediate hosts. Our goal was to determine how habitat (terrestrial versus aquatic), dietary trophic level and scavenging behaviour influence the prevalence of T. gondii infection in wild birds at a global scale.Location Global.Time period 1952-2017.Major taxa studied Birds.Methods Our analysis used the serological, bioassay and molecular prevalence data of T. gondii in avian species compiled from 81 studies conducted worldwide and encompassing 24,344 individuals from 393 avian species from 84 families.Results We showed that at a global scale, trophic level and habitat interacted significantly to influence T. gondii prevalence in avian intermediate hosts. In the terrestrial environment, T. gondii prevalence increased with trophic level, consistent with predominant tissue cyst transmission. The highest prevalence was in terrestrial omnivores, which might reflect their synanthropic foraging behaviour. In aquatic species, prevalence was more consistent across trophic levels, but high prevalence in aquatic herbivores and insectivores reflects significant waterborne exposure to oocysts. Contrary to our predictions, generalized scavenging per se was not associated with increased prevalence.Main conclusions This study highlights the value of comparing pathogen prevalence among multiple ecological guilds and ecosystem types for a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of generalist pathogens, such as T. gondii. Increased effort is needed to reduce T. gondii spillover from the domestic cat cycle into wildlife populations."

The lithology of the Northern Apennines fold and thrust belt is characterized by alternations of sandstone, siltstone and clayshales, also known as flysch, and clay shales with a chaotic block in matrix fabric, which are often interpreted as tectonic or sedimentary melanges. While flysch rocks with a high pelitic fraction host earthslides that occasionally evolve into flow like movements, earthflows are the dominant landslide type in chaotic clay shales. In the present work, we document the kinematic response to rainfall of landslides in these different lithologies using radar interferometry. The study area includes three river catchments in the Northern Apennines. Here, the Mediterranean climate is characterized by two wet seasons during autumn and spring respectively, separated by dry summers and winters with moderate precipitation. We use SAR imagery from the X-band satellite COSMO SkyMed and from the C-band satellite Sentinel 1 to retrieve spatial displacement measurements between 2009 and 2016 for 25 landslides in our area of interest. We also document detailed temporal and spatial deformation signals for eight representative landslides, although the InSAR derived deformation signal is only well constrained by our dataset during the years 2013 and 2015. In spring 2013, long enduring rainfalls struck the study area and numerous landslide reactivations were documented by the regional authorities. During 2013, we measured higher displacement rates on the landslides in pelitic flysch formations compared to the earthflows in the clay shales. Slower mean velocities were measured on most landslides during 2015. We analyse the temporal deformation signal of our eight representative landslides and compare the temporal response to precipitation. We show that earthslides in pelitic flysch formations accelerate faster than earthflows in chaotic clay shales and reach higher velocities, while the kinematic behaviour of the earthflows can be described as rather steady with only minor accelerations. Although we have no detailed pore pressure measurements for the period of interest, the observed behaviour can be explained in our view by the morphological and hydrological characteristics of the different landslide types. On the one hand landslide material and bedrock in the pelitic flysch rocks are more resistant, which is why slope angles are higher in this lithology. On the other hand, landslides in the pelitic flysch formations have often deeper slip surfaces and landslide material is more permeable. This is why long persistent rainfall is necessary to saturate the landslide material and induce pore pressures that are high enough to trigger displacement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A new, fast, and cost-effective approach was developed, using water surface change as a proxy, to evaluate the sediment deposition rate. In the current research, this methodology was applied in the Moulay Bousselham Lagoon in Morocco, and a combination of Landsat 8 and Landsat 5 imagery acquired at four points in time over 30 years (1985-2015) was used. Following geometric correction and enhancement, the interpretation of the acquired images provided important insight on the current conditions of the water surface change using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Several iterations were done to determine a suitable threshold for effective water surface detection. In order to validate the automatically extracted water surface features, many band combinations of Landsat and Sentinel 2 were used as references to run the accuracy assessment. The results show that the Moulay Bousselham Lagoon lost 17.60% (106 ha) of its water surface area, and 530,000 m(3) to 1,060,000 m(3) of its water volume during the last three decades. Converting water surface loss into sedimentation returned a rate of 0.58 cm/yr. These results have been confirmed by previous field work using sedimentological approaches.

In addition to reproductive skew, group members may also exhibit social skew, where some individuals show particular behaviors more often than others. Significant social skew in behaviors such as anti-predator defense or social interactions may influence survival and reproduction. Therefore, social skew has the potential to translate into reproductive skew and affect group productivity. We measured social skew across groups in a population of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). Several behaviors such as agonistic interactions, affiliative interactions, and first emergence were significantly skewed in most groups. Alarm calling, however, was infrequently skewed more than would be expected by random chance. Thus, marmot groups do not appear to have behavioral roles in terms of individuals acting like sentinels. Although significant social skew was present, it did not obviously affect fitness as measured by female reproductive success for each group. However, skew in individual-directed behavior (e.g. agonistic and affiliative interactions) did significantly correlate with the level of reproductive skew. Finally, the results were independent of the scale at which groups were defined. Behavioral variability appears to occur similarly across the entire marmot population. The results of this study illustrate that the quantification of social skew has potential to be a powerful tool for understanding the evolution of sociality."

While nest characteristics are expected to vary adaptively in response to environmental conditions, large-scale spatial variation in nest characteristics has been largely overlooked. Here, we examine the effects of latitudinal variation in spring temperatures on nest characteristics, including insulatory properties, and reproductive success of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, and great tits, Parus major. Location Great Britain. Methods Nests and reproductive data were collected from seven study sites, spread over 5 degrees of latitude. The nest insulatory properties were then determined before the nests were separated into nest base material and cup lining material. Results As spring temperatures increased with decreasing latitude, the mass of the nest base material did not vary in either species, while the mass of the cup lining material and nest insulatory properties decreased in both species. This suggests that in response to increasing temperatures the breeding female reduces the mass of the cup lining material, thereby maintaining an appropriate microclimate for incubating and brooding. The mean first egg date of both species advanced with decreasing latitude and increasing spring temperatures, although clutch size and brood size at hatching and fledging did not vary. Main conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate that the nest-construction behaviour of birds varies in response to large-scale spatial variation in ambient temperatures. Therefore, nest composition reliably indicates environmental conditions and we suggest that studies of nest structure may be sentinels for the early signs of rapid climate change."

Possible use of the BG Sentinel (BGS) trap to sample Anopheles gambiae s.s. was evaluated. The efficiency of this trap was compared with that of the Mosquito Magnet-X (MM-X) trap, when baited with foot odour alone or combinations of foot odour with carbon dioxide (CO2) or lemongrass as behaviour-modifying cues. Methods: Female An. gambiae s.s. were released in an experimental flight arena that was placed in a semi-field system and left overnight. Catch rates for the MM-X and BGS traps were recorded. Data were analysed by fitting a generalized linear model to the (n+1) transformed catches. Results: Both types of traps successfully captured mosquitoes with all odour cues used. When the BGS trap was tested against the MM-X trap in a choice assay with foot odour as bait, the BGS trap caught about three times as many mosquitoes as the MM-X trap (P = 0.002). Adding CO2 (500 ml/ min) to foot odour increased the number of mosquitoes caught by 268% for the MM-X (P < 0.001) and 34% (P = 0.051) for the BGS trap, compared to foot odour alone. When lemongrass leaves were added to foot odour, mosquito catches were reduced by 39% (BGS, P < 0.001) and 38% (MM- X, P = 0.353), respectively. Conclusion: The BGS trap shows high potential for field trials due to its simple construction and high catch rate when baited with human foot odour only. However, for rapid screening of different baits in a contained semi-field system, the superior discriminatory power of the MM-X trap is advantageous."

Studies of vigilance are generally concerned with exploring the relationship between vigilance rates and group size. However, a mechanistic understanding of the rules individual animals use to achieve this group-level behavior is lacking. Building on a previous modeling approach, we suggest that individuals reconcile their own private information against the social information they receive from their group mates in order to decide whether to feed or be vigilant at any one time. We present a novel modeling approach utilizing a Markov chain Monte Carlo process to describe the transition between vigilant and nonvigilant states. Many of our assumptions are based qualitatively on recently published experimental observations. We vary the amount of social information and the fidelity with which individuals process this information and show that this has a profound effect on the individual vigilance rate, the individual vigilant bout length, and the proportion of vigilant individuals at any one time. A wide range of group-level vigilance patterns can be obtained by varying simple behavioral characteristics of individual animals. We find that generally, increasing the amount of, and sensitivity to, social information generates a more cooperative vigilance behavior. This model potentially provides a theoretical and conceptual framework for examining specific real-life systems. We propose analyzing individual-based data from real animals by considering their group to be a connected network of individuals, with information transfer between them."

Samples were collected monthly (December 2011 to November 2012) from two different sites, Sidi Salem a polluted site and Hnaya as a control site. Obtained results revealed an increase in CAT activity and a decrease in GSH rate in fish from the polluted site (Sidi Salem) compared to the control site (Hnaya). The biochemical analysis revealed a significant decrease in protein, lipid and carbohydrate amounts in Sidi Salem comparatively to El Hnaya. In addition, the higher levels in biochemical components (protein, lipid and carbohydrate) are recorded in summer and the lower rates in winter at El Hnaya site, this is related to respectively the beginning and the end of the reproduction period. Thus, the difference noted between the two sites may be due to their pollution level. The level of pollution in Sidi Salem induced an oxidative stress associated with a mobilization of energetic metabolism for detoxification or for physiological processes such as 'owth or reproduction, Overall, obtained data indicate that L. aurata constitutes a useful tool as sentinel organisms for biomonitoring of aquatic pollution."

The American pika (Ochotona princeps) has been suggested as a sentinel of montane climate change, largely due to its sensitivity to warm temperatures and high exposure to changing climatic conditions. Pikas use talus to thermoregulate and have been shown to persist more often in talus slopes that create stable microclimates. However, many studies of pika behavior and persistence use metrics of climate measured above the talus surface, outside of the proposed microclimates that pikas can access. We paired fine-scale microclimate measurements with behavioral observations of uniquely tagged pikas in the Colorado Rocky Mountains to model how pikas might use talus subsurface habitat as a microrefuge. Our findings suggest that pikas spend more time on the surface of the talus when there is a stronger gradient in temperatures between shallow (0.1 m below the surface) and deep (1 m below the surface) regions of the talus, especially during the middle of the day when shallow temperatures are warmer. These results underscore the importance of pairing fine-scale data on microclimate with behavioral observations of tagged individuals to more accurately evaluate how animals might use climate refugia to persist in changing conditions."

At the portal of each nest of the Oriental hornet (Vespa orientalis, Hymenoptera, Vespinae) there are worker hornets that beat their wings in synchrony with one another, during summer months and at the onset of daylight. These ventilating hornets stand at regular intervals around the nest entrance, not touching, and with their heads facing largely outwards. Although the ventilating hornets stand apart from one another, their wings beat at a uniform pace and there is no connection whatsoever between these hornets and the sentinel worker hornet (or hornets) that inspect those entering the nest. The ventilatory wing beating lasts 3.4 min on average, and upon completion, the ventilating worker either emerges to forage in the field or more often retreats back into the nest. Young queens have seldom been seen ventilating and males have never been seen engaged in such activity. Ordinarily, no ventilatory activity takes place upon the brood combs inside, such as is observed in artificial breeding boxes with a transparent wall, but on rare occasions ventilation may also occur on the inner side of the portal. In cases where there is more than one portal to the nest, the ventilatory activity will occur at each of these sites. Apparently every hornet worker engages in such ventilation at one time or another and their number at any one time is temperature-dependent, that is, the higher the ambient temperature the greater the number the hornets participating in ventilation. Indeed the correlation between the temperature and the ventilatory activity is positive and highly significant."

Here we quantify the independent and interactive effects of multiple concurrent changes to resources and consumers in an invaded annual grassland community in California. In a two-year study using thirty-seven 400-m(2) plots, we examine interactions among four nutrient treatments (N, P, K and micronutrients) and a keystone herbivore (pocket gopher Thomomys bottae) on four plant community outcomes: 1) plant diversity, 2) functional group composition, 3) net biomass production, an important ecosystem function, and 4) infection risk by a group of viral pathogens shared by crop and non-crop grasses (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses), an important regulating ecosystem service. We found that grassland biodiversity and infection risk were controlled by nutrient identity and supply ratio whereas nutrients interacted strongly with consumers to control grassland composition and net primary productivity. The most important insights arising from this multi-factor experiment are that net biomass production increased with phosphorus or nitrogen supply; however, when gophers were present, nitrogen caused no net effect on biomass production. In addition, infection risk was driven by phosphorus, nitrogen and micronutrient supply. Infection in a sentinel host increased strongly with the addition of micronutrients or phosphorus; however, infection declined with increasing N/P supply ratio, indicating stoichiometric control of infection risk. Finally, in spite of manipulating multiple factors, plant species richness declined with nitrogen, alone. The importance of higher-order interactions demonstrates that a multi-factor approach is critical for effective predictions in a world in which anthropogenic activities are simultaneously changing herbivore abundance and the relative supply of many nutrients."

We document the deformation history of four dormant deep-seated landslides in the Northern Apennines of Italy that were reactivated by the excavation of a double road tunnel. The tunnel is part of a larger infrastructure project that involves the improvement of the Al highway which connects Bologna and Florence. The excavation of the tunnel under the landslides' basal shear surfaces started in 2011, and with the advance of the tunnel front, deformation began to occur, causing damages to homes and infrastructures. The tunnel passes under the small villages of Ripoli and Santa Maria Maddalena. The deformation slowed down after the tunnel was completed in November 2014, and low surface displacement rates were registered for the period between October 2014 and June 2016. We show the results of an InSAR analysis designed to measure surface movements between 2003 and 2016. The InSAR displacements are derived from the Envisat, COSMO SkyMed, and Sentinel 1 datasets and cover the main construction phase of the tunnel (2011-2015). A detailed geological and geomorphological mapping of the slope is developed based on the field evidence and on the spatial pattern of surface deformation provided by our InSAR analysis. Together with the map, a new conceptual geological model of the slope in tectonically sheared and weathered flysch is presented. The satellite InSAR data show good agreement with available ground based monitoring data that include inclinometer and GPS-measurements, while small differences occur with respect to deformation time series obtained from a ground -based InSAR instrument. In particular, the InSAR results for the X -Band data of COSMO SkyMed demonstrate the close relationship between the position of the excavation front and the displacement rates of previously dormant landslide deposits. Conversely, the concurrent rainfall does not appear to significantly influence the observed behavior and, if any, had only a minor influence on the displacement history of the investigated landslides."

In the former, different categories of predators evoke structurally distinct call types which elicit different responses also in the absence of the predator stimulus. In the latter, call parameters and/or call use vary gradually with the degree of perceived risk. However, call types that are typically uttered in the presence of a certain predator category may occasionally occur also in response to other predators. Such 'cross taxon calling' indicates the possibility that also the differential use of acoustically distinct call types could be urgency based. The call system of Arabian babblers (Turdoides squamiceps) comprises three structurally distinct alarm call types. Two of them seem to be predominantly used towards two different predator types, but all call types also occur simultaneously in the same predator context. We hypothesised that in Arabian babblers the differential use of alarm call types reflects an urgency based alarm call system. To test this, we confronted groups of Arabian babblers with an owl dummy in two different distances ('near' and 'far'), representing two degrees of risk or response urgency. We found that not general call type occurrence but call use differed between the two treatments: birds started trilling earlier in the near treatment and uttered more barks in the far treatment. We conclude that the differential use of call types is mediated by the degree of threat a caller perceives. Finally, we synthesize our results together with the findings of other field studies on alarm calling in Arabian babblers and suggest different functions for the three different call types based on their distance related occurrence and acoustic characteristics."

I considered three alternative hypotheses to account for mobbing behaviour: investment in other group members, predator-prey interaction and self-advertisement for the formation of dispersal coalitions. Mobbing response varied with group structure: family groups mobbed more than complex groups in which subordinates were potential breeders. Subordinate group members - potential dispersers - mobbed more than dominant breeders, and females mobbed more than males. Babblers did not increase their mobbing response when vulnerable fledglings were present. The results suggest that babblers may increase their investment in anti-predator behaviour when surrounded by close kin, and that immatures may learn about their potential predators during mobbing. However, snake mobbing by Arabian babblers may also serve functions other than anti-predator defence. It is possible that participation in this risky activity may be an honest signal by which subordinate group members advertise their quality as potential members of dispersal coalitions. However, present data provide only indirect evidence, and more work is needed to assess fitness consequences of advertisement for individual group members."

In commercial papaya, Catica papaya L., in the same region, parasitism was only 22% in tree-collected fruit and 3% in ground-collected fruit. The low level of parasitism in papaya suggests that wild parasitoids may not track the host flies well in commercial fruit and that augmentative parasitoid releases could potentially increase parasitism and thus suppress host fly populations in this habitat. The very low parasitism in ground-collected papaya suggests that E arisanus may avoid foraging on ground fruit. Field cage experiments support this hypothesis. Numbers of females observed on tree fruit were two-fold higher than on ground fruit in small cages and 4-6-fold higher in large cages. In an experiment conducted in a papaya orchard, sentinel fruit was placed within the canopy, on the trunk, or on the ground. Parasitism was significantly higher in the canopy-placed fruit in only one of three trials.

Soil moisture is one of the key variables in land surface modelling, and an inadequate initial soil moisture field can introduce major biases in the surface heat and moisture fluxes and have a long-lasting effect on the model behaviour. Detecting the variability of soil characteristics at small scales is particularly important in mesoscale models because of the continued increase of their spatial resolution. In this paper, the high resolution soil moisture field derived from ENVISAT/ASAR observations is used to derive the soil moisture initial condition for the MM5 simulation of the Tanaro flood event of April 2009. The ASAR-derived soil moisture field shows significantly drier conditions compared to the ECMWF analysis. The impact of soil moisture on the forecast has been evaluated in terms of predicted precipitation and rain gauge data available for this event have been used as ground truth. The use of the drier, highly resolved soil moisture content (SMC) shows a significant impact on the precipitation forecast, particularly evident during the early phase of the event. The timing of the onset of the precipitation, as well as the intensity of rainfall and the location of rain/no rain areas, are better predicted. The overall accuracy of the forecast using ASAR SMC data is significantly increased during the first 30 h of simulation. The impact of initial SMC on the precipitation has been related to the change in the water vapour field in the PBL prior to the onset of the precipitation, due to surface evaporation. This study represents a first attempt to establish whether high resolution SAR-based SMC data might be useful for operational use, in anticipation of the launch of the Sentinel-1 satellite."

We expand the existing catalogue of long-term precipitation records for the island by recovering archived data for an additional eight stations. Following bridging and updating of stations HOMogenisation softwarE in R (HOMER) homogenization software is used to detect breaks using pairwise and joint detection. A total of 25 breakpoints are detected across 14 stations, and the majority (20) are corroborated by metadata. Assessment of variability and change in homogenized and extended precipitation records reveal positive (winter) and negative (summer) trends. Trends in records covering the typical period of digitization (1941 onwards) are not always representative of longer records. Furthermore, trends in post-homogenization series change magnitude and even direction at some stations. While cautionary flags are raised for some series, confidence in the derived network is high given attention paid to metadata, coherence of behaviour across the network and consistency of findings with other long-term climatic series such as England and Wales precipitation. As far as we are aware, this work represents the first application of HOMER to a long-term precipitation network and bodes well for use in other regions. It is expected that the homogenized IIP network will find wider utility in benchmarking and supporting climate services across the Island of Ireland, a sentinel location in the North Atlantic."

Evaluation of these strategies will require accurate and high-throughput methods of predicting mosquito age. We previously developed an age prediction assay for individual Ae. aegypti females based on the transcriptional profiles of a selection of age responsive genes. Here we conducted field testing of the method on Ae. aegypti that were entirely uncaged and free to engage in natural behavior. Methodology/Principal Findings: We produced ''free-range'' test specimens by releasing 8007 adult Ae. aegypti inside and around an isolated homestead in north Queensland, Australia, and recapturing females at two day intervals. We applied a TaqMan probe-based assay design that enabled high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR of four transcripts from three age- responsive genes and a reference gene. An age prediction model was calibrated on mosquitoes maintained in small sentinel cages, in which 68.8% of the variance in gene transcription measures was explained by age. The model was then used to predict the ages of the free-range females. The relationship between the predicted and actual ages achieved an R2 value of 0.62 for predictions of females up to 29 days old. Transcriptional profiles and age predictions were not affected by physiological variation associated with the blood feeding/egg development cycle and we show that the age grading method could be applied to differentiate between two populations of mosquitoes having a two-fold difference in mean life expectancy. Conclusions/Significance: The transcriptional profiles of age responsive genes facilitated age estimates of near-wild Ae. aegypti females. Our age prediction assay for Ae. aegypti provides a useful tool for the evaluation of mosquito control interventions against dengue where mosquito survivorship or lifespan reduction are crucial to their success. The approximate cost of the method was US$7.50 per mosquito and 60 mosquitoes could be processed in 3 days. The assay is based on conserved genes and modified versions are likely to support similar investigations of several important mosquito and other disease vectors."

We examined the relationships between prelaying behavior, food handling and consumption rates, and the timing of breeding of female Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in suburban and wildland habitats. Scrub-jays in suburban habitats had access to ad libitum human-provided foods; wildland jays did not. During both years of this study, suburban scrub-jays bred earlier than their wildland counterparts. Wildland scrub-jays bred earlier in 1997 than in 1996, but the timing of breeding by suburban scrub-jays did not vary between years. Suburban scrub-jays spent less time foraging and more time perching than wildland jays. They handled more food per hour and per foraging hour, suggesting their foraging was more efficient. Despite this, food consumption rates did not differ between the two habitats. Neither time spent foraging or perching nor food consumption rates significantly influenced variation in time of breeding among individuals. Time of breeding was significantly influenced by site, year, and rate of food handling. Individuals that handled more food items per foraging hour, that is, those individuals that were most efficient, were the earliest breeders in both habitats. These results suggest that foraging efficiency increases with access to human-provided food and that resource predictability may be a perceptual cue for the appropriate timing of breeding."

Because parasitoids dispersing from the release fields might pose a threat to native butterflies, the searching efficiency of T. brassicae was investigated in nontarget habitats.2 In field studies, T. brassicae was released at rates of 120 000 females/ha. Parasitism of sentinel Ephestia kuehniella egg clusters was 1.6-3.6% in meadows and 2.0-4.0% in flower strips. The respective figures were 57.6-66.7% and 19.2-46.9% in maize, significantly higher than the parasitism rates in the nontarget habitats. Experiments carried out in small field cages confirmed these results: Again, significantly higher parasitism rates were found in maize compared to meadows and flower strips, and also compared to hedgerows (in sleeve cages).3 To elucidate potential factors underlying the low searching efficiency in nontarget habitats, the behaviour of individual T. brassicae females was investigated on four meadow plants comparatively to maize and a filter paper control. Mean ( SE) walking speed on maize was 2.2 +/- 0.2 mm/s, similar to three of the plants tested and filter paper but significantly higher than on Trifolium pratense (0.85 mm/s). A higher turning rate was found on T pratense, Viola wittrockiana and Plantago lanceolata, in contrast to the longer leaved maize and Alopecurus pratensis. The number of wasps leaving the plant within the observation period differed significantly between plant species, and was twice as high for T. pratense (and the filter paper control) compared to the other plant species.4 In a choice experiment carried out in a climate cabinet with all five host plant species in cages, we obtained the highest parasitism rates on maize and the lowest parasitism on T. pratense, thus confirming the behavioural observations.5 In conclusion, there is evidence for a decreased searching efficiency on plants in nontarget habitats compared to maize. However, the data explain only part of the differences found between parasitism in maize compared to nontarget habitats. Other factors, such as the structural complexity of a habitat, may also play a role. We conclude that the risk for butterfly populations in the tested nontarget habitat due to mass released T. brassicae is low."

Such rhythms are strongly synchronised with the annual cyclic changes by environmental stimuli, the so-called zeitgebers. Animals' reliance on environmental stimuli is highly species-specific and allows behavioural adjustments to be made in preparation for the conditions expected in each season. We investigated daily and annual activity rhythms of Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) by analysing high-resolution data of animals monitored with GPS collars. This first detailed field study of chamois activity showed that this species exhibited clear daily and annual activity rhythms entrained to the light-dark cycle. Chamois were more active during spring-summer and less active during winter, likely in response to the variation in the availability of food resources: both sexes appeared to maximise energy intake during the season offering the highest amount of food resources to compensate for poor food supply during winter. Daily activity was influenced by the climatic factors considered. We showed a negative correlation between daily activity and adverse climatic conditions (i.e. precipitation and, during winter, snow depth). As activity was strongly influenced by the interplay between temperature and wind throughout the year and by radiation and wind in winter, we conjectured that it was critically dependent upon animals' thermal balance. In conclusion, our study highlighted that chamois is well adapted to the Alpine environment and seasonality but also raised questions about its ability to adapt to future climate change.In this study, we investigated the effects of ecological factors on Alpine chamois activity. Thanks to radio collars with accelerometers, we obtained highly detailed information on activity levels of wild animals. We found that chamois were more active during spring-summer (i.e. the seasons with the highest quality and quantity of food) and less active during winter. Our results showed that chamois activity was strongly influenced by such climatic factors as temperature, precipitation and wind speed. In winter time, chamois activity increased during the days with high solar radiation and decreased with high snow depth. Given their wide distribution in the Alps, chamois can be considered as a sentinel species of Alpine habitats. Thus, our results on the current relationship between climate and chamois behaviour may shed light on the animals' ability to track and adapt to climate change."

Most studies of the effects of neighbors on vigilance have focused on individual vigilance. We investigated the effects of neighbors on vigilance in wild red-necked pademelons Thylogale thetis foraging at night in nonpersistent aggregations in a clearing in rain forest. Neither the total number of pademelons in the clearing nor the numbers at various distances around focal individuals affected the individual vigilance of focal animals. However, focal animals' individual vigilance did change with the distance to their nearest neighbor and also with distance to cover. Pairs of individuals closer than 10 m apart tended to synchronize their bouts of individual vigilance and foraging. The degree of synchrony within pairs increased with both distance to cover and the total number of pademelons foraging in the area and decreased with increasing distance to the pair's nearest neighbor but did not vary with the distance separating the members of the pair. Thus, despite their individual vigilance being unaffected by the number of other pademelons in the feeding aggregation, pademelons were nonetheless sensitive to the presence of conspecifics and adjusted their behavior in relation to their separation from neighbors. Thus, some vigilance benefits may be obtained from the presence of conspecifics even in species that aggregate only temporarily on food patches without forming more permanent social groups."

Forest birds were color-banded monthly starting December 1999. Sixty-three observations of flocks were made containing a total of 10 species with a mean (+- SD) of 2.8 +- 0.9 species and 5.4 +- 1.8 individuals per flock. The entire Polylepis bird community contained 30 core species. Since the forest was small, most flocks contained at least some of the same individuals. Three species occurred in > 70% (Giant Conebill Oreomanes fraseri Tawny Tit-Spine-tail Leptasthenura yanacensis, and White-throated Tyrannulet Mecocerculus leucophrys, with 2.6 +- 0.6, 1.9 +- 0.6, and 1.6 +- 0.5 individuals per flock respectively), one species (Asthenes dorbignyi with 1.4 +- 0.5 individuals per flock) in 21%, and the remaining six species in pnd 5% of all flocks. All flock participants except one were insectivores. Individuals of O. fraseri showed high intraspecific group or pair fidelity and often, but not always, acted as flock leader, whereas the sentinel role was mainly assumed by L. yanacensis or A. dorbignyi. For the three species regularly associated with mixed-species flocks, home ranges of banded individuals observed in flocks were determined. Mean home ranges (100% minimum convex polygons) were 6.13 +- 0.87 ha for O. fraseri (n = 4), 2.13 +- 1.26 ha for L. yanacensis (n = 6), and 3.41 +- 2.73 ha for M. leucophrys (n = 3). Intraspecific home range overlap was moderate to high in all species, clear associations of Tawny Tit-Spinetail and White-throated Tyrannulet individuals with one of the two Giant Conebill pairs/groups were lacking, and agonistic interactions were almost absent except in August. In other words, neither individuals nor flocks were territorial, and flocks were much more loosely structured than those studied in Neotropical lowlands, resembling in some respects mixed-species flocks in northern temperate zones. Selective advantages of mixed flocks in Polylepis forests are briefly discussed, finding support only for the predation avoidance hypothesis."

Our temporal metric for measuring carcass longevity and scavenger presence was carcass-day (CD), numbered consecutively from the first day a carcass was recorded until it was consumed. We observed 38 separate carcasses (individual placement), 39 carcasses as part of three-carcass arrays in habitat associated with open, edge, and forest cover types (simultaneous choice), 22 carcasses left along the roadway where killed (monitored in place), and 24 carcasses partially skinned and/or cut open (facilitated). Elk carcasses lasted a mean 11.9 d (range 3-11), with 60% consumed during the first wk. Deer and pronghorn lasted 5.5 d (range 3-12) and 3.0 d (range 2-4), respectively. Ravens normally arrived by CD 3, Bald Eagles by CD 4, and coyotes by CD 6. Bald Eagles relied on ravens for discovery and sentinel duties, whereas both species depended on coyotes for accessibility. Winter- and road-killed carrion, not canine predation, drove carcass availability. Bald Eagles and coyotes used natural carrion more than human-influenced (road-killed or cut-open) carcasses, whereas Common Ravens were uninhibited by the latter. Removing ungulate carcasses from highway rights-of-way and partially opening them will promote quicker carcass consumption and safer avian scavenging by reducing potential for collisions with passing vehicles. A better understanding of the use of road-killed, large ungulate carrion may facilitate managing this supplemental food source as potential mitigation for other anthropogenic threats to both Bald and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), including wind-energy development."

First, we show that SWH from altimetry multi-missions agrees well with in situ water stage at various locations, with the root mean square deviation varying from 10 cm (with Sentinel-3A) to 75 cm (with European Remote Sensing satellite-2). SWE variability from multi-satellite observations also shows a plausible behaviour over a similar to 25-year period when evaluated against in situ observations from the subbasin to basin scale. Both datasets help to better characterize the large spatial and temporal variability in hydrological patterns across the basin, with SWH exhibiting an annual amplitude of more than 5 m in the northern subbasins, while the Congo River main stream and Cuvette Centrale tributaries vary in smaller proportions (1.5 to 4.5 m). Furthermore, SWH and SWE help illustrate the spatial distribution and different timings of the CRB annual flood dynamic and how each subbasin and tributary contribute to the hydrological regime at the outlet of the basin (the Brazzaville/Kinshasa station), including its peculiar bimodal pattern. Across the basin, we estimate the time lag and water travel time to reach the Brazzaville/Kinshasa station to range from 0-1 month in its vicinity in downstream parts of the basin and up to 3 months in remote areas and small tributaries. Northern subbasins and the central Congo region contribute highly to the large peak in December-January, while the southern part of the basin supplies water to both hydrological peaks, in particular to the moderate one in April-May. The results are supported using in situ observations at several locations in the basin. Our results contribute to a better characterization of the hydrological variability in the CRB and represent an unprecedented source of information for hydrological modelling and to study hydrological processes over the region."

MPAs are used sporadically in management of fisheries and are generally based on predicted responses for populations of exploited taxa. However, identification of representative, rare, and high diversity areas of temperate and boreal marine systems, especially on outer continental shelves, is still in its infancy. There is information available from both the scientific literature and from fishers on the life history and behavior of economically important species, on species assemblage patterns, and on physical structure of the marine environment. Such information could be used as a starting point for identifying areas of particular importance to populations or communities of fishes and for the conservation of diversity at the regional scale. Identification of such areas could serve as a basis to design an experimental network of MPAs. Such MPAs, designated for the purpose of maintaining or developing sustainable fisheries, must explicitly be designed within an experimental context, maintaining flexibility for changes in regulations as new information becomes available. Monitoring change in exploited and non-target populations (intra- and inter-guild), habitat complexity indices, and diversity of sentinel taxa (for assessing maintenance of diversity) will be needed to provide feedback to assess the efficacy of MPAs and to recommend changes in the regulatory framework."

Cooperative predator defense can enhance nest success and adult survival but, because it is inherently risky, dynamic risk assessment theory predicts that individuals modify defense behavior according to the risk posed by the predator. Parental investment theory, on the other hand, predicts that reproductive payoffs (brood value) determine investment in nest defense. We propose that, in cooperative breeders, fitness benefits deriving from the survival of other group members may additionally influence defense behavior (social group benefits theory). We tested predictions of these theories in the cooperatively breeding purple-crowned fairy-wren, Malurus coronatus, where brood value is higher for breeders, but social group benefits more important for helpers. We recorded experimentally induced individual defense behaviors in response to predator models presented near nests, representing differing levels of threat to nests and adults. As predicted, 1) individuals engaged in less risky defenses when encountering a more dangerous predator (dynamic risk assessment theory); 2) individuals defended older broods more often, and breeders defended more than helpers (parental investment theory); and 3) helpers were more likely to respond to a predator of adults (social group benefits theory). Our findings highlight that predator defense in cooperative breeders is complex, shaped by the combination of immediate risk and multiple benefits."

Nearly 100% of cercariae placed in a vertical chamber that permitted upward migration with a marginal probability of return swam to the surface in both light and dark conditions, suggesting that a positive phototaxis is not involved in dispersal and that a negative geotaxis may be the critical component in the vertical migration. The presence of a sentinel snail (Biomphalaria glabrata) in the bottom portion of the transmission chamber resulted in a significant reduction of cercariae dispersing upward and a significantly higher intensity of metacercariae in snails under lighted conditions than in the dark. In a light/dark choice experiment the prevalence and intensity of metacercariae was significantly higher in snails in the dark.

To this end, we experimentally manipulated the need for defence in wild groups of the cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher by exposing social groups to four intruder types representing different forms of threat. Intruders were introduced singly (experiment 1) to assess the costs and benefits associated with defence and in tandem (experiment 2) to assess how individuals prioritize perceived threats. Dominant breeders defended more than subordinate helpers, females were more aggressive than males, and female breeders defended more than any other individual in the group. Individual body size, or the difference in body size between intruders and defenders, had no influence on the frequency of defence. Dominant male breeders defended most vigorously against threats to their dominance position, while dominant female breeders showed the highest defence rates to both threats to their position and the security of young to a similar degree relative to all others. Predators evoked the strongest defence responses by subordinate helpers, and conspecific intruders evoked the weakest responses relative to all other intruder types.

We tested our systems in a pair of experiments: the first assessed the effects of ground cover on predation of key pests in blueberries, and the second investigated predator activity in corn and perennial prairie systems. We identified ants as the most frequent predators in all three ecosystems, with notable activity from arachnids, crickets, and mollusks. Interactions between coleopterans and prey were surprisingly infrequent in all three agroecosystems. Ants were observed under both day and night conditions, while other predators were primarily nocturnal. Ground covers did not significantly affect predator activity in blueberries, but there was a numerical reduction in ant activity on woodchips and weed barrier compared to grass and bare ground. The predator complex observed in blueberry video footage differed considerably from pitfall captures at the same site. In corn fields, prey mortality significantly increased with ant activity, and high prey mortality was associated with long interactions that involved large numbers of ant foragers.

The wild boar (Sus scrofa) is one of the most common mammals in Europe and has notably expanded its distribution range in recent decades. The present work aimed to investigate the possible effect of wild boar rooting activity on butterflies in olive groves inside the Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni National Park. Butterflies were surveyed in five Rooted (R) and five Control areas (C). Transects were made from April to September in 2011 and 2012. Forty-three species and 3659 individuals were found, of which 39 species and 2426 individuals were detected in C areas and 31 species and 1233 individuals in R areas. A community-level approach showed a significantly higher abundance, richness and Shannon-Wiener index in C than in R. An ecological-level approach indicated that more specialised butterflies were significantly more affected by wild boar activity. Finally, the response of single species was investigated: two species (Colias croceus and Polyommatus icarus) were significantly more represented in R, whereas six species (Aricia agestis, Hipparchia statilinus, Lasiommata megera, Melanargia arge, Pyronia cecilia and Thymelicus acteon) were significantly more abundant in C. Three species considered at risk (M. arge; Annex II of Directive 92/43/EEC; H. statilinus and T. acteon: European Red List) were less represented in rooted areas. Overall, the intensive wild boar activity negatively correlated with butterflies in the olive groves studied."

MeSA is commercially sold as slow-release lures or as a spray. While MeSA application has increased the abundance of natural enemies in numerous food crops, its ability to reduce pests for crop protection is not as frequently demonstrated. Our first objective was to test MeSA lures in ornamental fields where few studies have been done, and monitor natural enemies, pests, and crop protection. A 2-year study in spruce container yards revealed more aphid parasitoids (Pseudopraon sp.), fewer aphids (Mindarus obliquus) on shoot tips, and less shoot tip damage in MeSA plots during the first year. A 2-year study in red maple fields revealed more predatory lady beetles and rove beetles, and parasitic Ceraphronidae, Diapriidae, and Chalcidoidea in one or both years with MeSA. Fewer pest thrips were also captured in MeSA plots, though it is not clear whether this was due to enhanced predation or reduced colonization. Maple growth as measured by stem diameter change did not differ with MeSA use. A 2-year study examining predation on sentinel Halyomorpha halys eggs in various mature ornamental stock blocks found no increase in predation except for 1 month, though green lacewings, lady beetles, and predatory thrips occurred more in MeSA plots in the first year. While MeSA is expected to enhance biological control by herding in natural enemies, the impacts that applied volatiles have on predator efficiency is mostly unknown. Thus, our second objective examined how volatiles would impact feeding rates at close-range. Adult carabid Pterostichus melanarius, adult coccinellids Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis, and larval lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris consumed their prey at similar rates in the presence/absence of MeSA when food was presented directly in a 28 cm(2) or 30 ml arena, or when foraging in a 520 cm(2) outdoor soil arena or 946 ml arena with aphids on leaves."

The formation and intensity of UHIs can be influenced not only by the type of land cover, but also by other factors, such as the spatial patterns of thermal clusters (e.g., dimensions, contiguity, and integration). By emphasising the differences between semi-arid and cold-and-humid climates in terms of the thermal-spatial behaviours of various types of land cover in these climates, this paper aims to assess the behavioural patterns of thermal clusters in Tehran, Iran. To this end, the relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and the types of land cover is first demonstrated using combined multispectral satellite images taken by Operational Land Imager (OLI), Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) of the Landsat8 and MODIS, and Sentinel satellites to determine LST and land cover. The effects of different behavioural patterns of thermal clusters on the formation of daytime urban heat islands are then analysed through spatial cross-correlation analysis. Lastly, the thermal behaviours of each cluster are separately examined to reveal how their spatial patterns, such as contiguity, affect the intensity and formation of UHI, with the assumption that each point in a contiguous surface may exhibit different thermal behaviours, depending on its distance from the edge or centre. The results of this study show that the daytime UHIs do not occur in the central parts of Tehran, and instead they are created in the surrounding layer, which mostly consists of barren cover. This finding contrasts with previous research conducted regarding cities located in cold-and-humid climates. Our research also finds that the more compact the hot and cool clusters are, the more contiguous they become, which leads to an increase in UHIs. The results suggest that for every 100 pix/km(2) increase, the cluster temperature increases by approximately 0.7-1 degrees C. Additionally, placing cool clusters near or in combination with hot clusters interrupts the effect of the hot clusters, leading to a significant temperature reduction. The paper concludes with recommendations for potential sustainable and context-based solutions to UHI problems in semi-arid climates that relate to the determination of the optimal contiguity distance and land use integration patterns for thermal clusters."

Complementarity in resource use involves spatial or temporal segregation of predators, which can result in better biological control when several species of natural enemies share a prey. In this study, we investigated the seasonal, spatial and diel segregation of Acyrthosiphon pisum predators and its predation in alfalfa fields, by setting out cards with sentinel aphids, and making observations every 3 h for a 24 h period. A temporal and spatial segregation of predators was observed. Coccinellids were the most abundant predators, representing 51% of the total observations, followed by syrphid larvae. Coccinellids were also responsible for high levels of predation throughout the year, although the species responsible varied from spring to summer and autumn. On the other hand, syrphids were only found in spring and summer, while spiders only in autumn. Predator species also differed on their preferred sites for predation, with Heteropterans and syrphids found on the foliage, the spider Neomaso articeps only on the ground, and coccinellid and Anyphaenidae species on both sites. The two main predator groups also showed distinct diel patterns, with coccinellids observed only during day and syrphids only during night. This predatory activity corresponded with aphid predation, observing more predation in spring, on the foliage and during the day time. The proportion of predators observed preying on cards in the different seasons did not corresponded tightly with their field abundance, particularly in the case of coccinellids, which maintained high levels of predation in spite of great variations in its field abundance. Our results support the hypothesis of a spatio-temporal segregation of the predators associated with A. pisum in alfalfa, which might be beneficial for the outcome of biological control of this pest.

In these environments, complex species interactions could promote the evolution of acoustic signals and result in intriguing patterns of mimicry and convergence. In the Neotropical region, Neomorphus ground-cuckoos frequently associate with herds of collared peccaries and white-lipped peccaries. Bill clacking behavior in ground-cuckoos closely resembles the sound of teeth clacking in peccaries and these acoustic signals are used in agonistic and foraging contexts in both species. Here we demonstrate that the acoustic characteristics of bill clacking in ground-cuckoos are more similar to teeth clacking of peccaries than to bill clacking of the more closely related Geococcyx roadrunner. We propose that two hypotheses may explain the evolution of the clacking behavior in these taxa. First, because peccaries are known to successfully ward off attacks from large predators to defend their herds, mimicking their clacking can deceive predators, either by triggering clacking from nearby peccaries, or making it appear to the predators that peccaries are present when they are not. Second, ground-cuckoos and peccaries could mutually benefit from the use of similar signals to alert each other of the presence of predators. In this context, ground-cuckoos could serve as sentinels while peccaries could confer protection. We also discuss alternative explanations for this striking acoustic resemblance. Ground-cuckoos and peccaries provide an interesting opportunity to study how an ecological association could foster the evolution of acoustic mimicry."

The colony is located along a river terrace near the south entrance of Yellowstone National Park. The home-burrow is where the young are reared, where an animal normally spends the night, and where an animal goes when an alarm call is given. Auxiliary burrows are used temporarily as a place of refuge. The burrows are connected by a trail system that directs the movements of the animals. The distribution of adults and litters indicated a preference for burrows in the central part of the colony. Patterns of home range were of three types, those with no overlap, those with slight overlap and those with major overlap. Animals which utilized the same home range frequently avoided one another. The shape of the home range depended primarily on the nearness of the feeding area. Agonistic behavior modified both size and shape of home ranges. Changes in home range from year to year were correlated with changes in the individuals occupying home-burrows. The animals emerged from their burrows at about sunrise, had a morning peak of activity, a midday low and a second peak of activity in the late afternoon. All entered their burrows by 30 minutes after sunset. Communication between marmots involved the senses of sight, smell, touch, and, most importantly, hearing. The alarm call was given in response to any kind of intrusion into the life of the colony. No particular animal acted as a sentinel. Olfactory communication consisted of the greeting in which two animals sniffed each other's cheeks. One or two animals were dominant. Several tended to be submissive to all with which they had contact. Other relationships seem best characterized by a kind of neutrality in which each of the two animals avoids the other. Territorial behavior does not seem to occur in the yellow-bellied marmot. Hibernation began in the second week of August. Conflicts and alert calls were less numerous and activity in general greatly decreased. Increased wandering was shown by some adults. Agonistic behavior may be one of the factors that limits the number of marmots on a colony site. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author"

There is no storage of sperm in female tracts prior to ovulation but epididymal sperm storage persists beyond the time of birth (late spring). Male, but not female, readiness to initiate reproduction prior to the onset of winter, places this species in an 'intermediate' position with features of both temperate and tropical chiropteran reproductive cycle patterns. The presence of an extroverted corpus luteum in the female and of a complement of accessory sex organs in the male are normal glandular features for members of this chiropteran family. The role of the urethral gland is unknown; however, since there is no vaginal plug, its products apparently do not coagulate in the vagina in this species following insemination."

The sex ratio, mean size of each sex at first sexual maturation, and female fecundity were determined and the reproductive period was characterized. The males:females ratio was 1:2. The fecundity is low and increases proportionally to the females' growth in total length and weight. The breeding season occurs during the wannest months of the year, with spawning extending from October through March and incubation from December through April. Sexual maturation is late, with males maturing at a larger size than females. Skipping spawning was also identified in females.

Local environmental factors which affect choice of scent-marking sites in a population of wild klipspringers in Zimbabwe are described. Scent marks were typically placed within a narrow vertical range at the end of upward-pointing twigs. Twigs were more likely to be selected if they were located above bare rock, particularly if the ground was raised above the immediately surrounding area or was close to a significant break in slope. A substantial proportion of sites were placed on dead wood. Marking sites may remain in use for a number of years, with turnover rates calculated at between 1 and 2% per annum. The species of tree on which marks were placed were recorded and compared with overall abundance in the habitat. Palatable tree species were found to be selected preferentially when compared to unpalatable ones. Several explanations for this are compared. It is concluded that, simply through preferential selection of certain local characteristics, klipspringers may enhance the visibility and predictability of their scent marks."

Several predators in turfgrass systems attack lepidopteran larvae; however, their predaceous activity is rarely recorded, as they leave hardly any evidence. Predaceous activity can be studied using clay models, an approach still rarely employed in turfgrass. Thus, assays were conducted to determine the types of impressions that common turfgrass arthropods leave on clay models simulating lepidopteran larvae. Nine impression types were characterized after exposing 16 arthropod taxa in enclosed arenas in the laboratory and one taxon in the field to two sizes of clay models, including scratches, paired marks, pricks, deep distortions, disturbed surfaces, detached segments, granulated surfaces, dents, and elongated scratches. Most arthropods produced scratches and paired marks, whereas granulated surfaces and elongated scratches were produced by only a few of the selected arthropods. To ensure that the impressions were correctly identified, non-expert volunteers reviewed the impressions, and they were accurately identified in >85% of the responses. Video recordings of arthropod interactions were captured to determine the behavior of the arthropods during their first interaction with the clay models. Most arthropods first interacted with the terminal rather than the middle regions of the models. There were no differences between their interactions with the large or small models, and they used their mouthparts as often as their legs. Knowledge of the impression types caused by common arthropods will improve the utilization of the clay model technique for field studies in turfgrass. This could contribute to improved management of natural enemies as part of an integrated pest management approach."

Guarding coverage was 13.7 +/- 4.2% of total observation time during the pre-laying period, 6.8 +/- 2.2% of observation time in the incubation period, and 26.3 +/- 3.2% of observation time in the nestling period.

Although males were present only 51.2 +/- 2.8% of the nestling period, male breeders guarded nests twice as often as females. Adults guarded most often from perches in adjacent trees and within 25 m of the nest. If increasing rates of conspecific interactions force males to allocate more time to nest guarding, a tradeoff may occur, with males dividing time between guarding the nest and foraging for food to provision offspring."

We evaluated effects of disturbance on the eastern migratory monarch butterfly (Denaus plexippus L.), which has declined markedly in recent decades, primarily attributed to the loss of milkweed host plants from annual crop fields in the US Midwest. Currently, remaining milkweeds in this region primarily occur in perennial grasslands, where disturbance is infrequent, predatory arthropods are abundant, and seasonal patterns of plant phenology differ from crop fields. In a two-year study in Michigan, USA, we applied three treatments to 23 patches of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.); one-third of each patch was left undisturbed, while the remaining thirds were mowed in either mid-June or mid-July, respectively, and allowed to regenerate. We subsequently measured effects on monarch oviposition, predator abundance, survival of sentinel eggs and larvae, and tested how milkweed phenology and aphid colonization-both of which are reset by disturbance-structure predation risk for immature monarchs. Monarchs laid more eggs on regenerating versus undisturbed stems under both mowing regimes. Predators were strongly suppressed by mowing treatments, requiring 2-4 weeks to recolonize milkweed after disturbance, and were more abundant on flowering or aphid-infested stems. We found no significant differences in monarch egg/larval survival, although it tended to be higher in mowed plots. Overall, monarchs laid more eggs on regenerating stems where their offspring may also experience enemy-free space. Future work should focus on testing grassland disturbance as a management tool to improve productivity of existing monarch breeding habitat."

Availability of suitable habitat is important for flying migrants, and in particular for large birds that use the energetically expensive flapping flight mode, such as the Bewick's Swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii). Bewick's Swans largely feed on aquatic macrophytes during migration that may disappear when nutrient levels, waves, and turbidity exceed certain thresholds. Macrophyte collapse has been suggested as a reason for the sharp decline of the Bewick's Swan population during 1995-2015. We used Bewick's Swans fitted with GPS/GSM neck collars including an accelerometer and water sensor to record the occurrence of aquatic foraging in remote stopovers along their migratory route. We concentrated on spring migration, when stopovers are longer than during autumn, and focused on four key sites identified in earlier tracking studies. Within these sites, we identified areas that are protected based on the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). During three years (2017-2019), we obtained a total of 51 complete spring tracks of adult female Bewick's Swans. Most swans showed aquatic foraging along the coast of Estonia and in Dvina Bay, and about half in the Gulf of Finland and Cheskaya Bay. In Estonia and in the Gulf of Finland, swans predominantly used protected zones, but in Dvina Bay swans also foraged extensively in areas that are currently not protected according to WDPA. No protected areas occur in Cheskaya Bay. Macrophyte vegetation is threatened by ongoing or planned construction works in the Gulf of Finland and Dvina Bay, and by future oil and gas exploitation in Cheskaya Bay. Our study shows how migrants can be used as sentinels to pinpoint areas that require protection in order to maintain a chain of suitable stopovers on their migration."

Females chew a small hole into the fruit, deposit a single egg within the cavity, and seal the hole with a clear anal secretion that hardens into an 'oviposition plug'. Female oviposition behavior was studied in a series of small-arena bioassays to determine whether previous oviposition in Jalapeno pepper fruit deterred subsequent oviposition and to determine what specific cues from an infested fruit influence female behavior. In choice and no-choice tests, females preferred clean fruit to fruit that had received four eggs 24 h previously (i.e., infested fruit), whether the fruit was infested with conspecific eggs or their own eggs. Further bioassays demonstrated that the presence of female frass, or oviposition plugs alone, in the absence of eggs or any fruit damage, was sufficient to deter oviposition. In addition, females given the choice between an infested fruit with the oviposition plug removed or an unaltered infested fruit preferred the fruit with no plugs, even when eggs, frass, and feeding damage were still present. To determine whether females would avoid infested peppers under more natural conditions, we quantified oviposition on infested and uninfested sentinel pepper fruit within individually caged plants and on clean and infested plants caged together. Females consistently laid more eggs on clean fruit than on infested fruits and moved within and among pepper plants to search for more acceptable oviposition sites. We conclude that oviposition plugs, along with contaminated female, but not male, frass contain a deterrent that, in the absence of any other cue, is enough to alert a female that a patch is occupied."

At the same time, the transmission cycles of most mosquito-borne pathogens (e.g. viruses or filarial parasites) are not completely understood. There is especially a lack of knowledge about the vector capacity of the different mosquito species, which is strongly influenced by their host-feeding patterns. While this kind of information is important to identify the relevant vector species, e.g. to direct efficient control measures, studies about the host-feeding patterns of mosquito species in Germany are scarce and outdated. Methods: Between 2012 and 2015, 775 blood-fed mosquito specimens were collected. Sampling was conducted with Heavy Duty Encephalitis Vector Survey traps, Biogents Sentinel traps, gravid traps, hand-held aspirators, sweep nets, and human-bait collection. The host species for each mosquito specimen was identified with polymerase chain reactions and subsequent Sanger sequencing of the cytochrome b gene. Results: A total of 32 host species were identified for 23 mosquito species, covering 21 mammalian species (including humans) and eleven bird species. Three mosquito species accounted for nearly three quarters of all collected blood-fed mosquitoes: Aedes vexans (363 specimens, 46.8 % of all mosquito specimens), Culex pipiens pipiens form pipiens (100, 12.9 %) and Ochlerotatus cantans (99, 12.8 %). Non-human mammals dominated the host species (572 specimens, 73.8 % of all mosquito specimens), followed by humans (152, 19.6 %) and birds (51, 6.6 %). The most common host species were roe deer (Capreolus capreolus; 258 mosquito specimens, 33.3 % of all mosquito specimens, 65 % of all mosquito species), humans (Homo sapiens; 152, 19.6 %, 90 %), cattle (Bos taurus; 101, 13.0 %, 60 %), and wild boar (Sus scrofa; 116, 15.0 %, 50 %). There were no statistically significant differences in the spatial-temporal host-feeding patterns of the three most common mosquito species. Conclusions: Although the collected blood-fed mosquito species had a strong overlap of host species, two different host-feeding groups were identified with mosquito species feeding on (i) non-human mammals and humans or (ii) birds, non-human mammals, and humans, which make them potential vectors of pathogens only between mammals or between mammals and birds, respectively. Due to the combination of their host-feeding patterns and wide distribution in Germany, Cx. pipiens pipiens form pipiens and Cx. torrentium are potentially most important vectors for pathogens transmitted from birds to humans and the species Ae. vexans for pathogens transmitted from non-human mammals to humans. Finally, the presented study indicated a much broader host range compared to the classifications found in the literature for some of the species, which highlights the need for studies on the host-feeding patterns of mosquitoes to further assess their vector capacity and the disease ecology in Europe."

Black Oystercatchers preferred abalone of 50 mm, smaller than the mean size available, in contrast to the selection of larger-than-average prey, typical for other prey species.

The Northern Abalone has never been reported as prey of the Black Oystercatcher despite its high vulnerability to predation at low tides. We speculate that the recent inclusion of the Northern Abalone in the Black Oystercatcher diet on Haida Gwaii may indicate a greater abundance of Northern Abalone than in other regions of its distribution. The frequency of the oystercatcher's feeding on abalone was unexpected because under Canada's Species at Risk Act, the Northern Abalone was listed as endangered in 2010, after the population continued to decline after legal protection from harvest in 1990."

Earth Observation (EO) is a valuable data source for detecting exposed soils on a large scale. In the last couple of years, the multitemporal compositing technique has been used for the generation of so-called exposed soil composites that overcome the limitation of temporarily coverage of the soils with vegetation as it is occurring at agricultural sites. The selection of exposed soil pixels from the stack of multispectral images is mainly done using spectral reflectance indices such as NDVI, NBR2 and others calculated on a per-pixel basis. The definition of the thresholds that are applicable to large areas such as regions, countries or continents is still a challenge and requires a reliable and robust sampling data base. In this study, the Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) is used to build exposed soil masks containing all pixels in a given time period showing at least once exposed soil. For this purpose, a modified vegetation index (PV) based on the NDVI is used to separate the soils from other land cover (LC) classes by two PV thresholds. The overall goal of this study is to derive and validate exposed soil masks from multi-year Landsat data stacks for Germany from 1984 to 2019. The first focus is set on the impact of a newly developed sampling approach of LC classes such as urban areas, deciduous forests and agricultural fields that are automatically derived from Corine Land Cover (CLC) data. The spectral-temporal behavior of these LC classes in PVmin/ max index composites show larger variability of the PV values compared to a manual sampling for selective LC classes such as urban areas. It reveals that the threshold definition method previously developed by Rogge et al. (2018) is not robust enough and the percentile rule used to define the Tmax threshold had to be adapted from 0.995 to 0.900. On the other hand, the sampling data base has proven to be robust across time and region. The second focus of the paper is to validate all generated exposed soil masks covering Germany for seven time periods from 1984 to 2019. A linear correlation analysis was performed comparing the SCMaP data with surveys from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) and the CLC inventories. The comparison with both datasets showed high regression coefficients (R2 = 0.79 to 0.90) with small regional deviations for areas in the Northern part of Germany. Strong correlation was found for time periods based on a higher number of cloud free Landsat images such as from 2000 to 2009. This demonstrates the high potential of SCMaP's to generate exposed soil masks based on an automated sampling and a robust threshold derivation. To contribute to soil erosion studies that need information about where and when soils are bare, accurate exposed soil masks in suitable time periods can be of great value."

Red-billed oxpeckers (Buphagus erythrorhynchus) are just such an example of an adaptive story. These small birds feed almost exclusively on what they can glean from the skin of large African mammals. The relationship is obligate for the birds, and it is generally assumed that hosts benefit through a reduction in tick load. Although widely accepted in the literature, this theory has never been tested in the field. I excluded oxpeckers from cattle as part of a controlled field experiment in Zimbabwe to test this idea. Changes in adult tick loads were unaffected by excluding the birds. In addition, oxpeckers significantly prolonged the healing time of wounds and removed earwax. These results suggest that the oxpecker-mammal relationship is more complex than was previously thought."

This represents an excellent opportunity to investigate and improve our understanding of the behavior of extremely slow landslides, as well as of the long- to short-term controls of their activity. In urban settings, such landslides deserve special attention, as their cumulative movements can cause significant socio-economic damage. Here, we re-examine the case of a long-lived, deep-seated landslide in the Apennine Mountains (Italy) which was urbanized between the late 1970s and early 2000s. The case provides a rare opportunity to highlight the benefits of the integrated analysis of long-term (several years) borehole inclinometer measurements with 15 years of multi-temporal InSAR displacement data. We present evidence of the landslide composite nature and asymmetry, and draw attention to the recent period of accelerated movement that coincided with the foot failure event. This helps constraining the interpretation of the borehole and InSAR data and demonstrating the predominantly rotational landslide mechanism. We show how a detailed analysis of sparse inclinometer and more spatially continuous InSAR measurements, when combined with local rainfall records, can reveal long- to short-term patterns of temporal variability in landslide motions and allow anticipating the consequences of future landslide activity."

Previous studies revealed that the predation pressure provided by carabids significantly regulates the ecological network of invertebrates. Nevertheless, there is no direct estimation of the predation risk on carabids, which can be an important proxy for the phenomenon called ecological trap. In our study, we aimed to explore the predation pressure on carabids using 3D-printed decoys installed in two types of forestry treatments, preparation cuts and clear cuts, and control plots in a Hungarian oak-hornbeam forest. We estimated the seasonal, diurnal and treatment-specific aspects of the predation pressure on carabids. Our results reveal a significantly higher predation risk on carabids in both forestry treatments than in the control. Moreover, it was also higher in the nighttime than daytime. Contrarily, no effects of season and microhabitat features were found. Based on these clues we assume that habitats modified by forestry practices may act as an ecological trap for carabids. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how ecological interactions between species may change in a modified forest environment."

This may be due to differences in the biology of local Anopheles gambiae, the only vector on the islands. Survival rate and feeding frequency are two factors influencing vectorial capacity. Anophelines generally feed just once per gonotrophic (oviposition) cycle. Newly emerged insects, however, may feed two or more times during their first oviposition cycle thus increasing the likelihood of becoming infected. The reasons for multiple feeding are not clearly understood and it is still uncertain whether the behaviour is facultative or obligatory. We, therefore, determined survival and sporozoite rates, and examined the behaviour of An. gambiae from the two islands during their first gonotrophic cycle. Methods: The wing size of 1,410, abdominal condition of 687, gonotrophic age and mated status of 7,264 female M form An. gambiae collected by light-trap, landing catch, resting outdoors or in copula, was determined from four sites in the archipelago. Sporozoite rates assessed by ELISA in 15,533 females from Sao Tome and 2,111 from Principe were determined. Results: Estimated survival rates ranged between 0.834-0.849 per day in Sao Tome and 0.801- 0.818 per day in Principe. Sporozoite rates of 0.63% in Sao Tome were significantly higher than the 0.24% from Principe. Overall 49% of females mated on the second night after emergence before feeding, and 51% on the third night and thus fed before mating. The likelihood of mating before feeding increased with wing size. None of the 3,776 parous insects collected showed evidence of recent mating. All but two of the 198 females collected in copula had undeveloped ovaries. Mean wing sizes and the number of insects collected in a sentinel light-trap varied but the proportion of newly emerged insects in the collection did not. The estimated survival rate of the smallest insects was lower than other size groups, but the overall size distribution of each age group was normal. Parous insects were gonotrophically concordant. Conclusion: Differences in mosquito survival contributed to the lower sporozoite rates and endemicity of malaria on Principe compared to Sao Tome. On both islands all newly emerged insects blood fed on the second night following emergence but only became gonotrophically active on the third night after emergence. Smaller insects had a higher 'mortality/emigration' rate than larger ones. We suggest that insufficiency of Juvenile Hormone until the third day of adult life is responsible for gonotrophic inactivity and that by partitioning mating between the second or thirdday after emergence females maximise their chances of out-crossing."

Although these vocalizations may be a source of information for heterospecifics, it remains largely unknown how heterospecifics respond to mobbing calls given by group-living species. In this study, we investigate whether the mobbing calls given by Western Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen dorsalis) lead to the recruitment of heterospecifics. By presenting a taxidermied red fox (Vulpes vulpes)-representing a terrestrial predator threat-to a population of magpies and heterospecific species occupying the same area, we demonstrate that magpie calls given in response to a terrestrial predator recruit heterospecifics to the mobbing event. Heterospecifics are more likely to approach and engage in mobbing behavior when the predator is associated with magpie presence than when magpies are absent. We found that larger magpie groups produced more alarm calls than did smaller groups, but we found no evidence that group size affected heterospecific recruitment to the mobbing site. Therefore, the occurrence of magpie alarm calls, rather than the number of individuals giving alarm calls, seems to be the primary predictor of heterospecific recruitment to a mobbing site. Moreover, we used a playback experiment to test if heterospecifics responded more to single-magpie mobbing alarm calls than to single mobbing alarm calls given by a non-social species (red wattlebird, Anthochaera carunculata). We found that heterospecifics responded more to the playbacks of magpie than to red wattlebird alarm calls. Our study therefore suggests that Australian magpies may play a central role as information sources for heterospecific species during predator detection and mobbing events. Significance statement Mobbing-when individuals move toward and vocalize or harass a predator-is a good example of interspecific communication. Loud vocalizations produced during mobbing behavior have been known to not only modify the behavior of the predator but to also recruit individuals to the mobbing event from a variety of different species. Although the response to heterospecific mobbing calls is becoming well documented, it remains largely unknown how heterospecifics respond to the mobbing calls of group-living species, even though these species can provide significant benefits for heterospecific species sharing the same habitat (via increased vigilance and predator detection rates for example). By presenting a predator model and using a series of playback experiments, we demonstrate that group-living Western Australian magpies may play a central role as information sources during predator detection and mobbing events."

An individual of a prey species is assumed to benefit from an increase in the number of group members by reducing its own investment in vigilance. However, the proximate mechanism generating the decrease in vigilance with increasing group size is unclear. Most models of this relation assume that either individuals coordinate their scans in nonoverlapping bouts of vigilance or animals scan independently of one another. We studied the relation between vigilance and group size in the eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus, analysing vigilance at two structural levels, individual vigilance and collective vigilance of the group. We tested both assumptions, coordination and independence of scanning. The time that an individual spent vigilant decreased with group size. However, the time during which at least one individual in the group scanned the environment (collective vigilance) increased up to a group size of seven individuals but decreased thereafter. Analyses revealed that individuals neither coordinated their scanning in an asynchronous way nor scanned independently of one another. On the contrary, both the onset and the end of individuals' scanning bouts were synchronized between group members, producing waves of collective vigilance. Bouts of vigilance and nonvigilance activity tended to be synchronized. Our results appear to support a hypothesis of allelomimetic vigilance.

One of these functions, regulation of herbivorous insects by predators, shapes tropical communities through cascading trophic effects. An improved understanding of how predation pressure on herbivorous insects varies with reforestation strategy, management decisions, and landscape context would guide restoration practice. We measured predation pressure by birds and arthropods on dummy caterpillars in five forest types in Panama. These land covers represent natural and managed forest conditions: non-native monoculture plantation, native multispecies plantation, young natural forest succession, secondary gallery forest, and old-growth forest. We also placed dummy caterpillars in residential countryside, a heavily disturbed nonforest land cover. In three land covers, we surveyed bird communities to examine the relationship between predator abundance and predation pressure. Predation pressure from birds was lowest in the intensively managed plantations and highest in land covers with structurally complex vegetation: successional forest, gallery forest, and residential countryside. In the non-native plantation, bird predation increased with proximity to gallery forest. We found strong correspondence between bird abundance and bird attacks on dummy caterpillars. Arthropod predation pressure was highest in the native plantation but, unlike bird predation pressure, did not vary strongly by land cover. Our results suggest that ecosystem functions by insectivorous birds can be enhanced on reforestation lands by incorporating unmanaged areas and tolerating nonplanted understory vegetation. We recommend that, regardless of management objectives, forest managers adopt a holistic approach to reforestation to facilitate recovery of animal-dependent ecosystem functions."

Yet, the strength of natural enemy pressure along an altitudinal gradient and interactions between the groups of natural enemies (such as predation on parasitized prey) are not well known. Various methods are used to reveal the mortality factors of herbivores. Predation pressure is usually assessed through exposure of artificial prey. However, this method cannot provide information about the attacks of parasitoids, or their eventual interactions with predators. Furthermore, artificial or dead prey might not attract predators because they do not show expected host behavior, and this method mostly cannot distinguish between predation and scavenging. For the first time in a tropical rainforest, we quantified elevational contrast in mortality factors using exposure of live caterpillars. We exposed a total of 800 live caterpillars of Talanga excelsalis moresbyensis Strand (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) on saplings of Ficus copiosa Steud. (Moraceae) at two elevations in primary tropical rain forest in Papua New Guinea (200 and 1 200 m a.s.l.). We exposed the caterpillars in two treatments: exposed to and protected from invertebrate predators and parasitoids. Disappearance of caterpillars was significantly higher in the exposed treatment. Furthermore, caterpillar disappearance was significantly higher in lowlands than in highlands (43 vs. 12%). We consider the vast majority of the disappearance to be due to predation, as migration of the caterpillars from the focal trees was not observed (except one caterpillar). This estimate of invertebrate predation rate corresponds with studies which used artificial caterpillar models. No significant difference in parasitism rate between the two elevations was observed (12 vs. 13%). The combination of the disappearance and parasitism rate patterns means that larval parasitoids face stronger pressure from invertebrate predators through higher predation of their hosts in the lowlands than in the highlands."

This stock is currently under a three-year management cycle, and the current assessment provided catch advice for 2016-18. The assessment also identified an indicator (based on 3 year projections of DFO research vessel (RV) total (2+) biomass) that could be used to determine whether a full assessment is warranted during interim years. The current assessment was based mainly on a new state-space population dynamics model (Northern Cod Assessment Model, NCAM) that integrates much of the existing information about the productivity of the stock. Key features of the new model are that it provides annual estimates of natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) rates along with measures of uncertainty; the model also estimates catch and requires an interval identifying a likely range of catch (upper and lower bounds). The model integrates information from DFO RV autumn trawl surveys (1983-2015), Sentinel fishery surveys (1995-2014), inshore acoustic surveys (1995-2009) fishery catch age compositions, and partial fishery landings (1983-2015), and tagging (1983-2015). The latest assessment indicated that stock abundance (ages 2+) has increased from 194 million cod in 2005 to 894 million in 2015. Total biomass (ages 2+) has increased from 78 Kt in 2005 to 539 Kt in 2015. Spawning stock biomass (SSB) has increased from 25 Kt in 2005 to 300 Kt in 2015. Recruitment (age 2) improved slightly in the last decade and the average number of age 2s from the 2011-13 year classes corresponds to about 25% of the numbers of age 2s observed in year classes of the 1980s. Stock status is improving, increasing from 3% of Blim in 2005 to 34% of Blim in 2015, but SSB has been well into the critical zone since the stock collapse. Three year projections (to 2018) were also undertaken to investigate the potential impact of a range of catch options from zero catch (no fishing) to a 5-fold increase in catch, based on model estimates of total catch for 2015 (6,900 t). The results indicated a high probability of achieving a 3-year 28% SSB interim growth milestone over the full range of catch options. Projections also indicate a low risk (<4%) that SSB will decline by 2018 to below the 2015 value, but also a low probability (5-8%) that the stock will grow out of the critical zone and exceed Blim in 2018. The stock is projected to grow but still be much less than Blim (60-66%) and remain in the critical zone in 2018 over the full range of catch options considered, including no fishing. Consistency with the DFO decision-making framework incorporating the precautionary approach requires that removals from all sources must be kept at the lowest possible level until the stock clears the critical zone."

The results of our experiment support that the alarms of the two species of antwrens elicit a significant response from both species of antshrikes. Our model also shows that the responses of antshrikes to antwrens' alarms are indistinguishable from their response to conspecific alarms, yet different from a control (Marginal R-2 = 0.36, Conditional R-2 = 0.37). This suggests that highly social flock-leading species such as Thamnomanes antshrikes may benefit from the information provided by flock mates regarding predators. Furthermore, these patterns are consistent with eavesdropping interactions observed within mixed-flocks in ecologically similar but geographically distant forests."

However, an effect of sex on collective vigilance is less often studied (and therefore rarely predicted), despite being relevant to any consideration of the adaptiveness of mixed vs single-sex grouping. Controlling for group size, we studied the effect of sex on vigilance in the sexually dimorphic eastern grey kangaroo Macropus giganteus, analysing vigilance at two structural levels: individual vigilance and the group's collective vigilance. Knowing that group members in this species tend to synchronise their bouts of vigilance, we tested (for the first time) whether sex affects the degree of synchrony between group members. We found that females were individually more vigilant than males and that their vigilance rate was unaffected by the presence of males. Collective vigilance did not differ between female-only and mixed-sex groups of the same size. Vigilance in mixed-sex groups was neither more nor less synchronous than in single-sex groups of females, and the presence of males seemed not to affect the degree of synchrony between females. Sixty-six percent of vigilant acts were unique (performed when no other kangaroo was alert), and only about one unique vigilant act in every three induced a collective wave of vigilance. The proportions of vigilant acts that were unique were 60% for females but only 46% for males. However, the sexes differed little in the rates at which their unique vigilant acts were copied. This limited study shows that the differences in vigilance between male and female kangaroos had no discernible effect upon collective vigilance."

Relatively suitable aquifers have been formed in complex formations in northwest Shahrood due to the presence of carbonate rocks as well as erosion and tectonic forces in the region. This study aims to identify and separate the calcareous formations that can form karst aquifers in the study area. As a result of erosion and tectonic forces, the rocks of the region exhibit spectral fluctuations, making it difficult for mapping geological formations using multispectral images. Therefore, Landsat 8 satellite-based images were processed by adopting the minimum noise fraction (MNF), independent component analysis (ICA), and band ratio (BR). The indices of calcareous formations and shale formations were created by the BR through the spectral behavior of pure pixels. Moreover, the support vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood (ML) were employed for classification. The SVM classifier proved more capable of classification than the ML classifier, and the transform ICA outperformed the MNF in the separation of formations. The lithological maps were extracted using the SVM with an overall accuracy (OA) of 68.04%. Furthermore, a method decision tree (DT) was employed to improve the classification accuracy. The DT classifier was then utilized to reclassify lithological maps that were classified by SVM and ML through morphological characteristics and indices of formations The DT classifier improved the lithological map accuracy by 10%. The boundaries of calcareous formations were extracted from non-calcareous formations with an accuracy of 93%, and the regional constructions were separated with an accuracy of similar to 80%. Finally, the lithological map was developed with a kappa of 0.734 and an OA of 78.59%. (C) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)"

We aimed to describe travel-related health problems in business travelers.Methods: GeoSentinel Surveillance Network consists of 64 travel and tropical medicine clinics in 29 countries; descriptive analysis was performed on ill business travelers, defined as persons traveling for work, evaluated after international travel 1 January 1997 through 31 December 2014.Results: Among 12 203 business travelers seen 1997-2014 (14 045 eligible diagnoses), the majority (97%) were adults aged 20-64 years; most (74%) reported from Western Europe or North America; two-thirds were male. Most (86%) were outpatients. Fewer than half (45%) reported a pre-travel healthcare encounter. Frequent regions of exposure were sub-Saharan Africa (37%), Southeast Asia (15%) and South Central Asia (14%). The most frequent diagnoses were malaria (9%), acute unspecified diarrhea (8%), viral syndrome (6%), acute bacterial diarrhea (5%) and chronic diarrhea (4%). Species was reported for 973 (90%) of 1079 patients with malaria, predominantly Plasmodium falciparum acquired in sub-Saharan Africa. Of 584 (54%) with malaria chemoprophylaxis information, 92% took none or incomplete courses. Thirteen deaths were reported, over half of which were due to malaria; others succumbed to pneumonia, typhoid fever, rabies, melioidosis and pyogenic abscess.Conclusions: Diarrheal illness was a major cause of morbidity. Malaria contributed substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly among business travelers to sub-Saharan Africa. Underuse or non-use of chemoprophylaxis contributed to malaria cases. Deaths in business travelers could be reduced by improving adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis and targeted vaccination for vaccine-preventable diseases. Pre-travel advice is indicated for business travelers and is currently under-utilized and needs improvement."

Population dynamics and selection pressures will depend on the identity of dominant predators in the system, and these may vary substantially among habitats. Arthropods emerge as chief predators on caterpillars in the understorey of non-montane tropical forest, whereas birds dominate elsewhere. In a tropical forest in Uganda, Africa, we evaluated marks on dummy caterpillars that differed in size, material (clay vs. dough), colourant, and plant species on which dummy caterpillars were exposed. We included live caterpillars to estimate the extent to which studies using artificial caterpillars reflect actual levels of predation. Ants and wasps were the most important damagers of dummy caterpillars, whereas bug and beetle damage was very rare, and no bird or small mammal damage was observed. Daily attack rates did not differ significantly from apparent mortality of live caterpillars (daily mortality = 12.1%), but dummy caterpillars made from dough were attacked more frequently (daily attack rate = 18.4%) than those from clay (daily attack rate = 6.9%). Caterpillars of different colour and size, and caterpillars exposed on different plant species had the same chances to be predated. This is in contrast to results from temperate area studies where birds dominate and are not affected by dummy caterpillar material, but prefer larger caterpillars. Our results are consistent with dominant predators on tropical forest caterpillars being invertebrates that are more chemically than visually oriented, so that: (1) material used for dummy caterpillars is important, (2) background matching is relatively unimportant, and (3) being large may have less of a cost. These patterns in predation might facilitate polyphagy and evolution of large body size in tropical Lepidoptera."

Cities accumulate heat in urban land covers as well as in built infrastructures, representing true islands of heat in relation to their rural (less artificialized) environment. The densest urban spaces as well as the industrial and commercial areas are characterized by accumulating more heat during the day. On the other hand, the areas of lower density, the Urban Sprawl, tend to have a better climatic behaviour. The lower density as well as the greater amount of vegetation in the Urban Sprawl areas reduce the UHI during daylight hours.Nevertheless, the literature on urban climate has highlighted the singular importance of the nighttime UHI. It is during the night that the effects of UHI become more apparent, due to the low cooling capacity of urban construction materials and is during nighttime that temperatures can cause higher health risks, leading to the aggravation of negative impacts on people's health and comfort in extreme events such as heat waves becoming more and more frequent and lasting longer. However, the study of nocturnal UHIs is still poorly developed, due to the structural problems regarding the availability of land surface and air temperature data for night time.This paper aims to develop a model for nocturnal UHI using data from Landsat thermal bands (with spatial resolution of 30 square meters per pixel) and contrasting Landsat's very limited nighttime images with daytime ones. The contrast allows the construction of cooling models of the LST based on geographical (longitude, latitude, distance to the sea, DTM, slope, orientation, etc.) and land covers characteristics (density, vegetation and building indexes, impervious surface, and others parameters). Said models will allow evaluating the nighttime LST of the different urban landscapes: historical centers, ensanches, discontinuous urban fabrics (of different densities), scattered building areas and industrial and commercial areas, trying to clarify the nightly UHI of Urban Sprawl. The case study is the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (636 km2, 3 3 million inhabitants)."

Smoke from large wildfires can travel long distances and have a harmful effect on human health, the environment, and climate in other areas. More recently, in 2018-2019 there have been many large fires. This study focused on the wildfires that occurred in the United States of America (USA), Brazil, and Australia using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) and a TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Specifically, we analyzed the spatial-temporal distribution of black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) and the vertical distribution of smoke. Based on the results, the highest detection of smoke (similar to 14 km) was observed in Brazil; meanwhile, Australia showed the largest BC column burden of similar to 1.5 mg/m(2). The meteorological conditions were similar for all sites during the fires. Moderate temperatures (between 32 and 42 degrees C) and relative humidity (30-50%) were observed, which resulted in drier conditions favorable for the burning of fires. However, the number of active fires was different for each site, with Brazil having 13 times more active fires than the USA and five times more than the number of active fires in Australia. However, the high number of active fires did not translate to higher atmospheric constituent emissions. Overall, this work provides a better understanding of wildfire behavior and the role of meteorological conditions in emissions at various sites."

Natural enemies play an important role in the regulation of many forest insect populations. The hypothesis that these organisms also reduce invasion potential is one element of a concept known as biotic resistance. While many studies have shown that the abundances of natural enemies are affected by landscape structure and diversity, seasonality, and host tree species, this study tests the hypothesis that these factors affect the biotic resistance of forest communities to invasion by a non-native tussock moth.2. At 20 sites on Vancouver Island, Canada, spanning a range of natural to urban forests, small populations of the rusty tussock moth, Orgyia antiqua, an exotic polyphagous tussock moth, were introduced. Introductions were repeated at three different periods in the year, on coniferous and deciduous host trees, and included both late-instar larvae and pupae. The survival of these small populations was monitored in relation to four landscape variables measured around each site.3. Spring introductions had significantly lower mortality rates than either early or mid-summer introductions. There was little difference in predation rates between coniferous and deciduous host trees. The amount and type of forest cover in the landscape had important, but seasonally dependent, effects on survival that likely reflect changes in the habitat requirements of a shifting community of generalist predators.4. Based on the results, this study concludes that landscapes with intermediate forest cover are the least resistant to invasion by early feeding species such as the rusty tussock moth."

The NDVI seasonal dynamics in a year with normal weather conditions includes four main phases including the 1st phase of spring NDVI increasing, the 2nd phase of the productivity maximisation of the dominant vegetation, the 3rd phase of the summer progressive decrease in photosynthetic activity in response to the heat and lack of moisture, the 4th phase of low photosynthetic activity lasting from midsummer to the late autumn. The dependence of NDVI on vegetation productivity during its maximum development in the Pre-Urals Steppe in 2016 was described by the linear regression equation. Vegetation productivity on 20 June 2010 and that on 20 June 2016, calculated by the linear regression equation, were compared. The comparison revealed that in 2010, the decline in productivity during vegetation maximum development varied between 19% and 65% depending on the type of plant community. The following plant communities were the least resilient to drought: communities of fallow lands on the locations of previous true steppes, communities which appeared under the influence of overgrazing in the locations of the previous true steppes and the communities of meadow-steppes. Good moistening resulted in a slight decline in productivity communities located in topographical depressions. Productivity of plant communities with early-spring growth of dominating species declined to a lesser degree as the communities are located on a well-warmed surface. Some biological features of the Caragana frutex + Spiraea crenata vegetation type also result in the less decline in productivity. The NDVI coefficient does not accurately reflect productivity at the end of the growing season. Therefore, patterns of declines in productivity of similar vegetation types during the drought in Trans-Urals region in 1998 were used to project the autumn decline in vegetation productivity during the drought in the Pre-Urals Steppe. Based on these findings, the average vegetation productivity in the Pre-Urals Steppe in autumn in dry 2010 were four to five times lower than that during the maximum plant development in 2016 which had favourable weather conditions. As the height of vegetation considerably reduces during drought, the availability of pasture forage may sharply drop in winter, especially if a deep snow cover accumulates and unevenly distributes according to terrain relief. In the Pre-Urals Steppe, only some steppe communities, covering about 20% of the area, are the most accessible to supply Przewalski's horses with dry pasture forage in winter. Projecting the winter supply of pasture forage after a severe drought should be based on the assumption that the forage availability may reduce by 8 to 10 times as compared with calculated summer productivity in a year with favourable weather conditions. In this regard, there is a need to make stocks of hay for feeding horses in winter after a drought. For potentially repeated droughts the sufficient amount of hay to feed Przewalski's horses in the Pre-Urals Steppe over two winter seasons should be stocked in years with normal precipitation as it will be difficult to make the stock in a dry year.For a final assessment of the accessibility of winter pasture forage stock for Przewalski's horses in the Pre-Urals Steppe, some additional field studies of productivity of the main vegetation types at the end of the growing season using the harvest method are necessary as well as an analysis of the distribution and height of snow cover on the territory in years with high winter precipitation."
