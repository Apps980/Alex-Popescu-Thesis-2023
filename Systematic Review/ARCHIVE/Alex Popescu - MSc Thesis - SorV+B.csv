"van der Marel, Annemarie; Waterman, Jane M.; Lopez-Darias, Marta",Barbary ground squirrels do not have a sentinel system but instead synchronize vigilance,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,75,,,10.1007/s00265-021-03094-1,2021,"Coordinated behaviors, such as hunting in lions and coordinated vigilance as antipredator behavior, are examples of benefits of group-living. Instead of asynchronous vigilance, some social species synchronize their vigilance bouts or take turns acting as sentinels. To increase our knowledge on the evolution of vigilance behavior, we studied whether vigilance is coordinated in Barbary ground squirrels, Atlantoxerus getulus. We show that vigilance was synchronized instead of taking turns. Multiple non-mutually exclusive hypotheses could explain synchronization: Barbary ground squirrels may perch because (1) neighbors are perched (copying effect), (2) perch synchrony may be an emergent property of the ecology as all squirrels may be satiated at the same time (collective behavior), or (3) the benefits are large in terms of evading ambush predators and scanning effectiveness (watch each other's back). Particularly, in habitats where the field of view is obstructed by man-made structures and multiple individuals may be necessary to watch for terrestrial predators, synchronized vigilance may have greater fitness benefits than sentinel behavior. We conclude that it is essential to test assumptions of coordination and, thus, to analyze coordination to describe sentinel systems. Significance statement Vigilance behavior can be vital to an animal's survival. Taking turns acting as sentinels or synchronizing vigilance bouts reduces the cost of the trade-off between feeding and predation risk. A sentinel system assumes that sentinels are vigilant from raised positions, warn group members of danger, and alternate vigilance bouts. However, the assumption of alternating vigilance bouts remains poorly tested. We tested this assumption in invasive Barbary ground squirrels. We found that instead of alternating, individuals synchronized their vigilance bouts. Perch synchrony may be (1) a response to perching group members (copying effect), (2) an emergent property of the species' ecology, and (3) an adaptation to anthropogenically altered habitats (watch each other's back)."
"Lee, Alan Tristram Kenneth",SENTINEL BEHAVIOR OR VIGILANCE AT A MACAW CLAYLICK?,ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL,28,253,260,,2017,"Sentinel behavior (co-ordinated vigilance) has been observed for a range of bird species living in family groups, usually in arid environments, but the behavior has never been formally identified for parrots. Riverside clay-licks are sites where parrots and other species congregate to consume soil, usually in large numbers. Birds feeding on the clay are vulnerable to attack from predators. The Red-and-green Macaw Ara chloropterus can be observed in the vicinity of claylicks for much of the morning, although they spend only a small amount of time feeding on the clay itself. I investigated patterns of vigilance at a riverside claylick in Peru to test whether or not the birds engage in true sentinel behavior. There was no evidence for coordination of vigilance, and overall vigilance increased with the presence of more birds on the claylick, contrary to expectation. In addition, tall perches that should serve as sentinel positions were generally occupied less when birds were feeding on the claylick, and the probability of birds on the clay increased with increasing group size. Probability of calling, which could include warning information, was not higher as a function of bird presence on the clay, but was best explained by group size. All macaws maintained a generally high state of vigilance in the vicinity of the claylick, suggesting there was no reliance on a sentinel system. Further work is needed to understand the dynamics of this behavior for this species at one of southeastern Peru's most important ecotourism resources."

In addition, individuals may engage in sentinel behaviour and other forms of vigilance, which benefits other group members not only by reducing the risk of predation, but also by allowing them to reduce their own vigilance. It remains unclear, however, whether these vigilance behaviours are selfish, and the benefits to other group members simply an unselected by-product, or whether they are forms of cooperation, and the benefits to group members a selective force favouring the behaviour. In meerkats, Suricata suricatta, both female and male helpers were more likely to perform sentinel behaviour after dependent pups had started joining the group on foraging trips. In addition, female helpers performed more bipedal vigilance and found less food when pups were in the group. These results suggest that sentinel behaviour and bipedal vigilance represent forms of cooperation in meerkats. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, the production of antipredator-related calls by young can differ from that of the same vocalizations given by adults. Sentinel behaviour is a coordinated vigilance behaviour, where one individual climbs on an elevated position and scans the surroundings for predators, while the rest of the group is mainly foraging. Meerkat, Suricata suricatta, sentinels produce six distinct sentinel call types, which inform other group members about the perceived predation risk, resulting in the adjustment of personal vigilance behaviour in foraging group members. Here, we investigated the onset of sentinel behaviour and the ontogeny of the different sentinel call types as well as the development of individual vocal signatures in meerkats. We found that meerkats started acting as a sentinel around 200 days of age, but this was highly dependent on group size, with individuals from smaller groups exhibiting sentinel behaviour earlier than individuals from larger groups. All six sentinel call types were already present in the repertoire upon first emergence of the behaviour; however, call rates of 'all-clear' calls increased while 'warning' calls decreased with increasing experience as sentinel. Analysis of one of the most frequent sentinel calls, the double note calls, indicated that fundamental frequency, mean amplitude, duration and entropy differed consistently between individuals, but we found no effect of age. Rather, our results provide evidence that individual signatures in this call type were already developed when young meerkats first started to act as sentinel and changed little with age. To conclude, we showed little ontogenetic change in overall sentinel behaviour as well as in its vocal coordination, indicating potentially high selection pressures on antipredator behaviours, such as the sentinel system, resulting in consistent behavioural responses upon first emergence.

Most of the time these sentinels announce their guarding duty with special vocalizations. The response of foraging group members to these calls was investigated by analysing observational data, and by performing playback experiments. The use of special calls by sentinels, and the responses of the foraging group members to them, suggest that the coordination of vigilance is strongly influenced by vocal communication. Sentinel calls decreased the time spent alert by the foraging group members. Other group members were less likely to go on guard when a sentinel was vocalizing Both the proportion of time during which guards overlapped, and the proportion of time the group was unprotected without a guard, decreased when sentinels announced their duty, due to better coordination of the rotation of sentinels. Suricates, however, do not appear to use sentinel calls to mediate a strict rotation of guarding duty."
"Rauber, Ramona; Clutton-Brock, Tim H.; Manser, Marta B.",Drought decreases cooperative sentinel behavior and affects vocal coordination in meerkats,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,30,1558,1566,10.1093/beheco/arz112,2019,"Cooperative breeding often evolved in harsh and arid habitats characterized by high levels of environmental uncertainty. Most forms of cooperative behavior have energetic costs and previous studies have shown that the contributions of individuals to alloparental provisioning are conditional on their food intake. However, the effect of naturally occurring, extreme environmental conditions on the persistence of costly forms of cooperative behaviors and their coordination by communication remain unknown. Here, we show that in meerkats (Suricata suricatta) the probability to act as sentinel, a cooperative vigilance behavior, was the same for typically occurring dry and wet conditions, but significantly reduced during a drought condition with almost no rain, especially in young individuals, members of small groups and groups with pups. The duration an individual stayed on sentinel guard, however, was most reduced during dry conditions. Besides reductions in sentinel behavior, the vocal coordination of foraging meerkats differed when comparing drought and wet conditions. Individuals responded more strongly to playbacks of sentinel all-clear calls and close calls, resulting in less vigilance and more foraging behavior during the drought condition. We conclude that while meerkats are adapted to commonly occurring dry periods with low rainfall, the extreme drought period with almost no rain, led to a decrease of the frequency of costly forms of cooperative behaviors in favor of behaviors that maximize direct fitness benefits and also affected the vocal coordination among group members."

Yet in the highly threatened lowland deciduous forests of South-east Asia, a mammal, the western striped squirrel Tamiops mcclellandii, which usually accompanied bird-waves, was a more obtrusive sentinel than any bird. It called most often in response to predators (40 out of 70 observations) and was the first species to emit alarm calls on 24 occasions (60%) where studied in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, western Thailand. The squirrels fed in close proximity to drongos (Dicrurus spp.), suggesting they may benefit from the drongos' tendency to mob predators. Additionally, the drongos actively followed the bark-foraging squirrels in order to capture flushed arthropods. The presence of the western striped squirrel both helped reduce the need for vigilance among avian flock members and contributed to flock cohesion."

The context-specific occurrence of acoustically distinct alarm call types may allow conclusions about their functions and/or the underlying call system. Furthermore, many group-living species exhibit a co-operative system of vigilance in terms of predator avoidance. In a descriptive field study I investigated alarm calling and sentinel activity in group-living Arabian Babblers Turdoides squamiceps focussing on the context-specificity of call type occurrence in relation to the caller's behaviour. The results revealed that two of the three different alarm call types were correlated to the distance to the predator: Barks were uttered more frequently to distant and tzwicks to close predators. Sentinels were more likely to utter barks and trills, but foraging group members tzwicks. Results suggest that sentinels detect potential dangers in greater distances and start calling earlier, whereas foraging birds detect predators only closer and therefore utter higher urgency calls. Finally, the results added to the current knowledge of the urgency-based call system of Arabian babblers, in which information can be provided on different levels: Variation in the call structure of single call types, combined use of different call types and discrete use of different call types in different contexts."
"Eastcott, Emma; Kern, Julie M.; Morris-Drake, Amy; Radford, Andrew N.",Intrapopulation variation in the behavioral responses of dwarf mongooses to anthropogenic noise,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,31,680,691,10.1093/beheco/araa011,2020,"Anthropogenic noise is an increasingly widespread pollutant, with a rapidly burgeoning literature demonstrating impacts on humans and other animals, However, most studies have simply considered if there is an effect of noise, examining the overall cohort response. Although substantial evidence exists for intraspecific variation in responses to other anthropogenic disturbances, this possibility has received relatively little experimental attention with respect to noise. Here, we used field-based playbacks with dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula) to test how traffic noise affects vigilance behavior and to examine potential variation between individuals of different age class, sex, and dominance status. Foragers exhibited a stronger immediate reaction and increased their subsequent vigilance (both that on the ground and as a sentinel) in response to traffic-noise playback compared with ambient-sound playback. Traffic-noise playback also resulted in sentinels conducting longer bouts and being more likely to change post height or location than in ambient-sound playback. Moreover, there was evidence of variation in noise responses with respect to age class and dominance status but not sex. In traffic noise, foraging pups were more likely to flee and were slower to resume foraging than adults; they also tended to increase their vigilance more than adults. Dominants were more likely than subordinates to move post during sentinel bouts conducted in traffic-noise trials. Our findings suggest that the vigilance-foraging trade-off is affected by traffic noise but that individuals differ in how they respond. Future work should, therefore, consider intra-population response variation to understand fully the population-wide effects of this global pollutant."

We examined further detailed aspects of this cooperative behaviour, including the suggestion that by engaging in this behaviour sentinels advertise their status and gain social prestige. Chosen sentinel locations were higher, but no more exposed, than the best alternative locations within 25 m. Sentinels started off closer to the centre of the foraging group than when sentinel bouts were terminated. Change-overs between sentinels were nearly always due to previous sentinels terminating their own bout. On the rare occasions when bouts were interrupted by upcoming sentinels, physical contact or aggression was extremely rare. Dominant males tended to terminate sentinel bouts of other birds, interrupting especially the dominant females. Other than this, there was no effect of an individual's sex or dominance rank on any aspect of sentinel change-overs or location choice when acting as a sentinel. There were also no differences in any sentinel activity between simple family groups, and those more complex nonfamily groups within which individuals compete for reproduction. Rates of alarm calling did not differ between group members, although dominant males did make more territorial calls to neighbouring groups while acting as a sentinel. Therefore, we found relatively little evidence that individuals compete for the chance to act as a sentinel as a means of showing off within groups of Arabian babblers. Instead, our study confirms the primary function of sentinels as a system of cooperative vigilance. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."
"Ragusa-Netto, J",Vigilance towards raptors by nuclear species in bird mixed flocks in a Brazilian savannah,STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT,37,219,226,10.1076/snfe.37.3.219.8573,2002,"A nuclear or leader species is the one around which foraging activity is organized. In the campo-cerrado (Brazilian savannah) up to four bird species (Saltator atricollis, Cypsnagra hirundinacea, Mimus saturninus, and Neothraupis fasciata) may function as nuclear or leader species in mixed species flocks. The aim of this study was to assess the features shown by these nuclear species. I quantified parameters of sociality, communication and alertness of nuclear bird species in mixed flocks with different composition. Parameters related to sociality (mean intraspecific group size) and communication (frequency of contact calls) were not correlated with the leadership. On the other hand, the most alert species was in the front of a given mixed flock most of the time. The leader species spent more time in vigilance and gave most alarm calls due to approaching raptors earlier. The results of this study strongly suggest that the alertness of a species is the major character of nuclear bird species in mixed flocks of the campo-cerrado."
"Bednekoff, Peter A.; Bowman, Reed; Woolfenden, Glen E.",Do conversational gutturals help florida scrub-jays coordinate their sentinel behavior?,ETHOLOGY,114,313,317,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2008.01467.x,2008,"Florida scrub-jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens, perform sentinel behavior in which individuals alternate bouts of watchfulness with little overlap. We examined how calls might facilitate sentinel coordination. Small soft calls labeled conversational gutturals were heard more often from sentinels than from foraging birds. Calls occurred infrequently throughout sentinel bouts but were more common later in bouts. The pattern of calling does not match predictions for a 'watchman's song' at regular intervals nor for a signal at the end of a sentinel bout. Thus, our quantitative assessment of calling by sentinels did not find support for either standard hypothesis. Although Florida scrub-jays clearly have information on each other's sentinel behavior, our results suggest that calls provide perhaps a fraction of this information."
"Sirot, Etienne",Negotiation may lead selfish individuals to cooperate: the example of the collective vigilance game.,Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences Series B,279,2862,2867,,2012,"Game-theoretical models have been highly influential in behavioural ecology. However, these models generally assume that animals choose their action before observing the behaviour of their opponents while, in many natural situations, individuals in fact continuously react to the actions of others. A negotiation process then takes place and this may fundamentally influence the individual attitudes and the tendency to cooperate. Here, I use the classical model system of vigilance behaviour to demonstrate the consequences of such behavioural negotiation among selfish individuals, by predicting patterns of vigilance in a pair of animals foraging under threat of predation. I show that the game played by the animals and the resulting vigilance strategies take radically different forms, according to the way predation risk is shared in the pair. In particular, if predators choose their target at random, the prey respond by displaying moderate vigilance and taking turns scanning. By contrast, if the individual that takes flight later in an attack endures a higher risk of being targeted, vigilance increases and there is always at least one sentinel in the pair. Finally, when lagging behind its companion in fleeing from an attacker becomes extremely risky, vigilance decreases again and the animals scan simultaneously."

N.",Ecological conditions influence sentinel decisions,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,82,1435,1441,10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.09.028,2011,"Ecological conditions can influence decisions relating to antipredator behaviour through impacts on the likelihood of detecting predators and the ability to hear vocalizations. Previous studies of antipredator behaviour have tended to focus on foragers, whose vigilance behaviour may be confounded by the type of food they are eating, and on receivers in vocal communication networks. We examined the impact of habitat and wind conditions on the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that suspend their own foraging to adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates continue feeding, and that produce a variety of calls used by foragers to adjust their antipredator behaviour. Sentinels of the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding bird, started guarding sooner and guarded for longer in long grass compared to more open habitats, and also initiated sentinel bouts sooner in high wind, probably because of the increased predation risk in such circumstances. Sentinels also selected positions that were both lower and closer to the foraging group when it was windy, potentially improving transmission of vocal signals that are valuable to foragers. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour can be influenced by extrinsic factors, as well as the intrinsic factors previously shown, and suggest that ecological variation may affect decisions bearing both selfish and cooperative benefits.

For the first time, we report postures and rates of vigilance in common wombats; our results show a limited repertoire of vigilant postures and low overall rates of vigilance. Because few studies of birds and mammals that have reported the effect of distance to conspecifics on the vigilance of focal animals have considered solitary prey species, we tested this effect in wombats. Our results show that a model including distance to cover and distance to the nearest conspecific, but not time of day, best explained the variation in the proportion of time that focal individuals spent in vigilance. Individual vigilance decreased when distance to cover increased. Vigilance of wombats increased when there was a conspecific within a radius of 70 m of the focal individual. In addition, we tested whether pairs of nearby wombats scanned independently of one another, coordinated their activity in non-overlapping bouts of vigilance or synchronised their bouts of vigilance. Wombats in close proximity exhibited independent bouts of individual vigilant and foraging activity. Thus, in this solitary species, our results support the assumption that individuals scan independently of each other."
"Bednekoff, PA; Woolfenden, GE",Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) are sentinels more when well-fed (even with no kin nearby),ETHOLOGY,109,895,903,10.1046/j.0179-1613.2003.00926.x,2003,"Sentinels occupy high, exposed positions while other group members forage nearby. If sentinel behavior involves a foraging-predation risk trade-off, animals should be sentinels more when fed supplemental food. When individual Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) were fed fragments of peanuts, during the following 30 min they shifted 30% of their time from foraging to sentinel behavior. In a follow-up experiment, we fed either one or two members in each group. As before, the jays reduced their foraging and spent much more time as sentinels when given supplemental food. In each treatment, pairs were sentinels simultaneously considerably less often than expected by chance. The dramatic shift from foraging to sentinel behavior suggests that for Florida scrub-jays sentinel behavior brings substantial benefits for no greater cost than that of lost opportunities to forage. Because the results held for simple mated pairs of scrub-jays, we argue that kin selection and social prestige are not necessary to explain sentinel behavior."

J.",Facultative response to a kleptoparasite by the cooperatively breeding pied babbler,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,18,324,330,10.1093/beheco/arl092,2007,"In many cases of interspecific kleptoparasitism, hosts develop defensive behaviors to minimize the impact of kleptoparasites. Because vigilance and defensive behaviors are often costly, selection should favor hosts that adjust the amount of investment needed to minimize losses to kleptoparasitism. However, examples of such facultative responses are rare. Here, we investigate the response of cooperatively breeding pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) to the drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis), an avian kleptoparasite that regularly follows pied babbler groups, often giving alarm calls to alert the group to predators but also occasionally giving false alarm calls in order to steal food items. We show that pied babbler response to drongos varies markedly according to babbler group size. In small groups, where there are few individuals available to act as sentinels, babblers sentinel less when a drongo is present and respond strongly to drongo alarm calls. However, in large groups, where there are many individuals available to participate in predator vigilance, babblers sentinel more often when a drongo is present, rarely respond to drongo alarm calls, and aggressively displace drongos, with a consequent decline in the number of successful kleptoparasitism events. This behavior represent a facultative response to a kleptoparasite according to the costs versus benefits of tolerating their presence."

Both flights and alarms elicited high levels of antipredator behaviour. Freezing and vigilance occurred significantly more in parent-than in intensively-reared coveys. Upright vigilant posture was performed significantly more by males than by females. Good sentinels, i.e. the more vigilant males, formed a stable pair bond earlier than the other males. Advanced reproductive timing might compensate for the increased risk of predation from a sustained vigilance."

Sentinel behaviour involves a unique cooperative system of dedicated look-outs which protect members of their social group from attack by predators. Using detailed observations from groups of Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps, we tested the original theoretical suggestion that cooperative sentinel systems are simply the result of individually selfish state-dependent patterns of behaviour.2. Sentinel effort and the number of sentinel bouts per individual per hour were greater for males than females, and both increased with individual dominance status within the group.3. Sentinel behaviour was unaffected by group social structure, in terms of patterns of relatedness and the number of potential breeders.4. Total group sentinel effort increased with group size, while the effort per individual decreased irrespective of sex and dominance rank. Simultaneous sentinel behaviour by two or more birds was very rare, but increased with group size.5. Sentinel effort followed seasonal fluctuations in food availability, but not peaks of raptor migration through the study site.6. Body mass was greater for males than females and was positively related to dominance rank. Overall, body mass explained much of the variation in individual sentinel effort both within and between birds. However, data on individual foraging performance could not be related to changes in body mass and thus to differences in sentinel effort.7. Sentinel behaviour in groups of Arabian babblers therefore confirms many of the predictions arising from state-dependent models of cooperative, yet individually selfish, sentinel behaviour."

Recent research has suggested that some species are information givers', particularly social species with cooperative vigilance systems, and that these species may consequently affect community structure by influencing the behaviour and niche utilization of other species. Here, using behavioural observations and playback experiments, we compared the behavioural change in a solitary species (the scimitarbill) and a social species (the pied babbler), to the presence and alarm calls of one another. Our results revealed that scimitarbills underwent significant behavioural changes in the presence of social pied babblers: they reduced their vigilance rate by over 60%, increased their foraging efficiency and expanded their niche by moving into open habitat and excavating subterranean food items. In contrast, pied babblers - who have an effective intraspecific sentinel system - did not show significant behavioural changes to the presence or alarm calls of scimitarbills. These results suggest that interspecific interceptive eavesdropping can provide significant benefits, influencing the behaviour and habitat utilization of eavesdropping species."

Ian",Vigilance behavior in the Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus histrionicus) during the preincubation period in labrador: Are males vigilant for self or social partner?,AUK,124,241,252,10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[241:VBITHD]2.0.CO;2,2007,"Males of several avian species are more vigilant than their female partners, particularly during the preincubation period. Male vigilance may function as a deterrent of extrapair copulation attempts (EPCs) or to ensure male survival, because males of sexually dimorphic species may be more conspicuous to predators than females. However, vigilant males may act as antipredator sentinels to enhance female survivorship, which may also allow females to feed and rest more efficiently, thereby enhancing their ability to form clutches. We attempted to distinguish between the male benefits and female benefits hypotheses by studying the behavior of unpaired males and paired Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) during the preincubation period. Paired males were, on average, four times more vigilant than unpaired males and their mates, which suggests that elevated levels of vigilance by paired males does not function primarily for self-protection against predators. Males were not more vigilant during the female's fertile period, contrary to the paternity assurance hypothesis. Male vigilance during feeding bouts was highest when pairs fed alone near shore-a condition in which feeding was likely more risky. Male vigilance was positively correlated with female feeding when females fed near shore, but not at other times. During resting bouts, males were vigilant 14 +/- 0.01% of the time in all conditions. We suggest that male vigilance may be important to enhance female survival, especially when females feed under risky conditions."

Variation in use of the watchman's song by sentinel dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,85,967,975,10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.02.020,2013,"Social information is invaluable in assessing the need for antipredator behaviour. Individuals can acquire such information by observing the behaviour of others, but reliance on visual cues may be undermined by visual obstructions and social monitoring is often incompatible with foraging. Vocal communication does not require the close proximity of senders and receivers or the suspension of other activities, and there is increasing evidence that foragers can use vocalizations to inform decisions about their own vigilance. However, less work has focused on what factors influence signallers in this context. We used detailed behavioural observations and a playback experiment manipulating perceived risk to investigate the calling behaviour of dwarf mongoose sentinels. Sentinels vocalized more often in dense habitats and when foragers were further away, when visual cues were less likely to be useful. Sentinels also vocalized more in situations most advantageous to others, including when groupmates were likely to be distracted (e.g. when babysitting or foraging) and following an alarm call; sentinels may provide an 'all clear' signal. Call rate was reduced in high-risk situations, such as immediately after an alarm call. Individuals of different age, sex and dominance status varied in their likelihood of calling and their response to situations of similar risk, probably because of different cost-benefit trade-offs for separate classes. Our study offers strong evidence that dwarf mongoose sentinels are adjusting their vocal behaviour both to enhance the likelihood that groupmates are aware of their presence and to provide potentially valuable social information about current risk.

An individual of a prey species is assumed to benefit from an increase in the number of group members by reducing its own investment in vigilance. However, the proximate mechanism generating the decrease in vigilance with increasing group size is unclear. Most models of this relation assume that either individuals coordinate their scans in nonoverlapping bouts of vigilance or animals scan independently of one another. We studied the relation between vigilance and group size in the eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus, analysing vigilance at two structural levels, individual vigilance and collective vigilance of the group. We tested both assumptions, coordination and independence of scanning. The time that an individual spent vigilant decreased with group size. However, the time during which at least one individual in the group scanned the environment (collective vigilance) increased up to a group size of seven individuals but decreased thereafter. Analyses revealed that individuals neither coordinated their scanning in an asynchronous way nor scanned independently of one another. On the contrary, both the onset and the end of individuals' scanning bouts were synchronized between group members, producing waves of collective vigilance. Bouts of vigilance and nonvigilance activity tended to be synchronized. Our results appear to support a hypothesis of allelomimetic vigilance.

Most studies of the effects of neighbors on vigilance have focused on individual vigilance. We investigated the effects of neighbors on vigilance in wild red-necked pademelons Thylogale thetis foraging at night in nonpersistent aggregations in a clearing in rain forest. Neither the total number of pademelons in the clearing nor the numbers at various distances around focal individuals affected the individual vigilance of focal animals. However, focal animals' individual vigilance did change with the distance to their nearest neighbor and also with distance to cover. Pairs of individuals closer than 10 m apart tended to synchronize their bouts of individual vigilance and foraging. The degree of synchrony within pairs increased with both distance to cover and the total number of pademelons foraging in the area and decreased with increasing distance to the pair's nearest neighbor but did not vary with the distance separating the members of the pair. Thus, despite their individual vigilance being unaffected by the number of other pademelons in the feeding aggregation, pademelons were nonetheless sensitive to the presence of conspecifics and adjusted their behavior in relation to their separation from neighbors. Thus, some vigilance benefits may be obtained from the presence of conspecifics even in species that aggregate only temporarily on food patches without forming more permanent social groups."

Studies of vigilance are generally concerned with exploring the relationship between vigilance rates and group size. However, a mechanistic understanding of the rules individual animals use to achieve this group-level behavior is lacking. Building on a previous modeling approach, we suggest that individuals reconcile their own private information against the social information they receive from their group mates in order to decide whether to feed or be vigilant at any one time. We present a novel modeling approach utilizing a Markov chain Monte Carlo process to describe the transition between vigilant and nonvigilant states. Many of our assumptions are based qualitatively on recently published experimental observations. We vary the amount of social information and the fidelity with which individuals process this information and show that this has a profound effect on the individual vigilance rate, the individual vigilant bout length, and the proportion of vigilant individuals at any one time. A wide range of group-level vigilance patterns can be obtained by varying simple behavioral characteristics of individual animals. We find that generally, increasing the amount of, and sensitivity to, social information generates a more cooperative vigilance behavior. This model potentially provides a theoretical and conceptual framework for examining specific real-life systems. We propose analyzing individual-based data from real animals by considering their group to be a connected network of individuals, with information transfer between them."

An experimental investigation,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,85,137,142,10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.017,2013,"Sentinel behaviour, where individuals take turns to watch for danger and give alarm calls to approaching predators, has been observed in a number of animal societies. However, the evolutionary causes of this behaviour remain unclear. There are two main, competing hypotheses regarding the evolution of sentinel behaviour. The first hypothesis is that it is a cooperative behaviour, where group members benefit from the detection of danger but share the workload of acting as a sentinel. The second is that it is a safe, selfish behaviour. Under the second hypothesis, once an individual is satiated, being a sentinel is safer because sentinels can detect threats more readily and can therefore escape from predators faster. We examined whether sentinels are safer than foragers in a wild, free-living cooperative bird (the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor) with a well-described sentinel system. We found that sentinel behaviour was costly because (1) sentinels were targeted by predators more often, (2) they were further from cover than foragers, and (3) they took longer to reach the safety of cover following a predator alarm. These results suggest that individuals do not become sentinels because it is safer. This is the first study to demonstrate that sentinels are at greater risk of predator attack than foraging group members and suggests sentinel activity may have evolved as a form of cooperative behaviour.

To this aim, we first tested the null hypothesis of no association between foraging individuals of the diurnal rodent, Octodon degus and their pairwise relatedness (six microsatellite loci), under natural conditions. Secondly, we examined the influence of relatedness on scan effort (percent overlapping) and temporal distribution of scanning using linear regression. Finally, we evaluated whether temporal distributions of scanning were significantly lower (coordination) or higher (synchrony) than random expectations using bootstrapping. We found that pairwise relatedness between focal degus and their foraging partner did not influence the scan effort or the temporal distribution of scanning. These original, field-based findings imply that vigilance behavior in socially foraging degus is unlikely to be kin-selected and adds to results from previous lab studies in that kinship remains a poor predictor of social behavior in these animals. Overall, our study adds to others revealing that kin selection may not have had an impact on aspects of social behavior such as vigilance during social foraging."

However, an effect of sex on collective vigilance is less often studied (and therefore rarely predicted), despite being relevant to any consideration of the adaptiveness of mixed vs single-sex grouping. Controlling for group size, we studied the effect of sex on vigilance in the sexually dimorphic eastern grey kangaroo Macropus giganteus, analysing vigilance at two structural levels: individual vigilance and the group's collective vigilance. Knowing that group members in this species tend to synchronise their bouts of vigilance, we tested (for the first time) whether sex affects the degree of synchrony between group members. We found that females were individually more vigilant than males and that their vigilance rate was unaffected by the presence of males. Collective vigilance did not differ between female-only and mixed-sex groups of the same size. Vigilance in mixed-sex groups was neither more nor less synchronous than in single-sex groups of females, and the presence of males seemed not to affect the degree of synchrony between females. Sixty-six percent of vigilant acts were unique (performed when no other kangaroo was alert), and only about one unique vigilant act in every three induced a collective wave of vigilance. The proportions of vigilant acts that were unique were 60% for females but only 46% for males. However, the sexes differed little in the rates at which their unique vigilant acts were copied. This limited study shows that the differences in vigilance between male and female kangaroos had no discernible effect upon collective vigilance."

We also evaluated the influence of group size on these behaviors. During 60 h of observations on each species, the association was studied in a periurban area in Brazil with scan samplings. The presence of F. rufus increased the frequency of foraging while reducing the time that M. saturninus dedicated to alert/sentinel behaviors.

While it is well established that there is variation due to differences in the costs and benefits for individuals of different sex, age and dominance status, shorter-term social, internal and environmental factors are also likely to be important. Sentinel behaviour, where individuals adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates forage, offers an opportunity to test hypotheses about context-dependent differences in contributions to group behaviour. Here we used field experiments to manipulate the conspecific audience, satiation state and perceived danger level of dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, to investigate how sentinel contributions are modulated by individual context. In addition to standard measures of sentinel behaviour (likelihood of becoming a sentinel, number of bouts, bout duration), we considered within-bout behaviour in terms of surveillance calls and attentiveness (head-scanning rate and distraction levels). We found that the presence of a neighbouring forager (audience) decreased sentinel contributions, while individuals increased their sentinel investment when satiated and experiencing an increased danger level. Changes in head-scanning rate provided evidence for an interaction between the effect of satiation and danger levels, demonstrating that sentinel attentiveness was influenced by changes in context. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour is strongly context dependent, with effects seen in initial bout and bout quantity decisions, as well as within-bout characteristics, and that individual contributions to group behaviours can vary depending on social, internal and environmental factors.

Predation risk is affected by a range of ecological, social and individual variables, which can fluctuate over different timescales. In general, current risk levels are known to influence the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates are engaged in other activities. However, there has been little consideration of whether decisions made at different stages of a sentinel bout are affected in the same way by perceived predation risk and whether the same level of behavioural plasticity is exhibited when making these different decisions. Here we used detailed behavioural observations and a playback experiment to investigate the behavioural choices of dwarf mongoose sentinels at three different stages of a bout (before, start, during). Individuals were more likely to begin a bout, and did so sooner, following alarm calls, which are immediate, direct indicators of elevated risk. Sentinels selected an initial height from which to guard depending on factors that tended to vary in the medium term (hours), choosing higher positions in denser habitat and less windy conditions. In contrast, decisions about bout duration were made in relation to short-term (seconds/minutes) changes in information, with sentinels guarding for longer when an alarm call was given during a bout, and terminating bouts sooner when groupmates moved out of sight. Our results demonstrate that sentinel decisions are influenced by both direct and indirect indicators of likely predation risk and that sentinel behaviour is adjusted flexibly with regard to information presented on various timescales, highlighting the complexity of decision-making processes.

Specifically, we made four predictions: 1. Helpers participate to a non-trivial degree in sentinel behaviour; 2. Breeding pairs with helpers spend less time on sentinel behaviour and hence more time foraging; 3. Breeders with helpers have more protected foraging time; and 4. Groups with helpers have greater total sentinel time.Results of the two studies agreed on most major points and even, in many cases, on minor points and quantitative aspects. Non-breeding adult helper birds participated in sentinel watches almost as much as breeders in their group. In winter, breeding pairs with one or more helpers decreased their own sentinel time compared with that of unassisted pairs. However, in the one study, the concomitantly increased available foraging time of breeders was no better protected by another group member being on sentinel than in the lone pairs. Results of the other study showed a significant increase of protected foraging time for breeding males only. In winter, groups with helpers did not have increased total sentinel time; time was either the same (Study A) or significantly less (Study B). During nesting, breeders with helpers did not, decrease their sentinel effort relative to lone pairs. Instead, groups with helpers had a sentinel for more time. These results are interpreted as indicating that, in winter, sentinel behaviour is more important to antiraptor defense in lone pairs than larger groups. In groups with helpers the mere addition of extra pairs of eyes and ears may render formal sentinel behaviour less necessary, so breeders can decrease their sentinel time and increase their foraging time. During nesting, additional sentinels may be important for increased nest protection. The presence of helpers contributing to predator detection may thus be an important factor in the better annual survival and nesting success of breeders that have helpers (WOOLFENDEN & FITZPATRICK 1984)."

Both hypotheses predict decreasing individual vigilance levels with increasing group size; however, the collective detection hypothesis also predicts increasing overall group vigilance with increasing group size. However, in species in which vigilance and foraging are not mutually exclusive, where vigilance may not be as costly, neither of these hypotheses may apply. Here, we examine the relationship between group size and vigilance in the social Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), a species that can combine foraging and vigilance behaviours. Ten groups were observed using scan sampling, measuring both group and individual vigilance and group size. A negative relationship existed between individual vigilance and group size and a positive relationship between group vigilance and group size. Therefore, in Cape ground squirrels, vigilance seems to be costly even though it can be combined with foraging behaviours. Furthermore, group vigilance behaviour gives support to the collective detection hypothesis, whilst individual vigilance gives support to both hypotheses."

Thus individual variation in vigilance may result in significant fitness consequences. We used mixed-effects models to document individual variation in vigilance in wild adult female eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) in Queensland, Australia. We tested the effects of group size, presence of adult males and wind on vigilance patterns and variation by analysing 399 five-minute samples on 31 individually identified females who were foraging on the periphery of groups. We determined the proportion of time that individuals spent vigilant, and the proportions of vigilance time spent in social versus antipredator vigilance and in low- versus high-intensity vigilance postures. The proportion of time females spent vigilant decreased with increasing group size but was not affected by wind speed or male presence, while the amount of their vigilance time spent in social vigilance was affected by interactions among the variables. After controlling for these effects, 13 females' vigilance patterns were significantly different from the population mean. Individual variation was also found in vigilance postures used and the effect of male presence. Understanding individual variation in vigilance is important for understanding individuals' antipredator and social strategies."

However, the lack of control over predator behavior hampers our understanding of the effect of predator attack patterns on vigilance. To circumvent this limitation, I developed a virtual experiment in which the behavior of the (virtual) predator was under full control of the experimenter. In the virtual experiment, I altered the frequency and unpredictability of attacks to document how human subjects (N = 45), which acted as surrogate prey, altered their vigilance in response to changes in predator attack patterns. Subjects increased the frequency of their vigilance bouts when the virtual predator attacked more frequently and increased vigilance bout duration when the predator attacked more unpredictably, thus showing an increase in vigilance when predation risk increased. Other features of vigilance in the virtual environment also fitted predictions from current theories of vigilance. In particular, subjects overemphasized safety in the early stages of the experiment when learning about predator attack patterns. Strong individual differences in both the frequency and duration of vigilance bouts also emerged in the virtual environment. Such individual differences feature prominently in the vigilance literature in birds and mammals. The virtual environment thus provides a unique tool to assess vigilance patterns in a controlled environment."

In the former, the onus has been on ecological and demographic factors that select for offspring philopatry; in the latter, the importance of factors such as foraging success and predation risk are more typically emphasized. We examined the association between predation risk and both group size and foraging behaviour in the chestnut-crowned babbler, Pomatostomus ruficeps, a family-living cooperatively breeding bird that does not appear to face classic ecological or demographic constraints on dispersal and breeding. Groups were more likely to encounter, and be attacked by, avian predators when dependent young were present. Large groups were also more likely to encounter a predator, but less likely to be attacked by it, consistent with a benefit of group living through early predator detection or confusion effects. In addition, the average risk of predation for a given individual was reduced in large groups compared to small ones, owing to the dilution effect. That predation might partly select for group living in this species is boosted by findings showing reductions in ground foraging and increases in sentinel behaviour when predation risk was higher. We conclude that predation might represent an important force selecting for sociality in chestnut-crowned babblers, and highlight the need for future studies to consider more explicitly inherent benefits to group living in the evolution of vertebrate cooperative breeding systems. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Routine vigilance is an important component of foraging for many species and can occupy a large proportion of this time. Vigilance can conflict with some aspects of foraging (i.e. searching) and, consequently, has the potential to reduce feeding rates by interrupting foraging behaviours. However, for animals that handle food in an upright posture vigilance can be compatible with this portion of handling and, therefore, any vigilance during this time will incur minimal time-costs to foraging.2. Several functional response models that incorporate vigilance have assumed that, (i) vigilance preferentially occurs during compatible portions of a foraging routine where no costs are incurred; and (ii) vigilance can be treated as a single discrete block of time related in frequency to the feeding rate, i.e. one vigilance scan per feeding event.3. To determine whether these assumption are appropriate we measured the vigilance behaviour of four species of granivorous bird, yellowhammer, tree sparrow, linnet and grey partridge, and assessed the quantity of vigilance compared to compatible handling time, the relationship between scan rate and feeding rate and the distribution of vigilance during compatible and non-compatible portions of foraging.4. The results show that there was frequently enough compatible handling time to accommodate routine vigilance, yet a high proportion of vigilance occurred during non-compatible components of foraging, thus incurring a time-cost. The frequency of vigilance bouts was higher than the feeding rate for three species and, therefore, routine vigilance was not just a by-product of the feeding rate (i.e. one scan per peck). Frequent head-down searching behaviour was recorded during handling suggesting that searching is still a prominent component of foraging even when prey is superabundant.5. We have shown that the assumptions of previous functional response models might underestimate the effects of vigilance on feeding rate by overestimating the proportion of compatible handling devoted to vigilance. Future functional response models must account for this distribution of vigilance between compatible and non-compatible behavioural states. We derive an example of such a model; however, more experimental research will be needed before we understand the factors that influence the distribution of vigilance."

Given this context, we studied the vigilance behaviors in two wild cloven-hoofed animals, the Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) and the Tibetan gazelle (Procapra picticaudata) on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, to explore if the two randomness principles work across species. The results showed that the distribution of inter-scan intervals of both Tibetan antelope and Tibetan gazelle followed the negative exponential distribution; inter-scans of both Tibetan antelope and Tibetan gazelle were unrelated with their previous scan, and most sequences of inter-scan intervals could be considered as random organized or unpredictable. In conclusion, the vigilance patterns of Tibetan antelope and Tibetan gazelle followed instantaneous randomness and sequential randomness of Pulliam model. A random vigilance strategy might be the best choice for Tibetan ungulates, and how to distinguish the social vigilance from anti-predator vigilance is an important issue for future research."

Vigilance behavior is monitoring specifically to detect external threats. Previous studies of vigilance behavior were focused mainly on the influence of predation threats, whereas the influences of conspecific factors, such as intragroup threats, have been relatively unstudied. Individual vigilance is predicted to be inversely related to the group size or the number of individuals nearby if the main target of the vigilance is a predation threat and positively related if the main target of the vigilance is a conspecific threat. I studied wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania, and measured the vigilance duration when they are resting on the ground via 2-min focal observation. In both males and females, vigilance duration increased as the number of individuals nearby increased. This result agrees with the idea that the chimpanzees are vigilant toward other group members. In addition, maternal vigilance monitors and protects the safety of dependent offspring as the duration of maternal vigilance was longer when a dependent infant was separated from its mother than when the offspring was in contact with its mother. The results indicate that the vigilance behavior in wild chimpanzees was affected by conspecific factors."

We examined the role of flock size and anthropogenic disturbances in the human-dominated landscape on collective vigilance and level of synchronization. The proportion of time during which at least one individual scanned the surroundings (collective vigilance) increased with flock size and was higher in the more disturbed buffer zone of the lake. Synchronization of vigilance occurred more frequently in the smaller flocks but was not related to the risk of disturbance. Synchronization implies that individuals tend to monitor and copy the vigilance of neighbors.

Armadillos with higher vigilance levels had longer flight distances, suggesting that vigilance may also have antipredator benefits. Further examination of flight distances revealed that they varied with age, weather conditions, and time of year (breeding versus non-breeding season), and were negatively correlated with body size. In total, the results indicate the complexity of vigilance in a solitary species and suggest that armadillo vigilance is multifunctional."

As in previous studies, inter-individual proximity explained variation in individual vigilance rates. Focal animals with associates within 2 m and with multiple associates in the same tree were less vigilant than isolated animals. Activity and class of focal animals as well as the presence of neonates influenced the average vigilance of adult and subadult black howler monkeys. We conclude that functional explanations must be considered for the general lack of a group size effect on primate vigilance."

However, previous studies have shown that herbivores are able to reduce the foraging cost of vigilance by chewing their food during vigilance bouts ('vigilance with chewing', as compared to 'vigilance without chewing'). How predation risk, food availability and competition affect both the functions and the foraging costs of vigilance remains an open question. We studied female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, during winter and summer, when available food supplies were poor and rich, respectively, to investigate how group size, distance to cover, proximity between foragers and food patch quality affected decisions of foraging female kangaroos to exhibit antipredator or social vigilance, distinguishing vigilance with and without chewing. The use of antipredator vigilance was mainly driven by the perception of predation risk, and antipredator vigilance without chewing decreased with increased group size whereas antipredator vigilance with chewing increased nonlinearly with group size in winter. Distance to cover affected both forms of antipredator vigilance in summer only but there was no effect of nearest-neighbour distance. Social vigilance was affected positively by group size, and distance between foragers affected social vigilance without chewing positively, particularly in winter, and social vigilance with chewing negatively. Finally, patch quality increased the use of social vigilance with chewing in both seasons and decreased the use of antipredator vigilance with chewing in winter. This study provides new information on how animals make decisions about the functions and foraging costs of vigilance and allows a better understanding of how social foragers respond to an ever-changing environment.

Here, we investigate the vigilance architecture of a colony of wild-living grey-headed flying-foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) in Australia and examine how spatial as well as temporal variation in social organization influences social and environmental vigilance. We sampled color-marked individuals at different stages of the reproductive cycle and the year and at different locations in the colony to examine the effects of temporal and spatial factors on social and environmental vigilance. We found that vigilance architecture reflected the social structure of the colony, with the highest environmental vigilance being displayed by bats at the periphery of the colony, and the highest social vigilance by bats that roosted at intermediate distances from the colony's edge. Furthermore, we found that vigilance levels reflected changes in reproductive state, with social vigilance increasing toward the mating season, particularly in males. Our findings show that spatial and temporal variation in social structure can have differential effects on social and environmental vigilance. This highlights the necessity to differentiate between functions of vigilance to understand fully vigilance architecture in aggregations of social animals."

We investigated variability in the relationship between group size and vigilance in the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) by testing whether all individuals showed decreased vigilance with increased group size, as has been commonly assumed. We carried out both behavioural observations of entire groups of kangaroos and focal observations of individually recognised wild female kangaroos. As in other studies, we found a collective group-size effect on vigilance; however, individuals varied in their vigilance patterns. The majority (57%) of the identified individual kangaroos did not show significant group-size effects for any of the recorded measures of vigilance. The females that did not show a negative group-size effect were, on average, more vigilant than those females that did show a group-size effect, but this difference was not significant. We propose that some females exhibit higher levels of social vigilance than others, and that this social vigilance increases with group size, cancelling out any group-size effect on anti-predator vigilance for those females. Our results therefore suggest that only some prey individuals may gain anti-predator benefits by reducing their time spent scanning when in larger groups. The large amount of variation that we found in the vigilance behaviour of individual kangaroos highlights the importance of collecting and analysing vigilance data at the individual level, which requires individual recognition."

Low-cost vigilance, by comparison, allows animals to be vigilant while engaged in other activities, thereby reducing the cost of vigilance. Here, we investigate the use of high-and low-cost vigilance in relation to environmental and temporal factors in a wild population of the bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis), a small mesopredator, using behavioral observations of eight habituated animals. We hypothesized that vigilance would increase with tall, dense vegetation, high wind speeds, and low ambient light, and that vigilance would decrease in the presence of conspecifics and over the period of a single observation session. Overall, bat-eared foxes spent significantly more time engaged in low-cost vigilance than in high-cost vigilance. High-cost vigilance increased with vegetation height, in the presence of adult conspecifics and in winter. We suggest these effects are due to impeded lines of sight with increases in vegetation height, increased competition in the presence of conspecifics, and increased social interactions in winter. Low-cost vigilance was highest at the start of observational sessions, and we suggest that this is due to observer effects, as foxes demonstrated increases in both high-and low-cost vigilance specifically towards observers during this time. This study demonstrates that foxes are highly dynamic in their vigilance behavior. Due to the low predation pressure in the study area, the use of mostly low-cost vigilance may be sufficient in this environment, and thus foxes can allocate more time to other activities. Our results indicate that, in this environment, vigilance is most likely driven by factors other than predation risk, but that foxes may still respond to certain cues of predation risk. Ultimately, in areas of low predation risk, species susceptible to predation may retain responses to cues of risk, but adapt behaviors to reduce the associated costs.Significance statementWhile studies examining perceived risk in herbivores frequently assess vigilance, the examination of vigilance is largely under-investigated in mesopredators. Here, we present findings from one of the first studies to examine high-and low-cost vigilance in a small mesopredator. We demonstrate that in an area with minimal predation pressure low-cost vigilance is more intensively used and that despite the absence of predator sightings, ambush predators may still pose a perceived threat to foxes. Ultimately, when predation pressure is low, social interactions and competition may be some of the costliest activities. Results further indicate that while this small canid habituates quickly to observer presence, the initial presence of observers cannot be considered truly neutral."

Social vigilance might be expected to play an important role in foraging groups with frequent conflicts over resources. I examined social vigilance in skimming semi-palmated sandpipers, Calidris pusilla, which exploit minute prey at the surface of the substrate using a head-down position that leaves them vulnerable to aggressive displacement by neighbours. Attacks over resources occurred frequently in skimming sandpipers. In these groups, vigilance increased when neighbours were closer, suggesting that close neighbours posed a threat and that vigilance has a non-negligible social component in skimming groups. The negative exponential distribution best fitted the empirical distribution of intervals between successive vigilance bouts during skimming. This type of distribution implies that a bout of vigilance is initiated at the same rate regardless of the time spent head down in the current skimming bout, a feature that would prevent would-be attackers from targeting sandpipers at times of predictable vulnerability. This study shows that the occurrence of threats from within the group can promote randomness in the temporal organization of vigilance. (c) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

How extrinsic (e.g., predator activity within certain habitats) and intrinsic (e.g., within-group competition) cues interact depends on the biology of the prey species. However, very little is known about the impact of the actual presence of the predator in the vicinity on fine scale prey vigilance behavior. For this study, we monitored the vigilance of plains zebra (Equus quagga) and impala (Aepyceros melampus) in and around Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. We assessed how the presence of radio-collared lions (Panthera leo) affected the vigilance of their prey. To evaluate the factors affecting vigilance behavior, we measured routine and intense vigilance. Routine vigilance can be conducted while chewing, although during intense vigilance chewing is halted and thus imposes foraging costs as food processing is delayed. As the most acute form of vigilance, we predicted that the presence of lions would lead to an increase in intense vigilance in both species. We found this to be the case for zebra, a key prey species for lions, while impala adjusted their intense vigilance to risk cues less specific to the presence of lions. Potential predation risk posed by lions in the immediate vicinity differs not only between species but also for a given species in different contexts. Our results also reveal how other environmental risk indicators influence the structure of vigilance behavior of large prey species in a manner that reflects their respective ecologies."

Significant differences were observed between feeding behaviour of single individual and individuals in larger flocks. Also, the time spent in vigilance was inversely correlated to flock size. The observed negative correlation between peck rate and duration of vigilance also suggested that individuals do benefit in their foraging ability when they are in groups of larger sizes because they can spend less time in vigilance.

Both sexes spent more time in vigilance and less time in feeding during the breeding season. Sexual and seasonal differences in vigilance were the result of different mechanisms. Males had shorter feeding bouts than females but there mere no sexual differences in the length of the vigilance bouts. On the contrary, seasonal differences were the result of males and females having longer vigilance bouts during the breeding season but there were no seasonal differences in the length of the feeding bouts. During the non-breeding season, individual vigilance was higher in rheas foraging alone than in groups. In this case, solitary birds had longer vigilance and shorter feeding bouts than birds foraging, in groups.

The effects of group size on vigilance level were examined after controlling for several potentially confounding variables. In a pair-wise analysis, investment in vigilance decreased with increasing group size. Distance to cover had a non-linear effect on vigilance; scan length was at its shortest at an intermediate distance and longest at the longest distance to obstructive cover. The association between group size and vigilance remained after controlling for the effect of distance to cover. Investment in vigilance also decreased with the proximity to neighbours. Group size per se did not affect the level of vigilance after controlling for the effect of neighbour distance, whereas neighbour distance had an effect of its own after controlling for group size and distance to cover."

Because synchronized vigilance deviates from the classical vigilance models, which assume independent scanning, it is important to understand when and why it occurs. We explored vigilance behavior of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in a population subject to spatial variation in human hunting risk and seasonal variation in food availability. Group members synchronized their vigilance behavior. We hypothesized that vigilance synchronization would be context dependent and the trade-off between energy gain and safety would shape the relationship between the degree of vigilance synchronization and group size. We predicted weaker synchronization in large groups under heavy predation risk, due to benefits of numerical dilution, and stronger synchronization in large groups when food is limiting, due to intense food competition. The degree of synchronization decreased with increasing group size in the area where human hunting added another risk factor to the natural predation, pointing at the safety benefits of vigilance synchrony for members of small groups and the role of human-induced risk in shaping vigilance synchrony. We found no relation between vigilance synchrony and group size in a food scarce, winter season. However, low levels of vigilance and its synchronization observed in winter indicated that energy gain was prioritized over safety. Thus, members of wild boar groups can adjust levels of vigilance and its synchronization depending on the forage-risk trade-off set by the ecological context."

Evidence indicates that both social conditions and predator risk affect how individuals perceive environmental threat, however, the relative influence of each type of risk remains unclear. The risk allocation hypothesis considers how individuals respond to predation risk over time by adapting their investment in high-quality or low-quality vigilance. Here we use the risk allocation hypothesis as a guide to examine how different risk factors influence vigilance quantity and quality in Cape ground squirrels, Xerus inauris. We tested how the social conditions of age, sex, distance to a safe refuge, distance from a nearest neighbour and predator risk affect the amount of time ( quantity) individuals spend vigilant. Individuals were more vigilant in areas with more potential predators and when they were further from a safe refuge or nearest neighbour. We then tested whether these risk factors that affected vigilance quantity also affected vigilance quality by measuring exclusive vigilance (high-cost, high-quality) and shared-foraging-vigilance (low-cost, low-quality). Individuals in high-predation risk areas invested more time in high-cost vigilance behaviour than in low-cost vigilance/foraging behaviour compared with individuals in low-predation risk areas. Since squirrels invested in high-cost vigilance significantly more than in low-cost vigilance regardless of distance to a refuge or other squirrels, we suggest that combined foraging with vigilance compromises vigilance to lower its quality.

Results show that individual vigilance decreased with increasing group size, especially between solitary individuals and groups of 2. Moreover, the collective vigilance was, whatever the group size, below the individual vigilance in solitary animals. The study of the motor variability of vigilance behaviour allows three types of movement to be distinguished. The mean durations of each type vary largely, but are almost constant whatever the group size. On the other hand, the relative proportions of the vigilance acts change according to group size. Although previous studies of vigilance are in keeping with the functional approach of behaviour, these data are interpreted in terms of proximate causation. A mechanism based on allelomimesis is proposed to explain the results."

However, group size often explains a small amount of variation in vigilance, suggesting that other factors such as individual differences might contribute. For instance, individuals could maintain different vigilance levels overall and also respond differently to variation in group size. We investigated individual variation in vigilance and its patterns of plasticity in flocks of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758)). We carried out observations at one provisioned site and used multiple observations of the same individuals (n = 14) in flocks of different sizes over two consecutive months. The typical decline in vigilance with flock size occurred at the population level. Controlling for food density, flock size, time of year, and sex, we documented consistent individual differences in various measurements of vigilance. Plasticity of vigilance adjustments to variation in flock size occurred for the frequency of high vigilance postures. Male House Sparrows with larger bibs, which signal higher dominance status, tended to spend less time vigilant and obtained food at a higher rate, supporting a state-dependent explanation for the origin of individual vigilance profiles. Individual differences can contribute to explaining the large scatter in the relationship between vigilance and group size in many species."

However, the assumption of visual monitoring of vigilance has received little empirical scrutiny. Various treatments in a laboratory study manipulated the ability of zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata) foraging in pairs to monitor visually the vigilance of companions. In one treatment, the insertion of an uncovered partition allowed members of a pair to monitor, if needed, the vigilance of their companion. The addition of a partial cover to the partition in a further treatment eliminated any visual monitoring of vigilance by companions on either side of the partition while leaving the view from the rest of the cage unaltered. The final treatment, without a partition, allowed the feeding behaviour of unrestricted birds to be examined. As birds spent most of their time feeding or vigilant, feeding rate was considered a proxy for vigilance. After an initial difference in feeding rate across treatments, related perhaps to the novelty associated with the insertion of a partition, birds obtained food at a similar rate whether visual monitoring of vigilance was possible or not and whether individuals were physically separated or not. In agreement with recent empirical and theoretical findings, the study provides little evidence for visual monitoring of vigilance in birds."

The alpha female in each group exhibited significantly more vigilance behavior than all other members of her group.

Methods: i proposed and tested two hypotheses to explain this decline in vigilance. The safe experience hy- pothesis suggests the probability of a predator being nearby but undetected decreases with time spent in an area, enabling an animal to decrease its vigilance due to the reduced risk. The Visual experience hypothesis suggests that as time progresses vigilant animals acquire more informa- tion from their surroundings (e.g. refuge locations) allowing for a decrease in vigilance because an animal would not need to detect a predator as early if reaching a refuge required less time. grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) were used to test these hypotheses by feeding them peanut butter in an apparatus that limited their access to visual information by varying degrees. results: An effect of familiarity was evident by a sharp decline in vigilance rates within trials. squirrels adjusted vigilance postures to the different treatments, but the rate of decline in vigilance was unaffected by treatment. discussion: while vigilance is related to visual information, the decline in vigilance with familiarity is not related to the amount of visual information obtained from the environment, giving provisional support to the safe experience hypothesis."

I explored the effect of age and group size on vigilance in a precocial species, the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus). I recorded vigilance in groups of various sizes in juveniles and one year later in adults. Vigilance decreased with group size in juveniles and to a lesser extent in adults. Juveniles tested alone showed longer feeding and vigilance bouts than adults reflecting their inexperience with predation threats and more rapid satiation, respectively. Adults in larger groups were more vigilant reflecting the need to monitor aggressive conspecifics in addition to predators. Gradual acquisition of information about risk posed by predators and conspecifics and feeding constraints influenced the expression of vigilance as a function of age in this species."

However, as vigilance is used for both predator detection and obtaining social information, individuals must decide how to divide their time between these two vigilance types. Yet, it is unclear (1) how prey species living in the centre and edge of groups prioritize their use of these different vigilance types and (2) how this prioritization varies with increasing risk. To explore this, we focused on the degree to which impala, Aepyceros melampus, a herd-living antelope, adjusted their antipredator (looking out from the herd) and social (looking at herd members) vigilance across three sites with different predator guilds and predator densities. We found that as predator types and densities increased, herd size increased, but that impala did not adjust the total time they spent vigilant (antipredator plus social vigilance). Thus, they did not sacrifice other fitness-enhancing activities (e.g. foraging) to increase vigilance. Yet, overall, within the herds, edge individuals displayed greater total vigilance (antipredator plus social) and showed a greater proportional use of antipredator vigilance compared to central individuals. With increasing predator numbers, edge individuals maintained and ultimately increased their proportional use of antipredator vigilance. In contrast, central individuals reduced their use of antipredator vigilance and increased social vigilance. As suggested elsewhere, this adjustment might have been related to these individuals trying to increase foraging efficiency and cohesion benefits. However, they may have also monitored conspecifics to detect threats, while obtaining both short(e.g. less time spent in a vulnerable head-down position) and long-term (e.g. reduced daily foraging time allowing more time for less vulnerable activities) anti predator benefits. Ultimately, our results highlight that herd position and predator differences can influence overall vigilance levels and how individuals adjust their use of antipredator and social vigilance.

To elucidate the influences of conspecific factors, this study examined vigilance behaviour in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. Vigilance level was lower during foraging than during resting, which indicated a conflict between vigilance and foraging activity. In addition, vigilance level was higher when chimpanzees were on the ground where an encounter with leopards (Panthera pardus) is likely than when the chimpanzees were in trees. Males, but not females, increased their level of vigilance as the number of individuals within 3 m increased. In both males and females, daily party size - an index of group cohesion - did not affect the vigilance level. The level of maternal vigilance was higher when a dependent infant was separated from its mother than when the offspring was in contact with its mother. Both males and females increased their vigilance when a less-associated group member was nearby, when compared with when there was no less-associated group member nearby. This finding suggests that variation in relationship quality influences the vigilance level and that individuals need to increase their level of vigilance when the level of within-group threats is high. This study indicated that variation in vigilance cannot be understood unless conspecific factors, such as variation in the relationship quality with associates, are considered."

One way for this behavioural similarity to occur is through the contagious spread of behaviours. However, there is significant variation in reported rates of behavioural contagion, and the mechanisms governing the spread of a behaviour from one individual to the next are not clear. Why is a behaviour sometimes contagious to a neighbouring individual, and other times not? Here, we examine the contagiousness of vigilance behaviour in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) to determine whether particular characteristics of the vigilance bout affect the probability of contagion. We also investigate whether the vigilance characteristics differ between induced and routine vigilance, and thus might be reliable indicators for the presence of a relevant external stimulus. Results indicate that induced vigilance bouts involve significantly shorter head raise durations, longer first fixed gazes, and higher rates of chewing cessation in comparison to routine vigilance bouts. A fourth variable, looking in single or multiple directions before returning to grazing, did not differ between induced and routine vigilance. Interestingly, chewing cessation was the only one of four variables that predicted whether a vigilance bout would be contagious to a neighbouring sheep. These findings indicate that particular characteristics of a behaviour can affect whether a behaviour spreads to neighbouring individuals. Results are discussed in terms of both attention and learning as potential mechanisms regulating the spread of behaviour between social partners, in addition to providing new insight regarding the potential costs of vigilance behaviour.The contagious spread of behaviours is essential for group cohesion and coordination; however, little is known about why some behaviours spread and others do not. Here, we examine whether particular characteristics of a behaviour affect whether it spreads to a neighbouring individual. Using vigilance behaviour in bighorn sheep as our study system, we first demonstrate that the characteristics of vigilance behaviour differ depending on whether the vigilance behaviour was routine or induced (by an external stimulus). We then demonstrate that one of the defining characteristics of induced vigilance (whether an individual ceases chewing at the onset of a vigilance bout) increases the chance of the behaviour spreading to neighbouring individuals. Results suggest that variation in the way that a behaviour is performed can affect how contagious it is."

Adjustments in vigilance patterns in species that also forage at night are poorly known. Birds may forage at night to evade predation or other sources of disturbance, in which case levels of vigilance are expected to decrease at night. However, low visibility at night, especially on moonless nights, may compromise visual detection of predators, in which case levels of vigilance are expected to increase at night. We examined the effect of time of day on vigilance in non-breeding Greater Flamingos foraging in a tropical lagoon complex in Venezuela. Vigilance increased on darker nights but overall levels of vigilance at night did not differ from daytime values. Vigilance decreased with group size in a similar fashion both during day and night. Flamingos foraged in smaller flocks at night than during the day. The occurrence of small flocks, in which vigilance was quite high, and the increase in vigilance on dark nights imply that the amount of time allocated to foraging must be generally lower at night in flamingos. The results suggest that the night was not perceived as safer by foraging flamingos, and that visual detection of predators was probably compromised by low light levels."

We studied Eurasian Wigeon (Anas penelope) while they grazed on dry land, a 'risky' foraging situation, at two points during the winter period (pre- and post-pair formation) to assess if their behaviour was more consistent with one of these three hypotheses. Males were always highly vigilant, and vigilance increased markedly in more risky situations (smaller groups, greater distance from water). Mean male vigilance only changed to a minor extent from the pre- to the post-mating periods. Conversely, female vigilance significantly decreased after pairing, and was then significantly lower than that of males. Prior to pairing, males and females had similar rates of vigilance bouts. Overall, our findings suggest that higher vigilance in male Wigeon in this instance is best explained by the female benefits hypothesis. Because the Wigeon were foraging on land and were highly vigilant, even when unpaired, the females could actually benefit from the males' vigilance without males investing more time in vigilance. In such a situation, paired males rely on 'low-cost vigilance' whereby vigilance serves as a safety mechanism while simultaneously benefitting the female."

Relatively little is known about the effect of conspecifics on vigilance in non-obligate social species or the influence of sociality itself on antipredator tactics. We investigated predator avoidance behaviour in the yellow mongoose, Cynictis penicillata, a group-living solitary forager, and compared it with a sympatric group-living, group-foraging herpestid, the meerkat, Suricata suricatta. In yellow mongooses, the presence of conspecifics during foraging-an infrequent occurrence-reduced their foraging time and success and increased individual vigilance, contrary to the classical group-size effect. Comparing the two herpestids, sociality did not appear to affect overt vigilance or survival rates but influenced general patterns of predator avoidance. Whereas meerkats relied on communal vigilance, costly vigilance postures, and auditory warnings against danger, yellow mongooses avoided predator detection by remaining close to safe refuges and increasing low-cost vigilance, which did not interfere with foraging. We suggest that foraging group size in herpestids is constrained by species-distinct vigilance patterns, in addition to habitat and prey preference."

We investigated the functions of vigilance behaviour in wild spotted hyaenas. These large carnivores have few predators but face frequent threats of attack and food theft by conspecifics. We made repeated observations of vigilance behaviour by hyaenas when they were resting, feeding and nursing, and examined variation due to age, group size, social rank, and factors related to predation risk. We used these observations to test whether vigilance functions in hyaenas to detect prey, mates, conspecific threats or interspecific threats, and whether functions differ between juveniles and adults. We found that adults were more vigilant than juveniles in all contexts. Vigilance by adults was greatest when nursing, but nursing females reduced their vigilance as cubs matured. Among both age groups, vigilance decreased with increasing group size, and hyaenas were less vigilant when feeding on high-quality food than when feeding on low-quality food. Social rank did not affect vigilance in either age group. Individual adults, but not juveniles, showed consistent patterns of vigilance within, but not between, behavioural contexts. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the primary function of vigilance in hyaenas is to detect interspecific threats. Furthermore, vigilance was context specific, and adult hyaenas showed individual variation in vigilance within behavioural contexts.

As a result, per capita risk of predation decreases and individuals allocate more time to foraging and other fitness rewarding activities. Reduction of per capita risk is hypothesized to occur because there are more individuals to detect potential predators. If so, collective (i.e. total) vigilance is expected to increase with foraging group size. Increased surveillance during group foraging may occur if group members scan independently of one another, or sequentially to avoid the overlapping of their vigilance bouts. Intriguingly, such coordinated vigilance assumes that individuals monitor not only the presence, but the vigilance behaviour of group mates. We used seasonal records on time budget and grouping patterns of individually marked degus (Octodon degus), a social rodent, to examine if (a) individual vigilance decreases and/or foraging increases with group size, (b) collective vigilance increases with group size and (c) foraging degus coordinate their vigilance. When foraging, degus decreased their individual vigilance and increased their foraging time when in larger groups. Despite this, degus in larger groups increased their collective vigilance, supporting the hypothesis that socially foraging degus decrease predation risk through an improved ability to detect and escape potential predators. Additionally, patterns of collective vigilance suggested that degus scan independently of each other and so, they do not coordinate their vigilance to prevent its temporal overlapping. This finding does not support that foraging degus monitor the vigilance activity of group mates."

Individual vigilance levels are thought to decrease as group size or the number of neighbours increases. However, the results of studies on the effects of group size or the number of neighbours are inconsistent, especially in primates. Since social vigilance (i.e. monitoring for group members) plays an essential role in group-living primates, discrepancies among studies may have been caused by differences in the quality of social relationships between group members. Using data from a provisioned group of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, this study examined the effects of the quality of social relationships and the number of neighbours on vigilance levels. We found that the frequency of vigilance was lower when the majority of an individual's neighbours were kin than when kin were in the minority. Since Japanese macaques show strong nepotism and cope with social threats by forming coalitions between close kin, individuals may be able to reduce their vigilance levels by relying on the vigilance of potential allies. Furthermore, when the majority of neighbours were kin, the proportion of time spent on vigilance decreased as the number of neighbours increased. However, when kin were in the minority of neighbours, the number of neighbours did not affect vigilance levels. Overall, our results indicate that the quality of social relationships with neighbours and the number of neighbours interactively affect vigilance levels.

Many methods for vigilance detection, based on biological and behavioural characteristics, have been proposed in the literature. In general, the existing approaches do not provide any solution to measure vigilance level quantitatively and adopt costly equipment. This paper utilizes a portable electroencephalography (EEG) device and presents a new method for estimation of vigilance level of an individual by utilizing event-related potentials (P300 and N100) of EEG signals and eye blink rate. Here, we propose a fuzzy rule-based system using amplitude and time variations of the N100 and P300 components and blink variability to establish the correlation among N100, P300, eye blink and the vigilance activity. We have shown, with the help of our proposed fuzzy model, we can efficiently calculate and quantify the vigilance level, and thereby obtain a numerical value of vigilance instead of its mere presence or absence. To validate the results obtained from our fuzzy model, we performed subjective analysis (for assessing the mood and stress level of participants), reaction time analysis and compared the vigilance values with target detection accuracy. The obtained results prove the efficacy of our proposal."

In diurnal species, vigilance is used to detect predators, resulting in a trade-off between feeding activity and predation risk. Species can reduce the cost of this trade-off with low-quality vigilance - performing another behaviour while vigilant - in comparison to high-quality vigilance (only being vigilant). Two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses explaining an inverse relationship between individual vigilance and group size are the dilution effect, where predation risk decreases in larger groups, and collective detection, where larger groups have more individuals that may detect a predator. Two predictions that support collective detection but not the dilution effect are that (1) overall group (collective) vigilance will increase with increasing group size, even while individual vigilance decreases, and (2) at least one group member must be vigilant to detect potential danger and communicate that information to group members. To test these predictions, we recorded behavioural data on low- and high-quality vigilance and alarm calling in the gregarious Barbary ground squirrel, Atlantoxerus getulus. Barbary ground squirrels allocated more time to high-quality vigilance than lowquality vigilance. The collective detection hypothesis was partly supported: as group size increased, individual low- and high-quality vigilance did not decrease, but collective high-quality vigilance did increase. Furthermore, we found that repetitive alarm calling warned group members of terrestrial threats. Our results show that this invasive species displays specific antipredator behaviours to different aerial and terrestrial predators compared to predators in their endemic range. The low level of time allocated to low-quality vigilance indicates that natural selection strongly favours high-quality vigilance in this species despite the trade-off with foraging. Our study broadens our understanding of antipredator and risk-sensitive behaviour. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

We analyzed video-recordings of birds that were foraging alone or in groups from two to 12 birds. The proportion of time allocated to individual vigilance decreased and the proportion of time spent feeding increased with group size. In both cases the main significant difference was between birds foraging alone and in groups. Collective vigilance did not vary with group size and it was lower than expected if vigilance bouts were random or sequential. Our results indicate that rheas foraging in large groups would not receive the benefit of an increase in collective vigilance, although they could still benefit from a reduction of predation risk by the dilution effect."

In the high predation site, rate of looking and proportion of time spent looking by both species was significantly greater than in the low predation site. Vigilance behaviour also showed an increase over time following felid reintroduction: there was no increase where re-introduced felids were absent. The relationship between vigilance and herd size, position in herd and presence of juveniles was compared for high and low predation conditions. Herd size and vigilance behaviour showed a negative correlation for both species regardless of predation conditions. Mothers with juveniles were always the most vigilant members of the herd and central animals were always the least watchful in both predation conditions. The interplay between vigilance behaviour and predation pressure, herd size, position in herd and presence of juveniles is discussed. It is suggested that predation pressure is the principal influence on vigilance behaviour in ungulates and even very low risk of predation appears to contribute to vigilance. Impalas and wildebeest spared the risk of predation devoted very little time to vigilance, suggesting it played a minor role in intraspecific interactions and finding food."

This phenomenon, called the group size effect, was studied in a natural population of the caviomorph rodent Octodon degus. Through field observations of groups of different size, I quantified the duration of bouts of vigilance and foraging. Results showed that degus spent significantly less time being vigilant as group size increased, which agrees with the group size effect. The reduction in vigilance was achieved through a decrease in the duration of vigilance bouts as well as in scanning rate. Further, foraging bouts of group members lasted longer with increasing group size. Total group vigilance also increased with group size. Degus adjusted their behavior in similar manner to that of other social feeding species. Time saved from vigilance was allocated to foraging. Group foraging may confer anti-predator as well as short-term feeding advantages to O. degus. Further studies in this area of research may help to understand the evolution of sociality in this species."

Pecking rate increased with distance from cover and was not affected by density. The only significant trend for vigilance rate was a decrease with distance from cover, which was counter to expectations. Increased vigilance towards conspecifics may have balanced any decrease in vigilance for predators as group size increased, or as distance from cover decreased."

We argue that these differences depend on individual differences in the performance costs of actually helping, the opportunity costs from forsaking alternative activities, and the fitness benefits for engaging the help. If helping is more difficult for some individuals to do (quality-dependent help), it will usually be done by high-quality individuals, whereas help that all individuals could do equally well (quality-independent help) will be done by whoever pays lower opportunity costs. Our model makes novel predictions about many kinds of helping, allows us to categorize different types of helping by their relationship with individual quality, and is general enough to apply to many situations. Furthermore, it can be generalized to any other type of (nonhelping) behavior where there are individual differences in benefits, performance costs, or opportunity costs."

To exclude competition for resources as a driving force in vigilance research into activities other than feeding is necessary. Additionally, variables such as nearest neighbour distance and position within a flock are supposed to influence vigilance and vigilance of singletons should be compared with vigilance of flock members. I studied vigilance during preening in Eurasian Coots (Fulica atra) and counted the number of scans per minute. A total number of 117 coots were sampled with 16 of them preening alone. Coots preening alone showed a significantly higher scan rate. I found a significant negative correlation between vigilance and flock size while nearest neighbour distance correlated positively with vigilance. Further, vigilance was higher in individuals at the edge. A general linear model using nearest neighbour distance and flock size within 10 m as covariates also revealed a significant influence of flock size but not of nearest neighbour distance. The centre-edge effect still remained significant. These results indicate that flock size is the most influential predictor of vigilance in preening coots, followed by spatial organization. However, using nearest neighbour distance instead of flock size also produced a significant model as did the flock size measurement within a radius of 20 m. As scramble competition could be ruled out, the flock size effect may be indeed related to predation."

We discuss the structure of scanning patterns. Scanning patterns show sequential predictability whose function remains unexplored. Scanning behaviour is more complex than assumed in current models of vigilance and we suggest that duration and shape of scanning movements are particularly important.

One male emigrated from each of three study, groups, providing ideal experimental conditions for examining the effect of coresident males on male vigilance behavior (social and nonsocial). Following the predator and conspecific defense theories for the adaptive value of male vigilance behavior and the occurrence of multimale groups, I predicted that male nonsocial vigilance would increase after the emigration of a coresident male. My prediction was supported in only one of the three study groups. Males in two groups decreased their nonsocial vigilance after the emigration of a coresident male, which was probably influenced by seasonal changes and the peripherality, of one group's coresident male before his emigration. The social vigilance hypothesis proposes that for species with rigid dominance hierarchies, social vigilance should increase with an increase in same sex competitors. Therefore, I predicted that male social vigilance would decrease after the emigration of a coresident male. The hypothesis is generally supported in my findings, as two of the three groups displayed a decrease in social vigilance after the emigration of a coresident male. Increased social vigilance in the third group is best explained by, the change in the alpha male social behavior after the emigration of his only, coresident male."

We studied red-crowned cranes (Grus japonensis) in Yancheng Biosphere Reserve, China, to examine changes in the allocation of time to vigilance as a function of flock size in areas with different levels of human disturbance. There was low level of human activity in the core area of the reserve whereas more human activity occurred in the buffer zone. Vigilance decreased linearly with flock size but to significantly different extent in the two areas, with a more pronounced decrease in the more disturbed area. In smaller crane flocks, vigilance was higher in the more disturbed area. Vigilance also varied in a non-linear fashion with flock size first decreasing and then increasing in larger flocks. Increase in vigilance in larger flocks was accompanied by an increase in fighting suggesting that vigilance in large flocks was aimed partly at monitoring rivals. The effect of human disturbance on vigilance suggests that less time is available for foraging in more disturbed areas. Nevertheless, moving to less disturbed areas may not be an option for the cranes given the increase in vigilance that would probably occur in areas with more cranes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies of social vigilance often consider how group size or nearby conspecifics influence vigilance levels. Less is known about how more specific social variables, such as relative rank and kinship of a subject's neighbours, affect vigilance of wild animals along with predation risk. To evaluate alternative functional hypotheses for vigilance behaviour, including predator detection and both extra-and within-group conspecific monitoring, we investigated how predation risk and social factors account for variation in vigilance in wild blue monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis, which show strong aggressive competition between groups and mild aggression within them. Studying 18 adult females in two groups, we measured time spent vigilant in 90 s focal samples, recording the subject's activity, microhabitat conditions and identity of neighbours. We used data on dominance ranks and kinship to assess subject-specific social context for each sample. We compared generalized linear mixed models corresponding to each hypothesized function of vigilance, relating variation in vigilance to factors associated with a particular function. The best model related vigilance to predictor variables of all three functions, including recency of an antipredator event, height in canopy, position in forest (edge/interior), recency of an intergroup encounter, number of nearby kin, subject rank and presence of high-ranking neighbours. Overall, most variation in vigilance related to predation risk and between-group competition, while within-group social factors had smaller effects. The range of predictors suggests that vigilance behaviour serves multiple functions, including predator detection and both extragroup and intragroup conspecific monitoring.

Behavioral monitoring of conspecifics remains controversial although synchronization is commonly observed and need not compromise predator detection. The within-group timing of vigilance shows inconsistent associations with group size, and whether nearby nongroup conspecifics affect this timing is poorly understood. Finally, it is unknown whether socially breeding parents time their activities to each other based on offspring predation risk. We studied diving common eider females (Somateria mollissima) in brood-rearing coalitions subject to gull predation of ducklings. The within-group timing of vigilance was determined by comparing observed collective vigilance, the proportion of time during which at least 1 adult group member is vigilant, with that expected assuming independent timing of activities. We determined the predictors of within-group timing of vigilance, observed collective vigilance, individual vigilance, frequency of nearby nongroup females (group outsiders), and incidence of alarm reactions. Vigilance was synchronized regardless of brood composition. Synchronization and observed collective vigilance increased with female group size, whereas synchronization decreased with increasing ratios of ducklings to tending females. Individual vigilance increased in the presence of gull alarms. Within-group timing of activities was unrelated to the presence of group outsiders, but broods with fewer ducklings (less predation dilution) were more often associated with group outsiders, the frequency of which was negatively associated with the incidence of gull alarms. Increased offspring predation risk thus reduces overlapping vigilance among adult group members and enhances attraction to nearby nongroup conspecifics."

Females performed longer grazing bouts, pecked with a higher rate and were vigilant for shorter periods than males. The length of grazing bouts and peck rate in males decreased, whereas their length of vigilance bouts increased, with distance from water. In females, length of grazing and vigilance bouts and peck rate were independent of distance from water. We conclude that Wigeon generally feed close to water because they may be in more riskier areas when they move further ashore. The decreasing length of grazing bouts and increasing length of vigilance bouts in mates with increasing distance from water, is explained by potential differences in predation pressure between the sexes."

However, group size alone will not always reliably determine the optimal level of vigilance. For example, variation in predation risk or food quality between patches may also be influential. In a field setting, we assessed how simultaneous variation in predation risk and intake rate affects the relationship between vigilance and group size in foraging Ruddy Turnstones Arenaria interpres. We compared vigilance, measured as the number of head-ups' per unit time, in habitat types that differed greatly in prey energy content and proximity to cover from which predators could launch surprise attacks. Habitats closer to predator cover provided foragers with much higher potential net energy intake rates than habitats further from cover. Foragers formed larger and denser flocks on habitats closer to cover. Individual vigilance of foragers in all habitats declined with increasing flock size and increased with flock density. However, vigilance by foragers on habitats closer to cover was always higher for a given flock size than vigilance by foragers on habitats further from cover, and habitat remained an important predictor of vigilance in models including a range of potential confounding variables. Our results suggest that foraging Ruddy Turnstones can simultaneously assess information on group size and the general likelihood of predator attack when determining their vigilance contribution."

Decrease of vigilance with increasing group size was observed for females and adult males, but not for young and subadult males, suggesting that group-size effects on vigilance were not consistent across individuals of different sex/age classes. Most likely, females tended to reduce the predation risk for their offspring through a comparatively greater duration and frequency of vigilance. Young/subadult males showed a greater alertness than adult males, which may depend on intraspecific competition in larger groups.

Fall-staging sandpipers face time constraints, as individuals must accumulate fat rapidly before undertaking their long migration south. Controlling for known correlates of vigilance, such as distance to obstructive cover, bird density, and position in the flock, the frequency of looks decreased as predicted when the density of food in a patch was higher. That vigilance can vary with food density is relevant for observational studies of vigilance. When food density is positively correlated with group size, food density can become a confounding factor in the well-known negative relationship between vigilance and group size."
"Beauchamp, Guy; Ruxton, Graeme D.",Dilution games: use of protective cover can cause a reduction in vigilance for prey in groups,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,18,1040,1044,10.1093/beheco/arm073,2007,"Antipredatory vigilance usually decreases in groups. The generally accepted collective detection'' explanation implies that because there are more eyes to scan the surroundings for predators, individuals in a group can lower their personal investment in vigilance without increasing their predation risk. The role of other factors, such as numerical risk dilution caused by the mere presence of companions, has been neglected. In a model, we explore a dilution game when foragers in groups have access to protective cover. We show that foragers can take advantage of risk dilution and that this leads to changes in vigilance with group size without the need to invoke collective detection. We identify a cost to maintaining high levels of vigilance as less vigilant foragers gather food faster and so depart the group sooner (to reach cover) leaving more vulnerable stragglers behind. In groups, there is a scramble to reach safe sites that can induce a reduction in vigilance levels. Such a mechanism operates less forcefully in large groups because individuals in these groups are less vulnerable to the departure of an individual. We also demonstrate that individuals should adopt lower levels of vigilance, to reach safe sites sooner, when predator evasion is compromised or when the rate of food intake is high. The model provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying changes in vigilance with group size in animals."

Many social and environmental factors influence vigilance, including sex, predation risk and group size. During the summer of 2007, we studied Przewalski's gazelle Procapra przewalskii, an endemic ungulate to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, to test whether and how these three factors affect vigilance. We distinguished groups consisting of males, mothers with lambs and females without lambs making observations on groups in the presence or absence of nearby predators. We assessed the group-size effect on vigilance and how this varied with levels of predation risk and sex. Males and mothers scanned longer and with a higher frequency than females without lambs. Individuals were more vigilant under direct predation threat. Although vigilance generally decreased with group size, the extent of the decrease was independent of predation risk and was not significant in males. The results suggest that mothers are more vigilant suggesting greater vulnerability and that males may have increased their vigilance to compete for higher social ranks. The positive correlation between vigilance and predation risk and the negative correlation between vigilance and group size are consistent with earlier findings, but we failed to find an interaction between group size and predation risk on vigilance perhaps because vigilance levels are low even in small groups, thus making similar vigilant upward adjustments in both small and large groups."

Within a single day, the percentage of observations when an individual was scanning for predators ranged from 0-100%, with a mean of 24.4%. Over a period of 3 months, some individuals were vigilant for <5% of observations, but others were vigilant for >50% of observations. For 12 of 24 individuals that we monitored for vigilance in consecutive years, levels of vigilance were significantly different between years. Some of the variation within and between individuals might have resulted from differences in vulnerability to predation."

These potential benefits and costs of vigilance may not be equal among different genders and age classes foraging together. We observed male and female elk from 3 age classes (yearlings, nonreproductive, reproductive) during 2 seasons (calving season, breeding season) that vary in social interactions (i.e., conspecific risk) and in 2 regions of Yellowstone National Park that varied in predation risk due to density of wolves. This study was designed to determine the potential functional benefit of vigilance across a range of herd sizes. If vigilance serves to monitor the behavior of conspecifics, we expected it to increase in the fall breeding season along with aggressive behaviors, regardless of changes in predation risk. If vigilance serves to detect predators, we expected it to increase in regions with wolves regardless of changes in conspecific risk. Adult male vigilance and aggression increased during the fall breeding season, but yearling males had significantly lower levels of vigilance. Adult female vigilance increased during the calving season, with increasing predator encounter risk, decreasing herd size, and edge position within the herd. Yearling female vigilance decreased with herd size but was lower than adult females. We conclude that the primary benefit of vigilance for male elk is to monitor conspecifics, but the primary benefit of vigilance for female elk is to detect potential predators."

The ''many-eyes'' hypothesis predicts a reduction in vigilance levels in larger groups that can cause higher feeding rates if the time thus saved is used for foraging. We adopted a within-subject procedure whereby in each of six replicates we observed one adult male searching for food in groups varying in size from one to five. As predicted, vigilance levels decreased with group size up to four birds but increased in groups of five. Birds also collected seeds more quickly in larger groups, reflecting (i) a decrease in vigilance levels in larger groups, (ii) a decrease in handling time, and (iii) an increase in search speed. Nearest neighbour distances were smaller in larger groups, a potential confounding factor in the analysis of vigilance time. Although the results are partly consistent with the many-eyes hypothesis, we suggest that the arrow of causation from vigilance to feeding time could be reversed: the increase in feeding rates in larger groups, with a concomitant decrease in vigilance levels, would be caused by increased competition."

Matched comparisons were then conducted to test six predictions for each functional explanation (survival or reproduction). These relate vigilance to (1) sex, (2) group size, (3) activity, (4) habitat, (5) refuge use and (6) spacing behaviour. Vigilance levels do not differ between sexes or groups. However, females are more vigilant when engaged in high-risk activities, when distant from refuges and when distant from neighbours. Male vigilance similarly covaries with refuge use and spacing behaviour, but males are not always more vigilant in dangerous activities and show greater vigilance in open rather than closed habitats. According to the predictions tested, the results provide partial support for the proposal that vigilance plays a role in predator detection for both sexes, although in males the detection of potential mates and competitors appears to be of greater importance. There was no evidence that males provide a vigilance service for females. Vigilance patterns are complicated by activity constraints and the multifactorial nature of anti-predator strategies."

This form of wildlife viewing has provided a unique and safe way for tourists to learn about polar bears. However, these activities have largely been carried out without examining possible effects on polar bear behaviour. We studied vigilance behaviour (a scanning of the immediate vicinity and beyond) of resting polar bears to evaluate impacts from tundra vehicle activity. Focal animal sampling was used to examine whether a difference in vigilance behaviour existed when vehicles were present. We recorded the numbers of head-ups, vigilance bout length, and between-bout intervals for polar bears. In general, the frequency of head-ups increased, and the between-bout intervals decreased for male bears, when vehicles were present. Female bears behaved opposite to males. The vigilance bout lengths did not differ significantly between vehicle presence and absence. Vigilance behaviour of male bears was not magnified with increasing numbers of vehicles; therefore the threshold is one vehicle. We suggest that manipulative studies be conducted to examine how distances between vehicles and bears, tundra vehicle activity in the immediate vicinity of a bear during viewing, and noise of tourists affect increased vigilance.

To compensate for the increased risk while sleeping, many bird species have evolved eye-blinking strategies called peeking, which allows vigilance to persist in a sleep-like state. However, the drivers of vigilance behaviour during sleep have rarely been explored. We investigated how social factors, anthropogenic disturbance and environmental conditions affected the sleep-vigilance trade-off in the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus). Data were collected on the frequency, total duration and average duration of peeking at two locations on the Menai Strait, North Wales. Our results reveal that exposure to anthropogenic disturbance, particularly the presence of people exercising dogs, led to an increase in vigilance duration and reduced time sleeping, while increasing boat traffic resulted in elevated levels of peek frequency, but the overall duration of vigilance was in fact reduced. Furthermore, oystercatchers adjust their vigilance behaviour according to social context, with reduced levels of individual vigilance when a greater number of animals were present. However, if surrounding neighbours were awake - then the observed animal was more likely to be alert, demonstrating the importance of monitoring the behaviour of conspecifics. Likewise, the temperature and wind speed influenced vigilance with elevated levels of peek frequency observed in warmer and windier conditions. Oystercatchers are able to make fine-scale adjustments to their vigilance behaviour while asleep, which reduces the risk of external threats such as predators. Nevertheless, they are making these decisions against the backdrop of a finely balanced energy budget, particularly during the winter months. Increased levels of human activity and disturbance may elevate the costs of vigilance and ultimately have fitness implications for this species."

Antipredator vigilance is an important component of survival for many prey animals in their natural habitat. Do deer still adjust vigilance as a function of risk after such a long period of relaxed predation pressure? Here, we examined vigilance levels in Pere David's deer groups as a function of group size, sex and level of human disturbance. The results showed that individual vigilance significantly decreased with group size in all-female groups but not in all-males or mixed-sex groups. In rutting season, males compete with one another and harass females, and we argue that vigilance is partly aimed at threatening males and that such vigilance increases with group size. This explains why overall vigilance did not vary with group size for males in general and for females in mixed-sex groups. Vigilance increased in more disturbed areas but in in male deer only. The results indicate that despite relaxed predation pressure over centuries, Pere David's deer can still adjust antipredator responses as a function of perceived risk. Such information may become useful in the rewilding programme now under way for this species in China [Current Zoology 59 (2): 265-270, 2013]."

A group size effect on vigilance is seldom seen in primates, perhaps because scanning and feeding often occur simultaneously or because the distinction between routine and induced vigilance has not been investigated. We analyzed feeding and resting observations separately while distinguishing between routine and induced scans in four groups of wild ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus) experiencing scramble competition for food and infanticide risk. We used linear mixed-effect models to test the effect of group size, age-sex class, number of neighbors, number of adult male neighbors, and height in the canopy on scanning rates (vigilance) with and without evident conspecific threat. Food type was also examined in the feeding models. Perceived predation risk affected vigilance more than scramble competition for food and infanticide risk. Routine and induced vigilance were greatest at lower canopy heights during feeding and resting and increased when individuals had fewer neighbors while resting. A group size effect was found on induced vigilance while resting, but scanning increased with group size, which probably indicates visual monitoring of conspecifics. Scanning rates decreased while feeding on foods that required extensive manipulation. This supports the idea that vigilance is relatively cost free for upright feeders when eating food that requires little manipulation, a common feature of folivore diets. In the presence of threatening conspecific males, close proximity to resident males decreased individual vigilance, demonstrating the defensive role of these males in the group."

Alternatively, predation cannot be responsible for habitat partitioning if all species rank the safety of habitats similarly. I developed predictions to test these two hypotheses, using data on the rates at which animals scan the environment for predators while they forage. Preliminary results suggest that predation is unlikely to be responsible for the habitat preferences of sparrow species wintering along an elevational gradient in the Sonoran Desert of southern California, USA.Two predictions can be tested using vigilance behavior. (1) If species differ in which habitats they are safest from predation, some species will experience increased risk when moved from one habitat to another, whereas other species will experience decreased risk; changes in vigilance levels between habitats will be inconsistent among species. (2) If species are safest in the same habitat, they will experience similar changes in risk between habitats, and should exhibit similar changes in vigilance levels between habitats.Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli) and Black-throated Sparrows (A. bilineata) spend the winter in different habitats. I recorded vigilance levels in each habitat while birds foraged on naturally occurring seeds in a portable aviary. Sage Sparrows and Black-throated Sparrows exhibited similar changes in vigilance between habitats, suggesting that these two species are safest in the same habitat, and that predation is unlikely to explain their habitat preferences.Also, I tested and found support for the prediction from vigilance theory that food abundance affects vigilance level. Vigilance declined in response to increased foraging patch profitability, counter to the intuitive prediction that increased food abundance relaxes the threat of starvation, allowing more time for vigilance. This relationship between abundance and vigilance is explained by a simple model of starvation."

This relationship is thought to ultimately result in higher reproductive success for females paired with highly vigilant males. However, previous research has not examined the behavioural mechanism that produces the correlation between male vigilance and rates of female foraging. Foraging females may take advantage of vigilance that males are using for other purposes. Alternatively, the purpose of male vigilance may be to increase females' ability to forage. We examined these alternatives by testing whether vigilance preceded or followed bouts of female foraging more often than would occur by chance alone, using simultaneous behaviour observations of pre-incubation pairs of white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus). Our results indicate that each member of a pair may influence the behaviour of the other. Females were more likely to initiate foraging bouts after males became vigilant than if their mate remained non-vigilant. Moreover, non-vigilant males were more likely to become vigilant if their mate was foraging than if she was engaged in some other activity. Despite the possibility that a sexual conflict exists as each member of a pair attempts to maximize its fitness, both sexes behave as though a major role of male vigilance is to enhance female foraging opportunities."

We tested this hypothesis in wild spider monkeys, which live in communities but fission and fuse in subgroups of variable size and membership throughout the same day.

However, a possible explanation is that vigilance may be effectively shared only with individuals in close proximity, rather than with all subgroup members.

As behaviors are time costly, there is a tradeoff between vigilance and feeding behavior. Male vigilance can be regarded as a male investment in their mates and may benefit the female by reducing the danger of predation, increasing her probability of survival, and allowing more time for her to forage to obtain more resources for egg production and incubation. In this study, we documented the proportion of time spent in vigilance and feeding by Chinese grouse Tetrastes sewerzowi with their mates and alone during the pre-incubation period, and then estimated male vigilance under more severe predation pressures through predator call playback. Our results indicated that paired male Chinese grouse spend more time in vigilance than unpaired males and paired females and could alter their activity budgets in response to the social context (i.e. with and without their mate) and an experimental encounter with an important predator. Male vigilance behavior and presence allowed females to spend more time foraging. We therefore conclude that vigilance behavior by their male partners by may play an important role in promoting the females' survival and probably the reproductive success. The proportion of time allocated for vigilance by males and foraging by females of Chinese grouse during the pre-incubation period was the highest recorded among monogamous grouse species, perhaps because the Chinese grouse is the smallest grouse species and has the highest relative reproductive investment."

The minimum distance to such a conspecific competitor that an animal considers safe is usually lower than to a predator, whereas the frequency of encounters with conspecifics is higher. Therefore, the acquisition of information about a predator or about a conspecific could lead to the existence of at least two different modes of vigilance behaviour. The aim of the present study was to describe and compare different forms of vigilance behaviour that European rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, display in anti-predator and social contexts. We conducted an observational study on individually marked animals from a field enclosure population. We recorded social interactions of the animals, the presence of aerial predators (common buzzard Buteo buteo), and the vigilance behaviour of the rabbits. We distinguished between two forms of vigilance of different intensity: subtle and overt. The frequencies of both forms of vigilance displayed by the rabbits differed significantly in occurrence, duration, and distribution over time. Females and males showed higher frequencies of overt but not subtle vigilance when buzzards were present. In contrast, the presence of conspecifics in close proximity affected the display of subtle but not overt vigilance: males increased the frequency of subtle vigilance when other males were close. Females increased subtle vigilance in proximity of males and females; however, this effect was only apparent in females with a more unstable social situation. In conclusion, European rabbits differentially increased two different forms of vigilance behaviour in social and anti-predator contexts."

Small animals are more vulnerable than large ones, so the former are expected to behave more vigilantly than the latter. This effect of body size on vigilance may occur inter- or intraspecifically. We studied the vigilance behavior of two sympatric wild ungulates, Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsonii) and Tibetan gazelles (Procapra picticaudata). Tibetan antelopes, with a body size of 33 kg are much larger than Tibetan gazelles, with a body size of approximately 14 kg. Tibetan antelopes are sexually and body-size dimorphic; that is, males are much heavier than females. Alternately, Tibetan gazelles are sexually dimorphic but the sexes do not differ in weight. Tibetan gazelles scanned their environment more frequently than Tibetan antelopes did. Small female Tibetan antelopes scanned their environment more frequently than males did, whereas male Tibetan gazelles scanned their environment more frequently than females did. Group size did not affect the vigilance of Tibetan gazelle, but its negative effect on the vigilance of male Tibetan antelopes was marginally significant. In female Tibetan antelopes, vigilance in large groups was high probably because of scramble competition and social monitoring. Our results suggested that body mass and group size play an important role in shaping the vigilance of these two rare Tibetan ungulates."

This trade-off can be influenced by variation in many environmental, social and individual traits. Our aim was to test the relationship between individual-level traits, including boldness, body condition and reproductive state, and vigilance, while controlling for environmental and social variables. Using multiple 5-min video samples of 30 foraging, individually recognisable, female eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) at Sundown National Park in Queensland, we investigated individual-level variation in the duration, intensity and target of vigilance behaviour during foraging. On separate occasions, we used flight-initiation distance tests to measure boldness in our kangaroos. Females with longer flight-initiation distances (shyer females) spent more time vigilant, providing preliminary support for studies of animal personality that have suggested that boldness may covary with vigilance. Body condition did not affect the total time spent vigilant, but females in poorer body condition spent more of their vigilance time in low-intensity vigilance. Vigilance patterns were not related to reproductive state, but varied among months and differed between mornings and afternoons, and females spent more time in high-intensity vigilance when further from cover. Even after accounting for all our variables we found that 7% of the variation in total time vigilant and 14% of the variation in vigilance intensity was explained by individual identity. This highlights the importance of individual-level variation in vigilance behaviour."

Two hypotheses to explain the function of male vigilance before onset of incubation were examined in white-tailed ptarmigan. The protection of paternity hypothesis proposes that male vigilance minimizes the threat of cuckoldry, thereby ensuring paternity in a reproductive attempt. Thus, male vigilance should be greatest during periods when females are fertile, and it should increase when the sex ratio is male-biased. The predator detection hypothesis predicts that increasing male vigilance decreases predation risk to their mates and thus may allow females to increase foraging efficiency. The percentage of time males spent in vigilant behaviour during the pre-incubation period did not change significantly with period of female fertility or with the sex ratio of breeding birds. However, males spent significantly more time vigilant in the year when there were more sightings of predators. The proportion of time females spent foraging was positively correlated with the proportion of time their mates were vigilant. Vigilant behaviour before onset of incubation is likely to increase a male's confidence in paternity of that nesting attempt in white-tailed ptarmigan. However, patterns of variation in male vigilance across seasons and between years suggests that this behaviour also functions to allow females to reduce their vigilance for predators, thereby enabling them to forage more effectively before incubation."

Vigilance can involve either scanning for predators (antipredator vigilance) or watching conspecifics (social vigilance). From observations of marked Gunnison's prairie dogs, Cynomys gunnisoni (Sciuridae), living under natural conditions at Valles Caldera National Preserve, New Mexico, U.S.A., we compared results from the two most common sampling methods used by behavioural ecologists to measure vigilance: focal sampling (i.e. observing an individual for a specific amount of time and recording the amount of time spent vigilant) and scan sampling (i.e. observing all individuals in an area at a single moment and recording whether each individual at that moment is vigilant or nonvigilant). Information from different individuals and from the same individuals over time both revealed that estimates of vigilance from scan sampling were consistently and significantly higher than estimates from focal sampling. These differences probably resulted because nonvigilant behaviours were more difficult to detect in scan samples than in focal samples. Our results have important implications for behavioural ecologists who want to make intraspecific or interspecific comparisons of vigilance.

Subjects were lesser cavies (Microcavia australis), a social species that is semi-fossorial, diurnal, and native to South America. Continuous focal sampling was conducted during the day, at times of food shortage, food abundance, and reproduction from 2003 to 2005. The proportion of time spent vigilance was significantly higher at AacuAn, where vigilance peaked at midday and reached a minimum in the evening. This midday peak of vigilance at AacuAn was associated with a midday peak of danger from raptors as indicated by a raptor activity peak at that time. In contrast, both vigilance and predator activity at El Leoncito were constant through the day. Records of intermittent locomotion and number and duration of pauses in locomotion were significantly higher at El Leoncito, a difference that may have been due to the need for greater vigilance while moving across areas of less protective cover at this site."

Given that large groups often aggregate in areas of higher food density and that vigilance may be reduced when animals feed more, the group-size effect of vigilance may be confounded by the direct effect of food density on vigilance. In this paper, I examine the theoretical expectations regarding the effect of food density on vigilance and review the available empirical evidence. Two bodies of theory predict either no relationship or a negative relationship between vigilance and food density, but none has been tested explicitly. The empirical support for a negative relationship is mixed given that many studies actually document a positive correlation between vigilance and food density. I review the factors modulating the effect of food density on vigilance and show that there are several reasons to believe that the case against a confounding effect of food density is not as strong as expected. In fact, food density can actually mask the expected decrease in vigilance with group size. A statement about the magnitude of the group-size effect on vigilance will require an assessment of the role of food density as well as the many factors reviewed here that modulate the effect of food density on vigilance in birds and mammals.

This paper presents evidence that scanning is associated with the high incidence of intra-specific food stealing among mussel-eating Oystercatchers. Scanning increased in frequency as bird density - and the risk of being attacked for mussels - increased and the duration of attacks decreased. Additionally, among a sample of individually marked adults, the aggressive dominant birds spent half as much time scanning as the less aggressive subdominants and were also less likely to be attacked. Whereas detecting an attack made no difference to the success with which the dominants defended their mussels, subdominants increased their chances of retaining the mussel if they detected and carried the mussel away from the approaching attacker. The extra time which the less aggressive birds spent in vigilance seems best understood as a tactic for reducing food loss to kleptoparasites."

The optimal level of a forager's vigilance should be affected by its encounter rate with predators and the effectiveness of its vigilance in reducing mortality risk. The physical structure of the environment can alter the effectiveness of its vigilance and therefore alter its foraging behaviour. We tested this for gerbils at risk of predation from barn owls or foxes in a large vivarium. In particular, we reduced the effectiveness of vigilance by placing obstructions around feeding trays that blocked sight lines along either the vertical (vigilance directed against owls) or horizontal axis (vigilance directed against foxes), thereby changing the physical structure of the environment. In addition, we manipulated the presence of foxes and owls. In general, gerbils harvested fewer seeds, allocated less time to foraging in dangerous patches, and used more vigilance while foraging where and when risks were higher (i.e. in the presence of predators and in bright moonlight). Vertical and horizontal sightline treatments interacted synergistically to further raise perceived risk.These results imply that blocking sight lines reduces the effectiveness of vigilance, causing gerbils to use it less. Moreover, in the presence of a predator, the gerbils 'response to the blocked sightlines was more severe - harvesting less food and spending less time and vigilance - in the patches with the increased risk. This was especially so in the presence of the predator that was expected to most benefit from blocking that particular type of sight line: cover that blocked vertical sight lines was riskiest in the presence of owls, and cover that blocked horizontal sight lines was riskiest in the presence of foxes. These results strongly indicate the importance of sightlines and landscape features such as bushes in the risk management and forging decisions of gerbils, demonstrating that bush cover provides mixed blessing to gerbils by providing cover, but making vigilance ineffective."

This collective vigilance means that a focal individual is usually less susceptible to predation than when alone. However, individuals differ in their vigilance levels depending on status and context. They may also differ in how they adjust their vigilance levels as group size changes. This flexibility in response means that the collective vigilance of a group, and hence its optimal size, is not intuitive. We demonstrate, in both natural and experimental systems, that male and female pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, in harems differentially adjusted their vigilance levels as harem size changed. Females became less vigilant as harems became larger, and benefited by increasing their foraging time. Conversely, males became more vigilant as harems became larger. We calculated the collective probability that a harem would detect a predator. Within natural harem sizes, a male and two females exhibited the highest probability of collective detection, with decreases as more females joined. This optimal harem size matched the average harem size observed at our study site. Females may join harems for benefits of collective vigilance. Despite both sexes having a shared interest in larger harems for mating benefits, optimal harem size is influenced by trade-offs in a nonsexual behaviour, vigilance. This results in males with relatively small harems, females associating with less preferred males and each male being surrounded by fewer females than he could mate with.

We examined whether this group size effect is apparent in mixed-species groups of red-bellied tamarins (S. labiatus) and saddleback tamarins (S. fuscicollis) which form stable and permanent associations in the wild We studied general vigilance and responses to hidden threatening stimuli in five captive groups of each species, while they were housed in single- and mixed-species groups. For vigilance the individual rate was lower in the larger mixed-species groups than in the smaller single-species groups. In addition, the amount of time when at least one individual was vigilant was higher in mixed-species groups. This suggests that the tamarins alter their vigilance behavior in the presence of the other species. In response to hidden threats, both species performed brief vigilance checks and frequencies of checking did not differ in single- and mixed-species groups. However both species had a significant reduction in the mean duration per check and there was a reduced total amount of time spent vigilance checking in the mixed-species groups compared to the single-species groups, demonstrating the group size effect. Overall, the mixed-species groups had a higher number and mean duration of checking than the smaller single-species groups. Given that the two species share a common set of predators, and respond to each other's alarm calls, these findings provide strong evidence that individuals of both tamarin species may be able to benefit from forming mixed-species groups via improved vigilance and monitoring of threats."

As behaviors are time costly, there is a tradeoff between vigilance and feeding behavior. Male vigilance can be regarded as a male investment in their mates and may benefit the female by reducing the danger of predation, increasing her probability of survival, and allowing more time for her to forage to obtain more resources for egg production and incubation. In this study, we documented the proportion of time spent in vigilance and feeding by Chinese grouse Tetrastes sewerzowi with their mates and alone during the pre-incubation period, and then estimated male vigilance under more severe predation pressures through predator call playback. Our results indicated that paired male Chinese grouse spend more time in vigilance than unpaired males and paired females and could alter their activity budgets in response to the social context (i.e. with and without their mate) and an experimental encounter with an important predator. Male vigilance behavior and presence allowed females to spend more time foraging. We therefore conclude that vigilance behavior by their male partners by may play an important role in promoting the females' survival and probably the reproductive success. The proportion of time allocated for vigilance by males and foraging by females of Chinese grouse during the pre-incubation period was the highest recorded among monogamous grouse species, perhaps because the Chinese grouse is the smallest grouse species and has the highest relative reproductive investment."

Vigilance while sleeping decreased with increasing nock size for females but not for males. The pecking rate was reduced at the end of the winter, when Green-winged Teals were facing important energy requirements. Exposure to a predator resulted in maintenance of a high peeking rate.

Through a principal component analysis of seven indices of social interactions, we previously obtained three components of relationship quality, reflecting the levels of compatibility, value, and security. Such components could differentially affect vigilance depending on whether vigilance is directed to extra-group threats or risky group members. We tested whether an individual's vigilance was affected by (1) the mean level of compatibility, the mean level of value and the mean level of security across subgroup members; (2) the lowest level of compatibility, the lowest level of value, and the lowest level of security with any subgroup member; and (3) the mean level of compatibility, the mean level of value, and the mean level of security with neighbors (i.e., subgroup members within 5 m).

Few studies have distinguished between vigilance types when examining the effects of predation risk and, in the absence of a commonly accepted conceptual framework, the variables used to define predation risk vary greatly between studies. We investigated the relative importance of four predation risk categories (risky place assessed at the landscape and habitat level, vegetation characteristics at foraging site level, prey characteristics and resource availability) for the time spent on intense and routine vigilance by Burchell's zebra, Equus quagga burchellii, and blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus taurinus, under predation risk from reintroduced predators, lions, Panthera leo. The risk categories each represented a different predation risk component and included metrics that defined the component at multiple scales. Intense vigilance responses were scale dependent, with zebra responding to a risky place at the landscape level and wildebeest to vegetation characteristics at a foraging area scale. Yet both species were able to adjust and balance time spent on vigilance types. Prey characteristics reduced the intense vigilance of wildebeest as herd size increased. Both species maintained similar levels of intense vigilance between seasons, despite lower resource availability, and thus higher foraging costs, in the dry season. However, the reduction in grass quality probably resulted in the increase in routine vigilance by both species during the dry season, as more time was needed to chew grasses with high fibre content. Our findings suggest different underlying mechanisms for the two types of vigilance behaviour, which were influenced by the ecology of the species, and demonstrate the importance of distinguishing vigilance types in predation risk studies.

Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus (Ord, 1815)) show a group-size effect of reduced individual vigilance in larger groups owing to increased predator detection. Such groups are composed of both kin and nonkin individuals. We observed vigilance (raising head above shoulders while foraging) of yearling males and yearling and older females, and examined kin relationships that are learned in the natal nest (viz., uterine kin). We then tested for possible effects of kinship on vigilance and thus on the group-size effect. Because of the kin-biased behaviours and nepotistic alarm calls shown by ground squirrels in previous studies, we expected either a kin-cooperative influence on vigilance or a nepotistic asymmetrical effect on vigilance,. We found that the presence of kin (whether above ground or not) had little or no effect on vigilance. This lack of kin effect reveals that Columbian ground squirrels do not rely any more on close relatives than on unrelated group members for detecting predators. Thus, the presence of kin does not contribute to the group-size effect on vigilance."

We examined how habitat differences and flock size and composition explain feeding and vigilance rates in common cranes Grus grus, wintering in holm oak Quercus ilex dehesas of Spain. Flock size and composition were related to habitat type in cranes: flocks formed in areas sown with cereal crops were larger than flocks formed in set aside areas. Vigilance rate depended on habitat but decreased with increasing flock size in a similar way across all habitats. Juveniles were less vigilant than adults and showed little change in vigilance with flock size. Vigilance increased and feeding time decreased over months from November through February. Our results show that vigilance is affected by habitat but that the group size effect on vigilance is not the product of differences between habitats in group size or composition."

Adult male white-faced capuchins spent significantly more time vigilant than females did, and much male vigilance appeared to be directed toward males from other social groups. This finding supports the protection of paternity hypothesis. No sex difference existed in vigilance behavior among the ring-railed lemurs, and subjects of both sexes exhibited more vigilance toward predators/potential predators than toward extragroup conspecifics, which supports the predator detection hypothesis. A trade-off argument, suggesting that females tolerate males in a group in return for greater male vigilance, does not apply to ring-tailed lemurs in our study. In both the male-dominant capuchins and the female-dominant ring-tailed lemurs, the alpha subject in the majority of the study groups was significantly more vigilant than other group members were. In white-faced capuchins, the alpha male mates more often than subordinate males do; therefore, the greater degree of vigilance exhibited by the alpha male may correspond to the protection of his reproductive investment. In ring-tailed lemurs, there can be more than one matriline in a group. Thus, the greater amount of vigilance behavior exhibited by the alpha female may be related to protection of her matriline, which could ultimately lead to greater inclusive fitness. Alpha subjects in our study groups exhibited certain behaviors more frequently or exclusively. Accordingly, there may be a constellation of behaviors characteristic of alpha animals."

Here, we analysed remote-camera video records of wild sika deer (Cervus nippon) at salt licks in southern China from March 1, 2006 to November 30, 2008 to investigate how interference competition and predation risk interacted on vigilance behaviour. Scramble competition is negligible at salt licks; therefore, we could focus our interest in interference competition. We used linear mixed model to compare vigilance, licking and aggression behaviours among females with and without fawn as well as males with different group sizes to identify the primary role of vigilance behaviour in sika deer. In total, 168 individuals were recorded and observation time was 2,733.04 min. We found that deer spent much time on vigilance and scanned frequently in spring and winter, and females with fawn spent more time on vigilance than females without fawn, suggesting vigilance for predation risk. Aggression ratio increased first and then decreased, while scan frequency continued to decline and then slightly increased when group size increased from two to seven, implying vigilance for interference competition. Our results suggested vigilance in sika deer was influenced by both predation risk and interference competition, but was mainly driven by predation risk even at sites with intense interference competition. Our results of interference competition shed some light on finding the underlying mechanism of group size effect in wild populations."
"Beauchamp, Guy",Visual obstruction and vigilance: a natural experiment,JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY,46,476,481,10.1111/jav.00612,2015,"Visual obstructions can cause an increase in antipredator vigilance in prey animals by making predator detection more difficult. However, visual obstructions can also skew the perception of group size and inter-individual distances and impair the detection of alarm signals by conspecifics. These changes within the group alone can cause an increase in vigilance. To disentangle the contribution of these various factors to changes in vigilance, I documented vigilance in a gregarious species, the semipalmated sandpiper Calidris pusilla, foraging in a habitat where a naturally-occurring visual barrier partially prevented predator detection without altering the transfer of information about predation risk within the group. I used a matched sampling design to collect vigilance data for birds using adjacent areas with and without the visual barrier. In the visually-obstructed area, sandpipers maintained a higher level of vigilance, occurred farther away from cover and in smaller flocks, and preferentially scanned the area of danger with one eye in particular. All these changes suggest that visual obstruction increased perceived predation risk. I conclude that it is the inability to get a good view of any approaching predator, rather than changes in intra-group communication that caused the increase in vigilance in the visually-obstructed area."

We have previously shown that thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) increase their vigilance when their lateral field of view is obstructed. In this paper, we describe an experiment in which we attempt to determine the predator class for which this vigilance is directed. Using six differentially occluded Plexiglas foraging boxes with hinged 'eaves', we were able to obstruct the squirrels' view of the sky while not obstructing their view of terrestrial threats. In general, across the box types, when their sky view was obstructed, ground squirrels increased their vigilance by increasing the percentage of time spent withdrawn from the boxes. This result suggests that a significant portion of ground squirrel antipredator vigilance is directed at the sky and is surveillance for aerial predators."

Mallard, a swimming bird, forages in irregular and loose circular groups in open water and its foraging mode (with its head underwater looking for food) does not allow for simultaneous monitoring of potential threats above the water surface, which is why its foraging is called blind period of foraging. In contrast, black-winged stilt is a wading bird and forages along riversides in long linear foraging groups. Its long beak, neck and legs enable it to scan around while foraging without any obviously blind period. We used the focal sampling method and measured vigilance behavior by the time spent vigilant, vigilance frequency, average duration of vigilance, alert distance and flee distance for the two species. We predicted higher levels of vigilance and longer alert and flee distance in mallard with long blind periods of foraging. Our results indicated significant differences (p<0.05) in vigilance behavior between the two species. The effects of group size and gender on vigilance were also checked but showed no significant differences. Higher-level vigilance in mallard was mainly due to its foraging mode with long 'blind periods' and circular foraging group pattern. We suggested that buffer zones be established in ecotourism regions in order to protect birds from human interference."

However, few studies have investigated the effect of one group member being vigilant on the probability of others being vigilant in group-forming prey species. Thus, we studied vigilance activity of eastern gray kangaroos Macropus giganteus that still experience occasional predation. We video recorded the behavior of all group members simultaneously and investigated the probability of a focal group member being vigilant (or nonvigilant) in relation to other individuals' vigilant and nonvigilant behaviors. Our results show that the decision of an individual to exhibit a vigilant posture depended on what it and other group members had been doing (scanning or foraging) at the preceding second and on group size. The probability of an individual being vigilant was positively affected by the proportion of companions that were vigilant at the previous second, confirming the existence in this species of a tendency for synchronization of individual vigilance. Group size affected individuals' vigilance in 3 ways. First, individuals were more likely to be vigilant if the proportion of their group mates that was vigilant was high, and this was strengthened with increasing group size. Second, the effect of the individual's own vigilance state (vigilant or not) at the previous second also increased with group size. Third, the probability of an individual being vigilant decreased with group size. These findings increase our understanding of the much-studied relationship between vigilance and group size."

In birds, vigilance is often associated with head-up postures adopted within a bout of head-down activity, and this can be used by conspecifics to assess the vigilance of their flock mates. However, vigilance behaviour is not always obvious and other cues may then be used to assess vigilance rates of conspecifics. Here we assess whether iris/eyelid/face patterns from 43 duck species are consistent with the hypothesis that eyelid brightness has evolved so as to contrast with iris brightness, which may then help in signalling individual vigilance status. Ducks generally flock when resting during the day, and because of their wide visual fields, individuals can monitor their environment while remaining in a resting head-down position. Ducks also show a wide variety of plumage and iris patterns, with both light-headed and dark-headed species. Matching our prediction, most ducks with dark irises had pale eyelids, irrespective of head colour. Furthermore, the smaller number of species with a pale iris generally have darker eyelids. A phylogenetic analysis shows a clear and significant association in the evolution of eyelid and iris brightness patterns in both males and females. These data therefore provide support for the hypothesis that eyelid brightness has evolved to act as a contrast with iris brightness. Further studies are now needed to examine the extent to which and the way this is used in vigilance information transfer between individuals."
"Beauchamp, Guy",The spatial distribution of foragers and food patches can influence antipredator vigilance,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,28,304,311,10.1093/beheco/arw160,2017,"Antipredator vigilance is a major component of defenses against predators for many prey species. For group foragers, such vigilance is predicted by models to decrease with group size reflecting better predator detection ability and risk dilution in larger groups. Influential vigilance models for group foragers have made simplifying and often quite restrictive assumptions. Prey species, for instance, are expected to search for resources in groups of fixed sizes although frequent changes in group sizes often occur while foraging. Groups of prey in the same area are also assumed to be attacked independently, but predators could sequentially target several local groups after a failed attempt. I propose a framework in which prey animals can form groups by joining feeding neighbors and also adjust their vigilance in these groups of varying sizes. Predators can attack one of the many groups that occur in the same area and can also target groups of specific sizes. I used a genetic algorithm approach to simultaneously tackle joining and vigilance choices by prey individuals. I show that joining tendencies and the effect of group size on vigilance can vary with forager population size, the spatial distribution of resources, and predator attack tactics. The modeling framework adopted here generates several novel predictions about vigilance and joining tendencies for group foragers, and highlights the importance of considering the availability and vulnerability of prey groups in the same habitat when predicting antipredator vigilance."

In addition, their vigilance increased in winter, possibly due to hunting by humans."

Here, we investigated individual and collective vigilance in a natural population of greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), a gregarious ruminant living under high predation risk. Controlling for environmental, individual and group factors, we show that the proportion of time during which at least one individual was vigilant increased with group size, whereas individual investment in vigilance decreased. We also show that individuals tended to synchronize both vigilance and feeding activities. More generally, and whatever the considered group size, we demonstrate how the independent scanning assumption underestimated both the proportion of time during which no individual was vigilant and the proportion of time during which all individuals were simultaneously vigilant, but overestimated the proportion of time during which one vigilant individual only was present. Our results thus contrast with the point of view that the alternative to independent vigilance is coordinated vigilance and plead for a better description of the processes whereby reciprocal influences between individuals shape collective patterns of vigilance."

However, in addition to group size, many other social and environmental factors also influence the degree of vigilance, including the season of the year and the sex of the individual. In our study, we examined the vigilant behavior of goitered gazelles in the Xinjiang Province in western China to test whether and how seasons, the yearly breeding cycle, and group size affect vigilance. According to our results, we found that seasonal factors were not a substantial influence on a gazelle's level of vigilance, while group size had a tangible effect. In comparison, the yearly breeding cycle (a natural phenomenon) was the most powerful factor: it significantly changed the degree of vigilance in females during birthing and males during rut. Anthropogenic factors (unnatural phenomena) were also potential causes of increased vigilance in both sexes during winter."

Optimal group size results from the trade off between advantages (a reduction in the risk of predation) and disadvantages (competition between members of the herd) of group living. In addition, advantages and disadvantages of group living may vary depending on the position of each individual within the herd. Our objective was to study the effect of central vs. peripheral position in the herd on feeding and vigilance behavior in male and female Pyrenean chamois and to ascertain if a group size effect existed. We used focal animal sampling and recorded social interactions when a focal animal was involved. With males, vigilance rate was higher in the central part of the group than at the periphery, probably due to a higher density of animals in the central part of the herd and a higher probability of being disturbed by conspecifics. With females, vigilance rate did not differ according to position in the herd. Females spent more time feeding than males, and males showed a higher frequency of the vigilance behavior than females. We did not observe a clear relationship between group size and vigilance behavior. The differences in vigilance behavior might be due to social interactions [Current Zoology 56(2): 232-237, 2010]."

Vigilance was tested through the Mackworth Clock test (MCT; Mackworth, 1948),1 and several vigilance indicators were registered: correct responses (hits), misses, response time (RT) for the hits, false positives, sensitivity, and precision. Correlation analysis showed that Extraversion negatively correlated with hits and precision, while Conscientiousness positively correlated with hits, sensitivity, and precision, and negatively correlated with misses and false positives. Additionally, Honesty-Humility positively correlated with precision, and negatively correlated with false positives.

The rate of vigilance and the time spent vigilant in the Closed Site were higher than in the Open Site, while the mean duration of each vigilance bout did not differ between the two sites.

We first modelled the relationship between food availability and, instantaneous intake rate (i.e. the functional response), and looked at the relationship between the residuals, of this relationship and scan rate and scan duration. Both scan rate and scan duration were negatively correlated with the residuals, but the cost associated with an increase in each component of vigilance differed. The average time spent in vigilance by ducks was 5 sec per minute: 5 scans of 1 sec decreased the. maximum instantaneous intake rate by 2.4% whereas one scan of 5 sec decreased the maximum intake rate by 6%. This shows that. an increase in the duration of scans has a greater effect-than an increase in their frequency and confirms that vigilance not only affects the time spent feeding but also feeding efficiency through instantaneous intake rate. We explored the potential consequences of such costs in the time spent foraging on a daily basis."

In these species, at least part of the foraging process is physically compatible with vigilance. Nevertheless, both vigilance and food handling require cognitive resources, so animals may not be vigilant whenever their head is raised. We tested whether grey squirrels are vigilant when they are handling food items held in their forepaws while in a semiupright posture. If vigilance occurs during handling, we predicted that squirrels finding food in a location with a partially blocked view would change location before handling to improve visibility. Because this test assumes that the benefit of vigilance during handling is greater than the cost of moving, we tested small food items (sunflower seeds) in which the temporal cost of changing position on the rate of food intake was relatively high and large items (crackers with peanut butter) in which the cost of changing position was relatively low. When handling crackers, squirrels that had their lateral view obstructed at the food presentation site changed to a position with a better view more often than controls or squirrels that had their overhead view obstructed. When handling sunflower seeds, squirrels never changed their position. These results support the view that squirrels are vigilant during semiupright handling, but that vigilance may be sacrificed if it leads to high foraging costs.

Each bird was observed for 2 minutes using a 20-60 x 60 telescope. For each focal bird air temperature, windspeed (using an anemometer), distance to the nearest conspecific at the start of monitoring, number of individual godwits and other waders and gulls in a radius of 10 m of the sampled bird and godwit position (central or peripheral) were recorded. Dependent variables recorded were vigilance time, scanning rate and scan duration.Results and Conclusions: Vigilance time and scanning rate were higher in peripheral godwits than in central godwits, while mean scan duration did not differ significantly between both groups. Using as predictors godwit position (central vs peripheral), presence or absence of black-headed gull and air temperature the best model to explain vigilance time (Akaike weight, w(i) = 0.248) and scanning rate (wi = 0.427) included in both cases the godwit position, presence of black-headed gulls and air temperature. Godwit position was a consequential predictor with a negative effect of the central sites in the vigilance time and scanning rate. Black-headed gull presence and air temperature were two consequential predictors that influenced the increase of the vigilance time and scanning rate in roosting godwits. Birds may make postural changes to alter heat loss and we suggest that to increase heat loss the head may be more frequently raised after preening bout. In accordance with this hypothesis, in high temperatures the head rising in preening godwits could have antipredatory and thermoregulatory functions."

Mere presence has been found to reduce vigilance. However, animal research has also shown that chemosignals (e.g., sweat) produced during fear-inducing situations modulate individuals' threat detection strategies. In the case of humans, little is known about how exposure to conspecifics' fear chemosignals modulates vigilance and threat detection effectiveness. This study (N = 59) examined how human fear chemosignals affect vigilance strategies and threat avoidance in its receivers. We relied on a paradigm that simulates a foraging under threat situation in the lab, integrated with an eye-tracker to examine the attention allocation. Our results showed that the exposure to fear chemosignals (vs. rest chemosignals and a no-sweat condition) while not changing vigilance behavior leads to faster answers to threatening events. In conclusion, fear chemosignals seem to constitute an important warning signal for human beings, possibly leading their receiver to a readiness state that allows faster reactions to threat-related events."
"Frid, A",Vigilance by female Dall's sheep: Interactions between predation risk factors,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,53,799,808,10.1006/anbe.1996.0345,1997,"Data on adult female Dall's sheep, Ovis nalli dalli, were used to assess how predation risk factors combine to affect vigilance. An interactive factors hypothesis was proposed, and whether predation risk factors have interactive (or multiplicative) effects on vigilance was tested. Because most studies have implicitly assumed additivity, for illustrative purposes the alternative but less plausible independent factors hypothesis, in which predation risk factors have independent (or additive) effects on vigilance, was also tested. It was predicted that natural selection would favour interactive relationships because, rather than making redundant investments in anti-predator behaviour, animals that are already 'safe enough' can make greater investments in foraging (i.e. an animal in a very large group need not have a strong vigilance response to increasing distance to refuge). Results supported the interactive model and did not support the independent model. Sheep became less vigilant as group size increased, but this relationship became weaker as they got closer to cliffs. Sheep also became more vigilant as distance to cliffs increased, but this relationship became weaker as group size increased. Finally, a posteriori analysis suggested that when sheep were within 20 m from obstructive cover, the interaction between group size and distance to cliffs affected vigilance more strongly than when sheep were further from obstructive cover. Rather than implicitly assuming that predation risk factors have additive effects, as most previous studies have done, generating predictions with the interactive factors hypothesis may be a more realistic approach for understanding vigilance and other anti-predator behaviours.

Social influences on vigilance scans have been overlooked in studies on ungulates, although studies in primates and birds show that conspecific scans are important determinants of vigilance behaviour. We investigated group size effects in giraffes and examined social influences on their scanning. behaviour, as well as the influence of feeding posture. We found that group size has little effect on scanning behaviour in either bulls or cows, which may be attributable to our inability to measure a group as perceived by a giraffe. Time spent scanning by lone cows did not differ from that of cows in any other group type, but time spent scanning by bulls when alone was less than that in groups. The presence of calves in a group did not influence scanning behaviour. Predation risk does not appear to be a significant modifier of vigilance behaviour, although a constant level of antipredator vigilance is probably maintained. Social factors were a significant modifier of vigilance scanning. Bulls scanned the most when they were in groups with larger bulls, and least when they were with smaller bulls. A similar pattern was seen with nearest-neighbour identity, and the identity of individuals within 10 in of a focal animal. Cows were significantly more vigilant when an adult bull was close, or was the nearest neighbour. Finally, vigilance advantages have been postulated as a determinant of sexual segregation in giraffe foraging heights but we found that the posture associated with high foraging heights imposes a vigilance cost, not an advantage. We therefore conclude that differential vigilance requirements are not a determinant of feeding height segregation between giraffe bulls and cows.

In addition to being the first such study of a southern African granivore, this was the first study of a group-forager to differentiate between vigilance for other flock members (conspecifics) and vigilance for predators. We verified a perception of predation risk by placing five feeders at increasing distances from cover. The mean number of birds at a feeder decreased significantly with increasing distance from cover. We manipulated levels of aggression by restricting access to random numbers of feeding holes at various distances. The treatments succeeded in forcing birds to feed further from cover, and by inference, increased levels of aggression. We measured time budgets with focal samples on marked individuals. There was no influence of group size on time budgets. There was a non-significant (p < 0.06) trend for vigilance to increase with increasing distance from cover (predation risk). There was no pattern in the relative vigilance for predators as opposed to vigilance for other hock members (conspecifics), either with group size, distance from cover, or manipulated levels of aggression. Despite our inability to detect patterns of vigilance for other hock members, we emphasize the importance of studies to elucidate such a process."

This scale may be inappropriate to assess the link between habitat structure and vigilance, however, because visually hunting predators often detect prey from several hundred meters away. As a result, large-scale habitat structure could affect both the hunting decisions of predators and antipredator behaviors of prey. Here we investigated the effect of small- and large-scale habitat structure, as well as group composition (kinship) on vigilance allocation of breeders in the Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus. Vigilance had an antipredator function and was increased after exposure to a predator model. Small-scale habitat structure did not affect vigilance rates, however, habitat structure of the whole territory, measured as the proportion of visual cover, affected vigilance depending on group composition. Breeders with retained offspring (kin) in their group were more vigilant in managed open territories than on pristine dense territories, whereas breeders without kin in their groups did not adjust vigilance rates in relation to large-scaled habitat structure. Earlier studies have revealed that hawks, the main predators of jays, primarily kill non-kin group members living in groups inhabiting open territories. Therefore, we suggest that breeders adjusted their vigilance depending on the habitat-specific predation risk to protect their retained offspring. This demonstrates that large-scale habitat structure affects predator-prey interactions and is crucial to understanding spatial variation in antipredator allocation and mortality."

Vigilance and escape are two important aspects of anti-predation behavior and have received considerable attention for decades. However, the relationship between them remains largely unexplored, and our knowledge on the diel patterns of these behaviors is also limited. In the present study, we measured various types of vigilance and escape behavior in Daurian ground squirrel (Spermophilus dauricus), to assess the function of vigilance in promoting detection and escape. We also explored the diel patterns of these anti-predation behaviors using comparisons among three periods within a day (morning, noon and evening). Total duration of vigilance was not closely associated with flight initiation distance, alert distance or buffer distance. However, duration of quadrupedal vigilance was negatively related to flight initiation distance, while positively related to alert distance and buffer distance. Alert distance was also negatively associated with duration of standing scan. These suggested that more vigilant individuals did not flee sooner as usually expected, and highlighted the necessity of separately considering the anti-predation function of various components of vigilance. A significant diel pattern was detected, with ground squirrels spending more time on energetically expensive vigilance (standing scan) and fleeing sooner (with longer flight initiation distance) at noon. Such a temporal pattern was more likely to be driven by the temporal changes in energetic status and balance between energy intake and safety thereof, rather than temporal changes in predation risk, competitors or detection ability. Significance statement Although vigilance and escape behavior have been frequently studied for decades, their relationship is rarely explored and it remains unclear whether a more vigilant individual would also flee sooner. In this study, we explored the relationship between individual vigilance level and flight initiation distance in a ground squirrel. We found that duration of quadrupedal vigilance, rather than total duration of vigilance, is significantly related to flight initiation distance. Contrary to expectations, individuals spending more time on quadrupedal vigilance tended to flee later, although they generally detected predators earlier. We also found that compared to the morning and evening, squirrels were more vigilant and fled sooner at noon, possibly due the temporal change in individual energetic status. Our results suggest that the anti-predation function of vigilance deserves reconsideration, and emphasize the importance of splitting vigilance into multiple components."
"Griesser, M",Nepotistic vigilance behavior in Siberian jay parents,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,14,246,250,10.1093/beheco/14.2.246,2003,"Many Siberian jay offspring (up to 50%) postpone independence and stay with their parents for up to 3 years. Parents offer such nondispersers a benefit in that they increase their vigilance while feeding together with retained offspring. In contrast, parents reduce their vigilance while in company of nonrelated flock members according to the many eyes principle. The preferential treatment offered by the parents provides an incentive for offspring to forego dispersal. Given evidence for mortality via surprise attacks by predators (goshawks), such nepotistic vigilance by parents could have a bearing on offspring survival and thereby promote delayed dispersal."

We experimentally manipulated predation risk in a system with a known relationship between group size and vigilance levels to explore whether this relationship changes in response to elevated predation risk. We investigated the vigilance levels of Egyptian geese Alopochen aegyptiaca at eight golf courses in the western Cape, South Africa, to assess the perception of and reaction to predation risk. We manipulated predation risk by introducing trained Harris's hawks Parabuteo unicintus where avian predation was otherwise low or absent. The study confirmed the typical reduction in vigilance with group size on control sites, where the risk of predation is low. However, at experimental sites with elevated predation risk, a positive relationship between vigilance and group size was observed. We hypothesize that the mechanism for this relationship might be linked to social information transfer via copying behaviour and manipulation to induce vigilance. Thus, larger groups will have a higher probability of containing individuals with experience of elevated predation risk and their increased vigilance behaviour is copied by naive individuals. This prediction is based on the intended outcome of introducing avian predation to make the geese feel less safe and to eventually leave the site as a management tool for controlling nuisance geese."

During diurnal low-tide periods, feeding was the predominant activity (80-85% of birds sampled). No significant negative relationship was observed between conspecific density and vigilance variables, and this may be related to the increases observed with group size in the intraspecific aggression and probe rates. The godwits showed greater vigilance in the presence of Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus), possibly because of the kleptoparasitic activity of this species. The godwits ingested more worms during the period around low tide and fewer prey items when the air temperature was rising. The feeding rate did not decrease with the conspecific density."

Studies have shown that several social factors (e.g. familiarity, dominance, the mother-offspring relationship) affect behavioural contagion. However, as previous research has focused mostly on play signals and yawning, it is unclear whether such social biases apply to all types of contagious behaviour. Using data from a group of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, we investigated the social biases associated with the contagion of vigilance. Our findings revealed that vigilance exhibited by a given individual was more contagious to lower-ranked than to higher-ranked individuals. In addition, vigilance was more contagious to mothers from their offspring than vice versa. Thus, the susceptibility to vigilance exhibited by others varies according to the social status of each individual and the relationship between each pair of individuals. By contrast, we did not find any effects of kinship on vigilance contagion. This implies that familiarity bias, which is often reported to be associated with the contagion of yawning and play signals, does not influence vigilance contagion. Overall, our findings indicate that behavioural contagion does not occur with equal likelihood but is affected by the interplay between the type of behaviour and social structures.

We measured vigilance and fright and flight response during summer 2006 in the Svalbard archipelago; in four areas on Nordenskiold Land on the island Spitzbergen and in one area on the island Edgeoya. Vigilance was higher in reindeer on Edgeoya than in the four Spitzbergen areas. Males were less vigilant than lactating and barren females and vigilance decreased with increasing group size. The relaxed vigilance behaviour in Svalbard reindeer compared with wild reindeer in southern Norway demonstrates a vigilance threshold in the absence of traditional predators of Rangifer Hamilton Smith, 1827. Alert, flight initiation, and escape distances were all shorter in Adventdalen, with Longyearbyen and its considerably higher amounts of human activities and infrastructure than in the other study areas, supporting evidence of habituation towards humans. There were no systematic vigilance or differences in fright and flight responses between reindeer in Colesdalen, Reindalen, and Sassendalen, indicating that a combination of low level of human activities including hunting, recreation, and scientific activities affected the animals differently. Lower probability of assessing before fleeing in Edgeoya (63% vs. 94% in the Nordenskiold Land areas), along with their higher vigilance, may indicate more frequent interactions with polar bears (Ursus maritimus Phipps, 1774) in Edgeoya."

Classical theories implicitly assume that animals alternate between high and low vigilance states over short timescales, but that average effort invested in vigilance is constant over an extended bout of such alternations. However, one recent model suggests that vigilance should be adjusted dynamically to short-term changes in the perception of predation risk and would tend to decrease with time. Indeed, as time passes by without disturbances, perception of the need for vigilance should decrease and prey animals may allocate more time to competing activities. Here, we examined how the proportion of sleeping gulls (Larus spp.) in loafing groups changed over time. Sleeping gulls can only maintain low levels of vigilance against external threats (compared to alert individuals), and we predicted that the proportion of sleeping gulls at loafing sites should increase over time when no disturbances occur. Statistically significant changes in the proportion of sleeping gulls as a function of time occurred in the majority of sequences and an increase was observed significantly more often than predicted by chance alone. This temporal pattern cannot be caused by reduction in hunger levels because gulls are not feeding at loafing sites. The results indicate that vigilance can be adjusted dynamically in response to short-term temporal changes in the perception of predation risk."

During mid-winter, birds in sleeping posture showed the highest level of vigilance, with longer peeks and shorter interpeek intervals. There was no effect of sex on the intensity of vigilant sleep, nor on changes in the pattern of vigilant sleep across the winter period. We discuss the results in relation to the behavioral ecology and energetic constraints of wintering Gadwalls in the Camargue. We suggest that the variation in sleep, measured by eye-closure, and vigilance, measured by eye-opening, in relation to winter period is a result of a trade-off between two opposite requirements: to save energy by sleeping and to monitor the environment by being vigilant."

We combined behavioural data on individual vigilance of herbivores at waterholes with fine-scale spatiotemporal data from 27 African lions, Panthera leo, fitted with GPS radiocollars to test whether individual prey vigilance increases when predators are in the vicinity and whether this relationship is influenced by group size and presence of other herbivores. The study was conducted on giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, and plains zebra, Equus quagga, in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, between mid-September and mid-November 2008. Kudu was the only species to adjust its vigilance level significantly in the presence of lions, arguably owing to its higher contribution to lion diet in Hwange. Kudu devoted a significantly higher proportion of time to vigilance when lions were in the vicinity. Furthermore, the proportion of time spent on individual vigilance decreased as group size increased during the approach and drinking phases, particularly when lions were in the vicinity. Finally, the presence of other herbivores at the waterhole enabled kudu to spend less time vigilant while drinking. These adjustments involved changes in the length of vigilance bouts, but not in their frequency. Our study suggests that the interplay between the context (group size, presence of other prey) and the immediate presence of predators determines the level of vigilance in prey.

We used a combination of observations and an experiment to examine how vegetation height and peripheral obstructions influence vigilance by foraging yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). First, we analyzed a large sample of observations of marmots foraging in nature. Marmots increased vigilance with vegetation height and reared on their hind legs when in tall vegetation. Second, we observed that marmots foraged in locations with lower vegetation than randomly selected sites in the same meadow. These observations suggest that marmots account for what they can see while foraging but do not rule out the influence of other factors correlated with vegetation height. Therefore, we experimentally blocked the view for 3 sides for marmots feeding on a controlled food source. When the apparatus blocked their vigilance, marmots were less vigilant when foraging, often moved outside the apparatus, and showed heightened vigilance while outside the apparatus. Peripheral obstructions explained more of the variance in our experimental than in our observational results. Together, our results demonstrate that marmots employ antipredator behavior to compensate for peripheral obstructions. Long-term studies show that marmots go locally extinct more often in areas with more obstructions to vigilance. Thus, marmots likely face greater predation risk in those areas, despite the behavioral responses documented in this study."

We model predator-prey interactions in which prey adjust vigilance behavior to mitigate risk of predation and predators their derring-do to manage risk of injury from capturing prey. High derring-do increases a predator's likelihood of capturing prey, but at higher risk of injury to itself. For fixed predator derring-do, prey increase vigilance in response to predator abundance, predator lethality, and predator encounter probability with prey and decrease vigilance with their own feeding rate; there is a humped-shaped relationship between prey vigilance and effectiveness of vigilance. For fixed prey vigilance, predators increase derring-do with the abundance of prey and predator lethality and decrease it with benefit of vigilance to prey and level of prey vigilance. When both prey and predator are behaviorally flexible, a predator-prey foraging game ensues whose solution represents an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). At the ESS, prey provide themselves with a public good as their vigilance causes predators to decrease derring-do. Conversely, predators have negative indirect effects on themselves as their derring-do causes prey to be more vigilant. These behavioral feedbacks create negative intra-specific interaction coefficients. Increasing the population size of prey (or predators) now has a direct negative effect on the prey (or predators). Both effects help stabilize predator-prey dynamics. Besides highlighting a common way by which predators may experience a food-safety tradeoff via dangerous prey, the model suggests why natural selection favors even small defensive measures by prey and hulky predators."

We systematically reviewed the literature on mammalian group-size effects, estimated the effect sizes in each study, and conducted a phylogenetic meta-analysis. We obtained 296 effect sizes from 97 species belonging to 10 Orders and 26 Families. Overall, effect sizes indicated a moderate negative effect of group size (r = -0.44), but 43% of the effect sizes were compatible with a null effect of group size. There was significant heterogeneity in effect sizes. Weaker effect sizes occurred when vigilance was measured as a frequency or a duration rather than as a percentage of time spent vigilant, when measured in closed habitats, during the reproductive season, and in mixed-sex groups or during times when juveniles were absent. We infer a file drawer problem because there were relatively few studies with smaller sample sizes reporting small group-size effects. The results confirm the importance of group size in explaining variation in mammalian vigilance but also suggest which a substantial amount of variation remains unexplained. We suggest that future studies should aim to study mammalian group-size effects by quantifying the percentage of time allocated to vigilance rather than lower-power methods such as frequency or duration of vigilance."

As vigilance and other activities are often mutually exclusive, such behaviours are at the expense of feeding, sleeping or preening. Authors of many wildlife disturbance studies found that people with free-running dogs provoked the most pronounced disturbances (e.g. greater flushing distances and more birds affected). However, dogs on leash may also negatively affect wild animals, and barking dogs may lead to an increase in vigilance. In this study, I tested this hypothesis in coots (Fulica atra) using three different playback procedures: (1) dog barks, (2) conspecific coot alarm calls and (3) chaffinch song. The trials were conducted in spring and autumn 2005 at three study sites in southwestern Germany. During the dog playbacks, vigilance increased significantly from 17 to 28%. This increase in vigilance is comparable to the presence of a natural predator. As expected, vigilance also increased significantly during conspecific coot alarm calls but not during playbacks of the chaffinch song control. Two main findings result from the study: (1) coots respond to acoustic traits of dogs and may be able to acoustically recognise this predator and (2) this increase in vigilance might have implications for conservation, especially when considering buffer zones around sensitive areas."

The main functions attributed to this behaviour are: detection of predators, observation of group members, location of food and avoidance of kleptoparasitism. Principal results obtained in mammals are consistent in showing that individual vigilance decreases and collective vigilance increases with increasing group size, that peripheral individuals are more vigilant than central ones and that males scan more than females during rutting period. This latter difference disappears after parturition. However, inconsistent or contradictory results concerning the influence of age, social rank, habitat and proximity of refuge do not allow determination of obvious relationships.Concurrently to those field studies, modelling the vigilance behaviour consists in estimating individual survival probability which would depend directly on the tradeoff between foraging and vigilance behaviour. However, inaccurate assumptions in the published models do not allow to consider the interspecific and intraspecific variability nor to make precise quantitative predictions. These models also raise the problem of the choice of a time scale to calculate an optimum in decision making."

However, data on scanning in redtail and red colobus monkeys indicate that only one class of individuals in each species derives clear benefits from shared vigilance. Moreover, the expected negative relationship between individual scanning and social group size was not met in these monkeys. Nor was time spent scanning influenced by the sex or species composition of groups. Shared vigilance was observed only among red colobus adult males and redtail adult females and only when they had neighbors within 2 m. Red colobus adult males saved 10% of their scanning time when they had one neighbor within 2 m, while redtail adult females saved 16% of their time under the same conditions No other age-sex class demonstrated a significant decrease.The role of neat neighbors has been underemphasized in previous work on grouping and vigilance, an oversight made more serious because of the often confounded relationship between spatial cohesion and group size. In redtails, but not in red colobus, the number of neighbors within 2 m was significantly positively correlated with group size. This prompts the hypothesis that the inconsistency and poor explanatory power of group size in studies of vigilance may be due to the underlying and undetected role of near neighbors. The paramount role of overall group size in optimality models is therefore questioned."

Mere presence has been found to reduce vigilance. However, animal research has also shown that chemosignals (e.g., sweat) produced during fear-inducing situations modulate individuals' threat detection strategies. In the case of humans, little is known about how exposure to conspecifics' fear chemosignals modulates vigilance and threat detection effectiveness. This study (N = 59) examined how human fear chemosignals affect vigilance strategies and threat avoidance in its receivers. We relied on a paradigm that simulates a foraging under threat situation in the lab, integrated with an eye-tracker to examine the attention allocation. Our results showed that the exposure to fear chemosignals (vs. rest chemosignals and a no-sweat condition) while not changing vigilance behavior leads to faster answers to threatening events. In conclusion, fear chemosignals seem to constitute an important warning signal for human beings, possibly leading their receiver to a readiness state that allows faster reactions to threat-related events."

Using an infra-red video-surveillance system, we show that badgers emerge later from their dens in a population that has been repeatedly subjected to lethal control by humans as compared to badgers from a nearby, undisturbed population. We further illustrate that, despite the apparent lack of a visual or vocal alarm signal to alert group members to a threat, corporate vigilance increases and individual vigilance levels decrease as badgers aggregate in groups (up to 4). These results highlight the possibility that the role of (human) predation in badger social evolution has not been sufficiently considered."

On average, individuals showed a higher proportion of time invested in vigilance and a lower proportion of time invested in foraging than a previously studied guanaco population belonging to the same ecological region as the source population, suggesting that at the time of this study, the reintroduced population was not fully adapted to the new habitat or suffered from an increased predation pressure. On the other hand, as expected for the species, throughout the study period, males allocated more time to vigilance than females, both sexes increasing vigilance during the reproductive period, and females increasing foraging time allocation during the post-reproductive period.

Development of anti-predator behaviour may be impaired in captive conditions which favour low emotional reactivity, resulting in poor perception of danger. Therefore, the newly reintroduced, naive animals may not behave adaptively in terms of anti-predator vigilance, resulting in increased vulnerability to predators. Such behavioural deficiencies may have contributed to the low success rates of reintroductions, but few studies have measured post-release vigilance in captive-bred animals, and none has been published on reintroduced grey partridges. Therefore, in this study we investigated post-release vigilance behaviour and time budgets in coveys of captive-bred grey partridges (Perdix perdix: N = 26) released in autumn over two years. We observed the captive-bred grey partridge coveys in the field, and recorded their group vigilance rates as well as time budgets of individual behaviour, including vigilance and feeding. Released grey partridges had low group vigilance rates and showed poor individual vigilance (4-5% of time spent vigilant) compared to their wild counterparts (43% of time spent vigilant; Watson et al., 2007). Moreover, released individuals spent 30-48% of their time feeding, and fed at this rate throughout the day, instead of concentrating their feeding around dawn and dusk like wild grey partridges do. The revealed vigilance and feeding behaviour in released grey partridges are likely to increase vulnerability to predators, and therefore offer plausible explanations for the high predation rates of released grey partridges observed with these and previous releases. Rearing methods should be developed to encourage wariness in the captive animals. In addition, the adaptive bimodal feeding routine of wild grey partridges should be encouraged in the captive-bred birds, for example by feeding them only at dawn and dusk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Such foraging costs of vigilance have been predicted to have profound effects on the structure of communities. Recently, however, it has been argued that mammalian herbivores might be capable of maintaining their rate of food intake despite being vigilant, because of their ability to scan the environment while chewing vegetation. We conducted behavioral observations to evaluate whether vigilance decreases the bite rate of free-ranging female bison (Bison bison) in Prince Albert National Park and elk (Cervus canadensis) in Yellowstone National Park. Modeling of foraging processes indicated that chewing time exceeded the time that bison and elk spent searching for food, interacting with conspecifics, and scanning. Consequently, bison and elk might have been capable of maintaining their rate of food intake despite vigilance. The maintenance of intake rate would have required bison and elk to match scanning events closely with chewing bouts, but we did not detect a positive correlation between the duration of scanning bouts and the number of consecutive bites taken just before vigilance events. As a result, vigilance was costly, and as it increased, bite rate declined for both herbivore species. Scanning still overlapped partially with food handling. Indeed, we estimated that 31% of feeding time being vigilant decreased bite rate by 20% for bison and 26% for elk, whereas total absence of overlap between chewing and scanning should have reduced bite rate by 31%. While we observed that vigilance induced foraging costs, these costs were less important than traditionally assumed."

Assessment of all forms of social vigilance behavior indicates that it comprises: (1) early warning given by a straying, restless, independent animal who is temporarily spatially remote from the main body (incidental vigilance), (2) consistent watchfulness by large males, who may derive cues from the incidental animals, and who may dominate and direct group behaviour in a situation perceived as threatening (dominant vigilance), (3) miscellaneous barking by several animals, including young and females (unidifferentiated vigilance). Studies of lek birds, ungulates and a few species of monkey, provide some parallels in the vigilance of fringe animals as well as of dominant animals. Present results indicate significant forms of social vigilance in baboons that are a by-product of the particular form of dominance-hierarchy and sexual-social relationships within the group. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: G.

This pattern might be explained by collective detection (increased probability of observing a predator) or risk dilution (decreased likelihood of being captured with larger group size). If dilution is the main cause of the group-size effect, nearest-neighbour distances and distance to the edge of the group would affect vigilance, and alarm calling and factors that affect hearing alarm calls would not affect vigilance. The opposite outcomes are expected if detection is the primary influence. We used both model fitting and hypothesis testing to determine which mechanism had the greater effect, using 14 populations of Columbian ground squirrels, Spermophihis columbianus. Vigilance decreased significantly with increases in group size (R-2 = 0.70, P = 0.0002). Model fitting revealed that the detection model was a statistically good fit to our data and the dilution model was not. We found no significant effect of nearest-neighbour distance on the proportion of time vigilant. Distance of individuals to the edge of the meadow habitat had a marginally significant effect on vigilance in one analysis, but no significant effect in three other analyses. Alarm calls occurred in 56.1% of observations and had a significant effect on vigilance. Wind speed did not show a significant effect on proportion of time vigilant during foraging bouts (mixed models: F = 2.41, P = 0.12), but squirrels were observed to forage less in high wind. All of these results support the detection hypothesis. Group type and means of information transfer about predators may be indicators of which mechanism, detection or dilution, has the greatest influence on the group-size effect on vigilance.

"Carter, K; Goldizen, AW",Habitat choice and vigilance behaviour of brush-tailed rock-wallabies (Petrogale penicillata) within their nocturnal foraging ranges,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,30,355,364,10.1071/WR02095,2003,"Habitat choice by brush-tailed rock-wallabies (Petrogale penicillata) in south-east Queensland was investigated by comparing the attributes of the nocturnal foraging locations that they selected with those of random locations within a radius of 50 m. Brush-tailed rock-wallabies were shown to select foraging locations on the basis of forage quality and/or their ability to see predators, rather than protection from predators amongst vegetation that could conceal them. Habitat choice may have been affected by limited food availability, as this study was conducted in the winter dry season. The attributes of foraging locations that brush- tailed rock-wallabies perceived as increasing their predation risk were assessed by recording the proportion of time that brush- tailed rock-wallabies spent vigilant while foraging. To measure vigilance, focal animals were observed with a night- vision scope for two minutes and the proportions of time spent vigilant and feeding were recorded. No measured feature of foraging locations was related to higher vigilance levels, suggesting that brush- tailed rock-wallabies did not alter their vigilance whether sheltered amongst grass tussocks or in open habitat, or whether feeding on good quality or poorer quality vegetation. Vigilance levels significantly declined as overnight temperatures decreased, which may have resulted from higher energy requirements of brush- tailed rock-wallabies during winter. The only factors that were found to significantly increase vigilance levels were high winds and moonlit nights. On bright nights, brush- tailed rock-wallabies were very unsettled and during high winds they often did not emerge to feed. More information is needed about how macropods detect predators at night before the effects of wind and light intensity upon vigilance can be fully understood."

Rates were generally low. They decreased as group size increased but were not lower when other grazers joined springbok herds. Edge animals spent roughly twice as much time vigilant as central animals. Juveniles were slightly less vigilant than adults but this may reflect greater movement. Surprisingly, springbok were more vigilant in late mornings than in early mornings or afternoons. Spring bok approaching tree clumps were more vigilant than matched individuals moving in the open. Preliminary data indicate that vigilance is higher at night than during the day and that territorial males have moderate to low levels of vigilance. In general, vigilance varied in ways expected to lower the risk of being taken by ambush predators such as leopards."

Vigilance and Its Drivers in a Predator-free World,ETHOLOGY,121,651,660,10.1111/eth.12377,2015,"Vigilance is a key to the early detection of predators, but may be costly if it impairs foraging efficiency. Hence, we would expect vigilance to be suppressed and/or counter-selected in predator-free environments, although this might depend on the environmental drivers influencing perceived predation risk. We studied vigilance in two populations of Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) on Haida Gwaii (Canada) which have not been exposed to predators since they colonized the study islands approx. 60yr ago. In this context, anti-predator behavior should not have any obvious current benefit. Moreover, its maintenance should be particularly costly in our study populations because these deer have depleted their food resources and, thus, anti-predator behaviors should interfere with time spent searching for scarce resources. We used bait stations equipped with camera traps to assess vigilance under standardized feeding conditions. We expected to observe lower vigilance levels than those observed elsewhere in locations with predators. We investigated how vigilance varied in relation to the amount of bait, the level of visibility, and between day and night. During the day, deer spent, on average, 14% of their time in overt vigilance during foraging bouts, a level similar to, although in the lower range of, values reported at sites where predators are present. Levels of vigilance were lower at night, and decreased with increasing visibility, but not during the day. Deer were less vigilant when bait availability was high, but only when visibility was also high. We discuss why the maintenance of vigilance is here best explained by the ghosts of predators past, and how, at the temporal scale of a few generations, the ecological factors driving vigilance levels might override the absence of significant risk from large predators."

Detailed data on the time-budget were collected through focal animal observation technique to determine whether the time budget activities of Bohor reedbuck was affected by vegetation cover and to test if herd size, position in herd, the age and sex affect vigilance efficiency. We fit generalized linear mixed-effect models to assess how herd size, sex, animal position in the herd and age affected individual time allocation to vigilance behaviour. The most parsimonious model averaging clearly showed how vigilance behaviour among Bohor reedbuck was strongly affected by age, sex, the total herd size and animal position in the herd accounting for the lowest Delta value of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Vigilance and feeding behaviour occupied the largest percent of Bohor reedbuck daylight time budget. Herd size effects were significant on different behaviour categories only when the Bohor reedbuck was observed in sympatric association. Our findings support the herd size effect hypothesis only in sympatric grouping system. However, further study is needed to investigate the possible sex-specific functions and targets of vigilance behaviour with respect to the herd direction in the field."

With increasing group size, individuals commonly reduce vigilance. This group size effect can arise from both dilution of risk and increased collective detection. To determine which was more important, we compared vigilance levels of plains zebra, Equus quagga, in areas inhabited by their main predator, lion, Panthera leo, as a function of herd size and composition (zebra-only versus mixed-species herds). For zebra-only herds, vigilance declined with increasing zebra numbers. In contrast, in mixed-species herds, zebra vigilance levels were significantly lower and did not vary with the total number of ungulates and/or zebra in the herd. This lower vigilance can be explained by detection benefits, since we controlled for the influence of herd size (i.e. dilution) statistically. Furthermore, we found that zebra in smaller herds were half as vigilant when they co-occurred with another preferred prey of lion, blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, compared with zebra-only herds. However, when zebra foraged with impala, Aepyceros melampus, a nonpreferred prey, there was only a slight reduction in vigilance compared with similar-sized zebra-only herds. Interestingly, the decrease in zebra vigilance when herding with wildebeest was influenced by the presence/absence, but not number, of wildebeest. In contrast, impala only reduced zebra vigilance when they comprised about 75% of the herd. Ultimately, our results indicate that for zebra in mixed-species herds, detection benefits are relatively more important than dilution over a larger range of herd sizes. However, detection only reduces vigilance when zebras herd with species that share a common predator (i.e. diluting partner). Potentially, detection by species that do not share a common predator (i.e. low-diluting partner) is not as reliable as detection by diluting species.

L.; Hill, Russell A.",Definition and interpretation effects: how different vigilance definitions can produce varied results,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,180,197,208,10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.08.019,2021,"Animals use vigilance to detect or monitor threats. While numerous aspects of vigilance have been studied across a wide range of species, little work has explored the methodological variation that has emerged across these studies. Different approaches in sampling designs, statistical analyses and definitions can make cross-study comparisons challenging and potentially obscure our understanding of animal vigilance. In this study we explore two important components of vigilance definitions and ask (1) whether definitions vary in their interobserver agreement, and (2) whether using different definitions can create varied results within and across observers. Separate groups of 'experienced' and 'inexperienced' observers extracted data from video focal observations of wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, using four different definitions representative of the variation found within primate vigilance literature. In the first stage of analysis, we found that the four definitions varied in their interobserver agreement, with only an operational-looking definition performing well across both duration and frequency assessments, and an experienced/inexperienced dichotomy. This suggests definitions vary in how well observers can converge on similar interpretations of the same definition. The second part of the analysis used the experienced group's data in a typical primate vigilance analysis and found results varied within observers across definitions, i.e. definition effects, and across observers within definitions, i.e. interpretation effects. Together these results suggest that variation in definitions and their interpretation could have a fundamental role in producing between-study differences in results. Future vigilance research must consider these factors and explore working towards a single framework for studying vigilance, particularly within taxonomic families. Without consistency, cross-study comparisons are likely to be challenging and future observational work on other behaviours may also benefit from exploring these types of definitional issues. For baboons, operationalized definitions appear the most consistent across observers; however, future research should explore its application in other taxa.

"Domenech, J; Senar, JC",Are foraging Serin Serinus serinus females more vigilant than males?: The effect of sex ratio,ARDEA,87,277,284,,1999,"Given that in many bird species females are subordinate to males and that, in general, subordinate individuals are more vigilant than dominants ones, we should predict foraging females to be more vigilant than males. This prediction is tested here in flocks of Serins Serinus serinus, where several males may forage together. Pile compared 41 winter foraging pairs (male versus female). Results showed that male Serins were dominant over females. Proportion of males around the focal pair had a significant effect on vigilance frequency and time spent vigilant and foraging in males, but not in females. When the percentage of males around the focal pair was lower than 50%, females displayed higher vigilance and less foraging time than males; when the percentage of males increased, males and females displayed a similar vigilance pattern. We suggest therefore that in flocks with several males (i.e. high ranking individuals) foraging together, males as well as females should keep the other flock companions as well as predators under surveillance, so that in the end the difference in vigilance rate of males and females would be diluted."

In contrast, sleep is unique behavioural state with widely hypothesized restorative and energy-saving functions, but reducing attentiveness and increasing susceptibility to predation. Sleeping birds resolve this conflict by interrupting sleep with short periods of eye opening (termed 'scans') during vigilant sleep. Miscellaneous environmental factors and sleeping postures may affect the perception of risk and corresponding vigilance level. Here, we investigated the influence of nest vegetation concealment, time of day and sleeping postures on the sleep/vigilance trade-off in incubating Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). We found that incubating females increased their vigilance with increasing nest vegetation cover facing the vigilant eye during both the day and the night periods; however, mean nest vegetation concealment did not affect female vigilance. Females also reduced their total vigilance along with scan frequency during the night period, while displaying the opposite pattern during the daylight. The rest-sleeping position was preferred more during the night compared with the daylight period, and females were more vigilant in this position at night. Our data show that the nest vegetation concealment regardless of visual abilities during different light conditions, time of day and sleeping posture play an underlying role in antipredator vigilance during sleep in this cryptic ground-nesting bird."

Studies show that this trade-off is modulated by the perception of predation risk faced by individuals. Anthropogenic noise can disturb acoustic communication by masking both direct predator detection and the perception of conspecific alarm calls. We would expect a decrease in acoustic awareness to be compensated for by an increase in visual awareness. Thus, we tested whether increases in noise produced by commercial aircraft reduced foraging effort and increased vigilance time in great tits. We videotaped birds feeding on peanut feeders in the vicinity of Barajas airport (Madrid, Spain), and measured behavioural sequences before, during and after aircraft sound events. Our results show that, when aircraft noise peaked, the proportion of time devoted to vigilance was maximal, while that devoted to feeding was minimal. As a result, the ratio between vigilance and foraging was at its maximum when aircraft noise was loudest, being almost double that during baseline levels. The duration of vigilance episodes was strongly correlated with noise levels. Also, the duration of feeding bouts was at its lowest during the peak of noise, and increased after this period. We suggest that these behavioural modifications help foragers visually detect possible predators in those situations in which high levels of noise hamper sound perception. Our study suggests that behavioural plasticity could contribute to the resilience of avian populations exposed to anthropogenic disturbance.

These models combined up to 9 predictor variables of 3 types: characteristics of the prey group (herd size and composition), characteristics of the predator (wolf pack size, distance away, and the presence/absence of a kill), and characteristics of the local environment (distance to woodland edges, snow depth, and snow cover). The set of models spanned a range of complexity from simple univariate models to complex combinations with up to 3 variables of each type. Complex models incorporating the characteristics of the wolf pack, the structure of the elk herd, and the environmental conditions had higher information content than simple models. Although univariate models of vigilance detect significant relationships, they have low information content relative to multivariate models. These results show that elk assesses factors of several types when assessing risk and deciding how much time to allocate to vigilance. In particular, we found that all well-supported models of vigilance included several prey variables and several predator variables. This result highlights the need to consider information about predators when trying to explain variation in vigilance levels in prey."

The habitat is characterized (i) vigilance is by a high rate of human disturbance and by artificial feeding. The following hypotheses were tested: increased due to disturbances on many occasions, (ii) vigilance should follow general patterns found in natural populations, e.g., the many-eyes hypothesis and (iii) vigilance may or may not differ between hybrids and trite Swan Geese. Time spent vigilant during a 2-minute-bout of grazing averaged 15.5 s, which made tip 13% of the nine budget. This amount is not high compared to studies of other geese species in natural environments. There was no (difference between Swan Geese and their hybrids in the duration. Vigilance was not dependent upon the number of birds present as predicted by the many-eyes hypothesis, and did not depend on the distance to water line nor position of the bird (center versus edge of the flock). Therefore, vigilance may serve other functions such as stealing food from others, detecting human passers-by with food or avoid interference between conspecifics."

If we assume that foraging rate ( that is, the number of foraging attempts per minute) decreases as a function of time spent vigilant, an individual can directly increase food intake by reducing time spent vigilant. Alternatively, it may increase food intake by increasing foraging effort, that is, making more foraging attempts in the time remaining after time devoted to anti-predator vigilance is excluded. I studied the foraging behaviour of the Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis) to determine foraging behaviour under different conditions of human disturbance (indirect predation risk), time of day and group size. The results showed that Mynas generally increased their food intake by increasing foraging effort, rather than decreasing vigilance behaviour. Although joining a group resulted in significantly lower levels of vigilance behaviour, it did not increase foraging rate or food intake. Despite being well adapted to the human environment, and having few natural predators, Mynas showed high levels of anti-predator vigilance, at least within the resource rich urban environment. These results are discussed in the light of possible management options to control this highly invasive bird."

Parents face particularly high stakes as they must protect highly vulnerable offspring while also meeting elevated energetic demands. To optimize this trade-off, the risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey should adjust their antipredator behaviour to reflect temporal fluctuations in risk. That is, they should invest more in antipredator behaviour when risk is high and prioritize other activities when risk is low. Here we investigate whether changes in risk level resulting from periodic fawn exposure drive maternal vigilance patterns in Thomson's gazelle, Eudorcas thomsonn. We find that maternal vigilance patterns match the predictions of the risk allocation hypothesis. Mothers are highly vigilant prior to fawn retrieval, when risk of fawn detection by predators is high. They exhibit low levels of vigilance after fawns resume hiding, when certainty of predator absence is high and, therefore, risk is low. We suggest that fawn active periods may function secondarily as a form of predator sampling and that mothers may adjust their vigilance levels in response to information yielded by this sampling.

This effect requires that group members display plastic behavioral responses both in terms of vigilance and foraging to obtain the security benefit from grouping and/or to cope with feeding competition. Most studies on group size effects have reported mean group changes in behavior. However, individuals' adjustment of behavior and thus their individual contribution to the overall group-level plasticity remain unexplored. Using wild-caught nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata), small estrildid finches known to exhibit the group size effect, we investigated individual differences in baseline levels and in plasticity of vigilance and feeding behavior. We experimentally manipulated the number of companions foraging with focal birds and noted how they individually adjusted their vigilance and foraging behavior when group size varied. We found that individuals differed consistently in their vigilance level and foraging rate but not in their ability to adjust to experimental variation in group size. Effect sizes for individual consistency in behavior were as large as those for group-level plasticity. Our results reveal high, albeit not maximal, levels of plasticity in both vigilance and feeding behavior for all individuals in this social foraging context."

As a result, it is expected that peripheral individuals display higher vigilance levels. However, the role of conspecifics in this edge effect may have been previously overlooked, and taking into account the possible role of within-group competition is needed. Vigilance behavior in relation to within-group spatial position was studied in impalas (Aepyceros melampus) feeding on standardized patches. We also controlled for food distribution in order to accurately define a central as opposed to a peripheral position. Our data clearly supported an edge effect, with peripheral individuals spending more time vigilant than their central conspecifics. Data on social interactions suggest that it was easier for a foraging individual to defend its feeding patch with its head lowered, and that more interactions occurred at the center of the group. Together, these results indicate that central foragers may reduce their vigilance rates in response to increased competition. Disentangling how the effects of competition and predation risk contribute to the edge effect requires further investigations."

Barking in Chinese water deer mainly functions as an anti-predator behavior against predators instead of sending signals to other deer. Stretching may function as a trial to tell the level of threats from a predator or function as a ritualized behavior which indicates the health status of the water deer. We didn't observe aggressive behavior in Chinese water deer. We used flight initiation distance (FID) as a metric to compare the vigilance level of water deer populations of different captive status, including captive, human supplementary water deer in Huaxia, captive, free grazing water deer in Songjiang, and wild water deer in Yancheng Natural Reserve. The results suggest that the vigilance level differs significantly, which means captive water deer decrease their vigilance level compared to their wild counterparts, however human raised water deer could be trained to increased vigilance level. Experiences with human, size of space, population density and the existence of fences may contribute to the difference of FID."
"LIMA, SL",BACK TO THE BASICS OF ANTIPREDATORY VIGILANCE - THE GROUP-SIZE EFFECT,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,49,11,20,10.1016/0003-3472(95)80149-9,1995,"A negative relationship between group size and levels of individual vigilance is widespread in socially feeding vertebrates. The main explanation of this 'group-size effect', the many-eyes hypothesis, is based on the simple premise that as group size increases, there are progressively more eyes scanning the environment for predators. Thus an individual forager can devote less time to vigilance (and more time to feeding) as group size increases without any lessening of the group's ability to detect an attack. Basic to this hypothesis is the assumption of collective detection: that all members of the group are alerted to an attack as long as it is detected by at least one individual. In addition, an important presumption associated with the many-eyes hypothesis is that individuals monitor the. vigilance behaviour of their groupmates in determining their own level of vigilance. Neither the idea of collective detection nor behavioural monitoring received strong support in an experimental study of vigilance in mixed flocks of dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, and American tree sparrows, Spizella arborea. The lack of support for behavioural monitoring was particularly evident; however, some degree of collective detection was apparent. It is possible that anti-predatory rules-of-thumb may explain the group-size effect while keeping intact the basics of the many-eyes hypothesis."

Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) is a group-living social animal, and a study was conducted in Qinghai Province of China during June August 2006 by using a continuous focal sampling method to investigate the influences of group size, sex, within-group spatial position, and nearest-neighbor distance on individual vigilance level (defined as scanning frequency per minute). Male gazelles were more vigilant than females. The gazelle's vigilance level decreased with group size (group size effect), but only for females. The individuals at the central positions within a group were less vigilant than those at the peripheral positions, but the nearest-neighbor distance did not have any significant influence on the individual vigilance level. Our results support the hypotheses of group size effect and edge effects, but the sexual difference in vigilance level and in the response to group size effect on vigilance suggests that there may be sexual difference in the function and targets of vigilance behavior of Przewalski's gazelles, which warrants more investigation, with incorporation of within-group spatial position, to better understand the mechanism underlying the group size effect and edge effect."
"LIMA, SL",VIGILANCE AND FORAGING SUBSTRATE - ANTIPREDATORY CONSIDERATIONS IN A NONSTANDARD ENVIRONMENT,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,30,283,289,10.1007/BF00166714,1992,"The commonly studied standard anti-predatory environment presents animals with spatially-distinct feeding sites and refuges from attack, neither of which necessarily obstructs predator detection. In contrast, tree-trunks provide animals with a markedly non-standard environment in which the foraging substrate itself may be a refuge from attack that unavoidably obstructs predator detection. Thus anti-predatory behavior in this environment should be influenced not only by a perceived risk of attack, but also by the nature of the refuge/foraging substrate itself. Downy woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens) are a common tree-trunk foraging animal, and an experimental analysis of their behavior suggests that they respond appropriately to their non-standard anti-predatory environment. In particular, anti-predatory vigilance varies strongly with changes in tree trunk diameter. Two modes of vigilance were apparent. In stationary vigilance, woodpeckers maintained the position of their feet while rotating their bodies side-to-side to peer around the trunk; mobile vigilance involved movement around the trunk itself. Both the frequency and angle of rotation of stationary vigilance increased with trunk diameter, as did the frequency of mobile vigilance. The woodpeckers also held their heads farther away from the trunk surface as diameter increased. All of these measures of vigilance increased under a greater perceived risk of predation. As might be expected given these results, downy woodpeckers avoided thick trunks; they did not, however, prefer the thinnest (least obstructive) available trunks. These preferences may reflect the influence of trunk diameter on thermo-ecological and/or anti-predator considerations not related to vigilance. Overall, this arboreal environment provides an unusual perspective on anti-predator decision-making with several implications for tree-trunk foraging animals in general."

In the winter of 1994-1995, wolves were reintroduced into parts of Yellowstone National Park. Foraging theory predicts that elk and bison would respond to this threat by increasing their vigilance levels. We tested this prediction by comparing vigilance levels of elk and bison in areas with wolves with those of elk still in wolf-free zones of the Park. Male elk and bison showed no response to the reintroduction of wolves, maintaining the lowest levels of vigilance throughout the study (approximate to 12 and 7% of the time was spent vigilant, respectively). Female elk and bison showed significantly higher vigilance levels in areas with wolves than in areas without wolves. The highest vigilance level (47.5 +/- 4.1%; mean +/- SE) was seen by the second year for female elk with calves in the areas with wolves and was maintained during the subsequent 3 years of the study. As wolves expanded into non-wolf areas, female elk with and without calves in these areas gradually increased their vigilance levels from initially 20.1 +/- 3.5 and 11.5 +/- 0.9% to 43.0 +/- 5.9 and 30.5 +/- 2.8% by the fifth year of the study, respectively. We discuss the possible reasons for the differences seen among the social groups. We suggest that these behavioural responses to the presence of wolves may have more far-reaching consequences for elk and bison ecology than the actual killing of individuals by wolves."
"Shrader, Adrian M.; Post, Julie F.; Hagenah, Nicole; Bateman, Philip W.",Is a reduction in the individual vigilance of mothers a key evolutionary driver of group formation in white rhinos?,AFRICAN ZOOLOGY,48,109,114,,2013,"A key benefit and evolutionary driver of group living is reduced predation risk. In white rhinos, groups comprise adult females, their calves and one to six unrelated subadults. Subadults benefit from group living through exposure to novel areas, and protection from territorial males (i.e. 'buddy system'). In contrast, it is unclear whether mothers benefit from group living. To determine if they benefit, or if there is simply no cost, we recorded the vigilance of white rhino mothers in different-sized groups. We predicted that as group size increased, calves would have lower predation risk and mothers would reduce their vigilance. In contrast, we found that vigilance did not decrease as group size increased. Our findings thus indicate that decreased vigilance is not a benefit that white rhino mothers gain from living in groups. Also, costs of group formation are minimal for mothers as their large body size and ability to feed on a wide range of grasses reduces competition with other group members. As a result, we suggest that the benefits obtained by subadults, coupled with the lack of costs to adult females, are the main drivers of group formation in white rhinos."

This is generally assumed to result from mate guarding (either against predators or other males). However, when males have conspicuous secondary sexual characteristics, they could be constrained to be more vigilant because of a higher predation risk than females. We attempted to distinguish between the male constraint hypothesis and two variations of the mate-guarding hypothesis by studying the vigilance behavior of the sexually dimorphic wigeon during early winter, when some males are in breeding plumage and some are not and when not all males are paired. The proportion of time spent vigilant by paired males in breeding plumage was five times higher than any other category of males or females. We found no significant differences between the vigilance levels of unpaired male wigeon in cryptic and in breeding plumage and therefore rejected the male constraint hypothesis. As vigilance levels of paired and unpaired females did not differ either, we rejected the hypothesis that paired males invest in vigilance to reduce their mate's need to be vigilant to predation risks. Paired females interacted less frequently with other wigeon than unpaired ones, and it is probably to protect their female from other males that paired male wigeon increase their vigilance times."
"Boving, Pernille S.; Post, Eric",Vigilance and foraging behaviour of female caribou in relation to predation risk,Rangifer,17,55,62,,1997,"Behaviour of female caribou (Rangifer tarandus) was investigated during the calving season on ranges in Alaska and West Greenland with the purpose of determining whether investment in vigilance behaviour differed between areas with and without natural predators of caribou. Female caribou in Alaska foraged in larger groups, displayed a higher rate of vigilance during feeding, spent less time feeding and, when lying, more often adopted a vigilant posture (with head up) than did female caribou in West Greenland. Moreover, a predation-vulnerable posture-flying down flat was observed in West Greenland but not in Alaska. Within Alaska, females with calves spent more time searching the environment than did those without calves. Finally, the amount of time individuals spent searching declined more gradually with group size in Alaska than in West Greenland, suggesting that what caribou perceive as a predator-safe threshold differs in the two areas. These results indicate that caribou, like several other species of ungulates, show behavioural adaptations to the risk of predation which are relaxed when this risk is reduced."

Previous work has indicated that individuals located at the edge of groups have higher domains of danger, thus are more likely to engage in vigilance or antipredator behavior. We studied the determinants of vigilance behavior in two groups of ring-tailed coatis in Iguazu National Park, Argentina. In addition to the expected pattern that coatis were more vigilant at the edge of the group, we found that individuals were particularly vigilant at the front edge of the group. This pattern conforms to predictions of differing predation risk caused by sit-and-wait predators with respect to mobile animal groups. In addition, coatis exhibited less vigilance when the number of neighbors within 5 m and group size increased. Of the three spatial variables tested, within-group spatial position was the most important predictor variable determining vigilance levels. These results confirm that spatial position has major effects on vigilance behavior, and that group directionality is an important factor which should be taken into account when measuring vigilance behavior. Coatis were more vigilant when juveniles less than 6 months old were in the groups. The presence of these young juveniles also affected the relationship between alarm response and vigilance levels. Coatis were more vigilant after strong alarm reactions, but only when young juveniles were not present in the groups. This may indicate that coatis give differential responses to alarm calls depending on the age of the caller. A comparison of antipredator vigilance between coatis and sympatric capuchin monkeys is consistent with the hypothesis that terrestriality leads to higher perceive predation risk for coatis."

In addition, we used group instantaneous sampling to test the hypothesis that grouping improves detection capacity through increased collective vigilance. We fit GLM to assess how group size and group composition (i.e., presence or absence of calves) affected individual time allocation of males and females, and collective vigilance. As expected from differences in reproductive interests, males in family groups devoted more time to scan the surroundings and less to feeding activities compared to females. Both sexes benefited from grouping by reducing the time invested in vigilance and increased foraging effort, according to predation risk theory, but the factors affecting time allocation differed between males and females. Group size effects were significant when females were at less than five body-lengths from their nearest neighbour, suggesting that grouping benefits arise when females are close to each other. Female time budgets were also affected by season, topography and vegetation structure. In contrast to our expectation, males reduced the time invested in vigilance as the number of females in the group increased, supporting the predation risk theory rather the intrasexual competition hypothesis. The presence of calves was associated with an increase in male individual vigilance; and vegetation type also affected the intensity of the group size effect over male time allocation. In closed habitats, collective vigilance increased with the number of adults but decreased with the number of calves present. Although male and female guanacos differed in their time allocation patterns, our results support the hypothesis that both sexes perceive significant antipredator benefits of group living."

However, where defenses are costly, hosts can benefit by facultative expression of defenses in relation to the risk of parasitism. The results of our model-presentation experiments show that Superb Fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) mediate vigilance around their nest according to their perceived risk of brood parasitism; when the risk of parasitism is high, they increase the time they spend in the vicinity of their nests. In combination with previous studies, these data suggest that Superb Fairy-wrens have a plastic defense portfolio that can be acquired rapidly and deployed facultatively to prevent parasitism while minimizing wasteful investment in defenses in the absence of parasitism."

Both partial correlation and multiple regression analyses clearly suggested that neighbour distance was the major determinant of the vigilant behaviour in the red-billed chough, even though group size would also exert a certain influence. As no significant correlation between the two variables was found, it can be assumed that the relationship between vigilance and neighbour distance is not spurious. Feeding frequencies were not significantly correlated with the other variables, except for temperature, for which a positive correlation was observed. Since the red-billed chough usually feeds on insects, which become more active and available as temperature increases, we suggest that the feeding frequency of the red-billed chough mostly depends on food availability. Our results are discussed in the framework of the hypotheses put forward to explain vigilance behaviour. The conclusion is that the 'individual risk hypothesis' explains the behaviour of the red-billed chough better than the 'many eyes hypothesis'."

In mixed-species groups, how species respond to the presence of other species remains a poorly explored question although it might give crucial insights into mechanisms underlying the interspecific coexistence. We studied temporary mixed-species groups of large herbivores in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe) between the common impala (Aepyceros melampus), the focal species here, and bigger species including the plains zebra (Equus quagga), the greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) or the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). In the Hwange savanna, the focal and smaller species are exposed to a larger range of predators than the associated species. In this context, we investigated how impalas adjusted their vigilance with group size comparing impala-only and mixed-species groups and whether the identity of heterospecifics affected vigilance of impalas. Our study showed that the time impalas spent in vigilance significantly decreased with group size when they formed impala-only groups, whereas it did not significantly vary with group size in mixed-species groups. Moreover, in mixed-species groups, impalas did not adjust their time spent in vigilance with the proportion of conspecifics and the identity of the associated species. Thus, the mechanism underlying the difference of impalas' behavioural adjustment of vigilance with group size between single- and mixed-species groups seemed to be related to the presence but not to the number and the identity of heteropecifics. Finally, we discuss the concept that larger and dominant heterospecifics were likely to increase competition for food access, thereby forcing higher vigilance of impalas, outweighing any reduction from collective vigilance."

Parakeets exhibited a highly seasonal and varied diet consisting of fruits, seeds, and buds, and they fed almost exclusively on birdseed provided at backyard feeding stations during the winter months. Birds foraged in groups of 1 to 31 birds, but most flocks were of 10 birds or less. Foraging group size was greatest in the fall and early winter, and smallest at the beginning of the spring when breeding began. Monk Parakeets adjusted their vigilance effort with changes in flock size. Individual vigilance effort declined with increasing flock size through a decrease in time spent scanning as well as the number of times scans were initiated. The number of parakeets exhibiting vigilance in a flock at any given time also decreased with flock size. It is likely that the highly adaptable and varied diet of Monk Parakeets contributes greatly to the persistence and growth of populations in a variety of North American habitats."

We tested whether foraging chaffinches Fringilla coelebs responded to background noise by increasing vigilance, and examined whether this was explained by predation risk compensation or by a novel stimulus hypothesis. The former predicts that only inter-scan interval should be modified in the presence of background noise, not vigilance levels generally. This is because noise hampers auditory cue detection and increases perceived predation risk primarily when in the head-down position, and also because previous tests have shown that only interscan interval is correlated with predator detection ability in this system. Chaffinches only modified interscan interval supporting this hypothesis. At the same time they made significantly fewer pecks when feeding during the background noise treatment and so the increased vigilance led to a reduction in intake rate, suggesting that compensating for the increased predation risk could indirectly lead to a fitness cost. Finally, the novel stimulus hypothesis predicts that chaffinches should habituate to the noise, which did not occur within a trial or over 5 subsequent trials. We conclude that auditory cues may be an important component of the trade-off between vigilance and feeding, and discuss possible implications for anti-predation theory and ecological processes."

We found that collective detection in mixed flocks of emberizid sparrows is limited markedly by relatively small degrees of visual and spatial separation between foragers. These limits on collective detection appear to influence the degree to which flock members lower their vigilance with increasing group size (the group size effect). Specifically, the decrease in collective detection with increasing visual and spatial isolation between foragers is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the strength of the vigilance group size effect. Explanations for the vigilance-related effects of such separation based upon a bird's ability to monitor the vigilance behavior of flockmates can be ruled out for our experimental system. Our results also shed light on the issue of whether the vigilance group size effect is influenced more by collective detection or the simple dilution of risk with increasing group size. We argue that collective detection is not only an important determinant of the group size effect, but also that the phenomena of collective detection and risk dilution are interdependent."

They also predict that when food is scarce in the environment, animals will have greater foraging efforts in the patch and hence shorter vigilance times. As an anti-predator behavior an increase in group size is correlated with a reduction of individual vigilance time. We evaluated Dolichotis patagonum's (mara) behaviors: feeding, vigilance, walking, and others (sniffing, grooming, resting) in relation to different food densities (100 g, 70 g and 40 g of alfalfa pellet, mixed with 5 kg of sifted soil, offered in wooden box) in a field experiment by using camera traps. As a novelty, maras showed nocturnal activity. They also showed an increase in vigilance time when they were in pairs compared to when they were alone, by alternating feeding and vigilance behaviors. When food density changed, no variation in vigilance was observed and food intake only changed between 100 g and the other two food densities offered. We propose that: first, maras are cathemeral animals. Second, mara's knowledge about patches is critical to assess patch quality; and that alternating feeding and vigilance when in pairs, could be and efficient anti-predator strategy in environments with high predator pressure."

In this study, an attempt is made to characterize the basic behavioural repertoire of the species, searching for differences between sexes. Focal observations of the most common activities were obtained in a breeding colony in southwestern Spain. Pratincoles did not equally distribute their time among types of activity, but spent more time in alert behaviour than feeding and moving, and more time preening than moving in the colony site. Males devoted more time to vigilance for predators than females, and both sexes increased the time spent resting and decreased the time for vigilance as the breeding season progressed. These sex-related and seasonal effects on the vigilance behaviour suggest that competition for females and ambient temperature influence the daily activity pattern of collared pratincoles during breeding."

Visual and acoustic cues may be important in parental vigilance: if vision is blocked, for example in a highly structured habitat, acoustic recognition of the goslings by their parents would be beneficial. We confronted parental and non-parental Greylag Geese with playbacks of gosling distress calls and analyzed their behavioral responses. Parental geese showed a significant increase in their vigilance behavior during and after playbacks while geese without offspring showed increased comfort behavior. In a permutated discriminant function analysis, we found no family-specific vocal cues in gosling calls, and potential call familiarity did not have any effect on parental behavioral responses. Vigilance in families was further influenced by the number of goslings and gosling age, with increased vigilance when the number of goslings was high, and when goslings were younger. Parental females were more vigilant than parental males, suggesting differences in parental investment between males and females. We conclude that visual cues may be more important in offspring-related vigilance than calls, which elicited different behavioral responses depending on the social class of the geese."

We observed that males had food in their mouths significantly less often when they were in pairs than when they were alone. Females had food in the mouth independent of the presence or absence of males. Among females that had been feeding, indicated by food in the mouth, we observed them feeding, as we approached, less often when they were in pairs than when they were alone. Among females in pairs with food in their mouths, we observed them feeding less often when their male partners were not feeding than when their partners were feeding. This suggests that females are alerted to approaching danger earlier when they are in a pair, and alerted earlier in a pair when their male partner is not feeding. Enhanced vigilance may be one function of pairing behavior."

Annual mortality from grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and wolf (Canis lupus) predation was higher for solitary yearling moose than for dependent yearlings (those with adults) and solitary adults. We tested hypotheses that solitary yearlings have heightened levels of vigilance and greater variation in vigilance responses and spend more time near protective cover than do dependent yearlings or adults. Proportion of time spent vigilant did not differ between solitary and dependent yearlings, and no differences were found between solitary yearlings and adults. However, variation in vigilance increased with distance to protective cover for yearlings but not for adults. Only at distances greater than or equal to 20 m from Protective cover did variation in vigilance differ between solitary yearlings and adults. increased variation in vigilance at distances far from protective cover, locations where putative vulnerability to predators is greatest, may account for increased mortality among solitary yearlings, Mean distance to protective cover was not different between solitary and dependent yearlings or between solitary yearlings and adults. Because hypotheses regarding differences in vigilance and use of protective cover between age and social status categories generally were not supported, other factors may be involved in promoting high vulnerability of independent yearlings to predation. Smaller body size and maternal defense are unexplored alternatives for explaining differential mortality between yearling with and without mothers."

However, the decrease in time spent on vigilance and scanning frequency following the increase in the flock size happened more rapidly for individuals in the center of the flock than those at the periphery. The decrease of the three parameters related to flock size significantly correlated with position. The time spent on vigilance and scanning frequency significantly correlated with the flock size and position, but not with scanning duration. Consequently, the number of individuals preferring central positions in the flock (a phenomenon known as edge effect) was increased by the increase in flock size for Black-necked Cranes in winter."

The main aim of this study was to investigate the role of the presence of predators in the functional adjustments of feeding parameters with patch quality in a medium-sized herbivore.In Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe), we set up an experiment by manipulating, over two years, patch quality for impala Aepyceros melampus, a medium-sized herbivore. We assess predation risk by monitoring the presence of three GPS-equipped predators: African lions Panthera leo, spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta and African wild dogs Lycaon pictus.In enriched, fertilised plots the impalas reduced step rates (i.e. the rates of change in feeding stations), and increased their number of bites per feeding station while bite rates were not affected. Thus, the main adjustment of their feeding was the step rate. The total time the impalas spent vigilant appeared to be a good predictor of the variation of their bite rate. Although vigilance caused a reduction in bite rate when at a feeding station, the impalas reduced the relative costs of vigilance by continuing chewing and processing their food when scanning for predators.When predators were in the vicinity, the impalas increased their exclusive vigilance (high-cost vigilance) but not their vigilance while chewing (low-cost vigilance) and decreased their bite rate while their step rate and the number of bites per feeding station did not change significantly. The impalas were thus visually disconnected from their patch, and reduced their bite rate when actually foraging. Exclusive vigilance increased when both lions and hyaenas were in the vicinity, and when wild dogs were nearby.Patterns of vigilance that altered bite rate were linked to the presence of predators during the previous 24 hr. Over the long term patch quality was the main determinant of the feeding parameters (step rate and bite rate). This study shows how predators, by affecting the time prey devote to predator detection, shape the functional adjustments of food acquisition by prey to local patch quality.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article."

Vegetated habitats may pose a greater risk for some if vegetation characteristics function as a visual obstruction but benefit others if they serve as protective shelter. Variation in group size, presence of similar species, along with variation in environmental conditions and anthropogenic disturbance can also influence vigilance investment. Methods In this study, we quantified the vigilance behaviour of two large-bodied, sympatric migratory curlew species-Far Eastern Curlew (Numenius madagascariensis) and Eurasian Curlew (N. arquata)-in vegetated Suaeda salsa saltmarsh and non-vegetated mudflat habitat in Liaohekou National Nature Reserve, China. We used linear mixed models to examine the effects of habitat type, season, tide time, flock size (conspecific and heterospecific), and human disturbance on curlew vigilance investment. Results Both species spent a higher percentage of time under visual obstruction in S. salsa habitat compared to mudflat habitat but in response, only Far Eastern Curlew increased their percentage of vigilance time, indicating that visual obstruction in this habitat is only a concern for this species. There was no evidence that S. salsa vegetation served as a form of cryptic background colouration since neither species decreased their vigilance effect in S. salsa habitat in spring compared to the autumn migration season. The effect of curlew social environment (i.e. flock size) was habitat dependent since percentage of vigilance time by curlews in saltmarsh increased with both the number of individual curlews and number of other birds present, but not in mudflat habitat. Conclusions We conclude that both migratory curlew species exhibit a flexible vigilance adjustment strategy to cope with the different environmental and social conditions of adjacent and sharply contrasting coastal habitats, and that the trade-off between the risks of foraging and the abundance of prey may be a relatively common phenomenon in these and other shorebird populations."

The study showed a range of individualised responses in managing attention resources in order to deal with vigilance demands. Alternating fluctuations between task engagement and disengagement were found for the majority of participants, indicating efforts to manage attention resources and cope with vigilance demands. Almost a quarter of the sample disengaged during the first 30 min, but a third showed no behavioural indicators of disengagement during the task. Different results were obtained for participants with different types of work exposure (novices and operators from either 'generalist' or 'specialist' CCTV surveillance operations). Task disengagement was associated with lower detection rates.

This vigilance group size effect has long been attributed to the anti-predatory benefits of group living, but many investigators have suggested that this effect may be driven by scramble competition far limited food. We addressed this issue of causation by focusing on the way in which the scan durations of free-living dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) decrease with group size. We were particularly interested in vigilance scanning:concomitant with the handling of food items, since a decrease in food handling times (i.e, scan durations) with increasing group size could theoretically be driven by scramble competition for limited food resources. However, we showed that food-handling scan durations decrease with group size in an environment with an effectively unlimited food supply. Furthermore, this food-handling effect was qualitatively similar to that observed in the duration of standard vigilance scans (scanning exclusive of food ingestion), and both responded to changes in the risk of predation (proximity of a refuge) as one might expect based upon anti-predator considerations. The group size effects in both food-handling and standard scan durations may reflect a lesser need for personal information about risk as group size increases. Scramble competition may influence vigilance in some circumstances, but demonstrating an effect of competition beyond that of predation may prove challenging."

Young animals look out for parents' arrival in order to start begging as quickly as possible, since a rapid begging reaction increases the likelihood of being fed before nestmates. If the young can physically intercept the parents, selection might be operating on the offspring ability to monitor parent arrival (vigilance towards parents) and any sudden modifications in siblings' behaviour (vigilance towards siblings). To investigate the adaptive value of nestling vigilance in the context of family interactions, we recorded which direction barn owl Tyto alba siblings were facing in 89 two-chick broods before the first parental feeding visit of the night. Nestlings were more vigilant towards nest entrance than expected by chance suggesting that vigilance towards parents is an important component of sibling competition. When positioned near the nest-box entrance where parents predictably deliver food, the younger individual (i.e. junior) looked more towards the entrance than its older sibling. Thus, when the likelihood of obtaining a food item is relatively high, juniors are more vigilant than seniors to detect the incoming parent. When positioned at the back of the nest, the senior looked relatively more frequently towards its sibling than the junior did in the same situation. This suggests that when the likelihood of obtaining a food item is relatively low, seniors are more vigilant than juniors to observe their sibling. Because vigilance was not related to hunger level and prey obtaining, we propose the hypothesis that vigilance towards parents and siblings only indirectly influences the outcome of sibling competition."

We found no differences in chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs, peck rates or vigilance patterns (number of scans per unit time, duration of head-up scans and duration of head-down periods) before and after exposure to four models: a ground predator (domestic cat), a control ground object (plastic box), an aerial predator (sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus) and a control aerial model (wood pigeon, Columba palumbus). However, chaffinches increased their rate of head turning after seeing a cat compared to other models. Our results suggest that vigilance is more than simply a pattern of head-up and head-down movements, but that different head movements when vigilant might optimize detection or monitoring of different types of predator and that predation risk can be inferred by vigilance type (e.g. head turning) and not just duration. These results imply that different head movements in birds may be important in predator detection and recognition. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Migration is one behaviour in ungulates that can lead to trade-offs between forage acquisition and predator avoidance. However, when forage intake is limited by food-handling time rather than by food encounter rate, ungulates can reduce foraging costs by synchronizing vigilance with chewing (multitasking). In this study, we compared patterns of vigilance, frequency of multitasking and total foraging time between migrant and resident individuals in a partially migratory elk, Cervus canadensis, population while they were together on their sympatric winter range. We used these comparisons to determine whether one herd segment had an advantage over the other in terms of forage intake and predator avoidance. Using observations of focal individuals, we found that residents were better than migrants at adjusting vigilance levels to spatial variation in wolf, Canis lupus, predation risk associated with a human-caused predation refuge. Migrant elk were less vigilant than residents where wolf predation risk was highest. Residents probably had an advantage over migrants because they were better at mitigating the foraging costs of vigilance by synchronizing vigilance with chewing. Migrant elk did not compensate for higher foraging costs by altering total activity time. Our study shows how foraging behaviours of free-ranging ungulates might contribute to demographic differences that lead to the loss of migratory behaviours.

We collected data on natural human vigilance behaviour in two different contemporary environments (a large refectory-style cafeteria and open parks) to test between four alternative hypotheses for this relationship: predation risk, searching for friends, mate searching and mate guarding. The results demonstrate that, at least in contemporary city environments, humans monitor their surroundings largely for reasons motivated by mate searching. Data on whom subjects look at in a busy environment indicate that males are significantly more likely to attend differentially to female passers-by, but that females show a less clear-cut discrimination. We conclude that vigilance patterns are determined by locally salient functions."

Here, we tested how this 'peripheral (head-down) vigilance' interacts with overt (head-up) vigilance and the collective detection of threats. Low barriers were used to prevent juncos from seeing to the side while pecking for food on the ground; a bird with its head raised could easily see over the barriers. Juncos and other ground-feeding birds preferred to feed without the barriers. When the barriers were present, birds generally took longer scans but spent similar periods between scans. Also, scanning patterns were less variable when the barriers were present. Following the threat-induced departure of a single bird, nondetectors were more likely to initiate scans when feeding among barriers. Barriers prevented feeding juncos from. seeing the early stages of threat-induced departures of flockmates and thus impeded the collective detection of attack. The results suggest that juncos value peripheral vigilance and that scanning patterns are affected by interactions between peripheral vigilance and overt scanning behaviour.

We tested if the need to guard females affected foraging depth in male teal (Anas crecca), and if they were more vigilant than females when foraging with submerged eyes (preventing monitoring of competing males and predators). These predictions were not supported, suggesting that foraging depth selection is primarily driven by other factors, presumably food related. A likely reason why deeply foraging males did not increase vigilance is that 37.5% of the foraging time was already dedicated to it. The apparent lack of guarding costs in foraging male teal may explain why such small ducks can maintain pair bonds for up to 7 months."

However, others suggest plant cover to visually obstruct detection of predators or conspecifics. We suggest these seemingly conflicting results can, to some extent, be resolved if overhead vs. lateral cover are distinguished. We recorded seasonal variation in vigilance activity of a natural population of degus (Octodon degus), a diurnal, semi-subterranean and social rodent from central Chile. We used these data to determine whether cover provided by herbaceous vegetation is mostly obstructive. The height of herbaceous vegetation in the habitat of degus varied seasonally, and the ability of degus (estimated from human observers) to detect potential predators decreased when herbaceous vegetation was high. This effect was more important for degus using quadruped postures and when dealing with terrestrial simulated predators. Accordingly, degus adjusted the quality rather than the quantity of their vigilance activity: male and female degus allocated similarly more time to bipedal vigilance when the height of herbs was high. Such increase in bipedal vigilance seemed to occur at the expense of quadruped vigilance instead of foraging time. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that cover of herbaceous vegetation is mostly obstructive to degus when active above ground, a finding that contrasts with previous evidence supporting that shrub cover provides refuges against predators. The differential effects of shrubs and herbs on degu vigilance are likely linked to differences in the costs and benefits associated with each cover type. For degus, shrubs may provide more overhead (protective) than lateral (obstructive) cover."

An experimental study,ETHOLOGY,121,831,839,10.1111/eth.12397,2015,"Whereas there are many studies of the time allocated to antipredator vigilance while animals forage, the vast majority of these studies remain correlative. This is potentially problematic because a variety of factors other than variation in perceived risk might influence putative antipredator behaviors such as time allocated to vigilance and foraging. We conducted an experimental study of yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) antipredator behavior while marmots foraged at a replicated set of feeding stations established 1, 5, 10, and 20m from their main burrows. Marmots appeared to perceive a reduced risk of predation when they foraged in the presence of other marmots; they allocated more time to foraging and decreased the time allocated to vigilance. When they foraged farther from their burrows, marmots initiated foraging after a substantially greater amount of time, tended to increase the frequency of their bouts of vigilance, and decreased the duration of each bout. Yearling marmots took less time to begin foraging than adults. Marmot flight initiation distance at our feeding trays was independent of the distance they foraged away from the burrow. Taken together, these experimental results demonstrate that marmots' perceptions of risk increased with distance to the burrow and decreased when other individuals were within 10m of them while they foraged."

We found that all individuals were more vigilant in situations of high predation risk, i.e. lower in the trees and in the absence of neighbours. Females were also more vigilant on the periphery of the group. However, there were variations in vigilance levels that could not be accounted for by the predation avoidance hypothesis. Males without infants showed higher levels of vigilance in areas of home range overlap than in non-overlap areas during the early phase of their tenure, strongly suggesting mate defence. In these areas of home range overlay where Thomas's langur groups can interact, males may attack females and infants, and so the infanticide risk for males and females with infants is likely to be high in these areas. Only females with infants, but not males with infants or females without infants, showed higher vigilance levels in overlap areas than in non-overlap areas; in addition, in over-lap areas, females with an infant were more vigilant than females without an infant, while this was not the case in non-overlap areas. Both females and males with infants were more vigilant high in the trees than at medium heights in overlap areas but not elsewhere. These findings can only be explained by the infanticide avoidance hypothesis. In contrast to predator attacks, infanticidal male attacks come from high in the canopy, and only occur in overlap areas. There was a significant sex difference in vigilance, but males were only more vigilant than females without an infant, and not more vigilant than females with an infant. We conclude that vigilance varied mainly in relation to the risk of predation and infanticide. Mate competition only played a role for males during the early phase of their tenure. Predation risk seems to offer the best explanation for vigilance for all individuals in the absence of infants. Both predation risk and infanticide risk played a role for females and males with infants."

In the Negev desert, diurnal fat sand rats construct their burrows in the ephemeral river beds (wadis), under dense and tall shrubs of Atriplex halimus, or on the open first fluvial terrace, covered with scattered low shrubs of Anabasis articulata. We tested the hypothesis that properties of the vegetation would affect the time budget of female sand rats. Sand rats spent more time aboveground, rested more, were less vigilant, and moved more slowly under the dense cover in the wadi than at the open terrace. No differences in the total foraging time were revealed, but foraging tactics varied between habitats: individuals in the wadi mainly fed aboveground, whereas those at the terrace mainly hoarded. Our results indicate that sand rats perceive the dense vegetation cover as good protection despite its visual obstructive nature, and that vigilance in Psammomys obesus is performed at the cost of resting rather than at the cost of foraging."

Poaching and habitat degradation are threats to the guanaco, a native South-American herbivore adapted to arid environments. Flight and vigilance behaviors, and guanaco-observer distances, were seasonally surveyed in mountain Andean environments, inside a protected area and surroundings. Field surveys and GIS analyses estimated environmental variables. Linear mixed models estimated probability of the mentioned behaviors and distance based on predictions about influences of human disturbance, social interactions, environmental constraints, and their changes over time. Flight and vigilance behaviors and guanaco-observer distance were higher in less protected landscapes, and near urban sites. Flight probability and guanaco-observer distance decreased over the years, being this distance shorter within the protected area. Flight decreased in summer, while vigilance increased. Vigilance was higher in groups with young, and lower in larger groups. Flight and vigilance behaviors were lower in slopes and higher in tall shrublands. These results are in agreement with hypotheses of risk-allocation, learning habituation, fitness maximization, risk detection strategy and foraging hypothesis. Social and environmental influences on guanaco behavior will probably prevail over anthropogenic influences insofar as current efforts to discourage disruptive activities are maintained in these mountain environments."

Psammomys obesus is strictly solitary, while Rhombomys opimus is mainly social. We compared time budgets of (1) solitary P. obesus females, (2) solitary R. opimus females and (3) R. opimus females living in male-female pairs. Solitary R. opimus females spent more time underground, more time in low-cost vigilant postures, moved more, hoarded food more and fed above ground less than paired females. However, females of both categories spent similar time in high-cost upright postures. These results conform mainly to the group size effect hypothesis, while the high level of high-cost vigilance in paired females can be attributed to within-group vigilance, masking the group size effect. Solitary females of P. obesus and R. opimus showed similar time budget patterns; however, P. obesus allocated more time to high-cost vigilance and less time to feeding. In general, differences in time budgets between heterospecific females of the same social status (solitary or paired) were less pronounced than differences between conspecifics of different status. Thus, variation in activity patterns of females can be largely explained by different social conditions rather than by species affiliation. We discuss the results in terms of predation avoidance strategies in solitary and social species. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Whether vigilance can serve the function of anti-predation depends on its unpredictability, meaning instantaneous randomness, sequential randomness, and independence, the three assumptions from Pulliam model (J Theor Biol 38:419, 1973). Here we tested two of these three assumptions in reproductive Black-necked Cranes (Grus nigricollis) in Tibetan Plateau: instantaneous randomness and sequential randomness.MethodsObservations were carried out in July and September of 2014, July and August in 2017 in Selincuo National Nature Reserve, Tibet, with the help of focal sampling method. For instantaneous randomness, we used Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for its negative exponential distribution; for sequential randomness, we used Run test, correlation analysis, and generalized linear model to see if an inter-scan and its previous scan were correlated.ResultsNot similar to some recent studies, we did not find a significant predictable vigilance in this crane. Most inter-scan intervals (86/100, 86.0%) passed negative exponential distribution test, meaning vigilance sequences with instantaneous randomness; most inter-scan intervals (91/100, 91.0%) passed sequential random test, showing vigilance sequences were random organized.ConclusionOur results suggest that keeping a vigilance pattern with unpredictability is beneficial to the survival of the Black-necked Cranes, which are facing with both cruel natural environments and high predation risks."

However, models fail to specify how animals are expected to look out for threats while actually scanning. We suggest that head movements during scanning may represent a way that animals can control the value of scanning while in groups. Head movements can be used to increase visual coverage (visual search) as well as bring features of the environment to more sensitive parts of the eyes (visual fixation). We conducted a seminatural experiment with brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, in which we manipulated group size and neighbour distance, and recorded vigilance for peripheral and central individuals. During scanning, the rate of head movements by peripheral individuals increased, probably to enhance visual coverage due to their higher perceived risk of predation. However, individuals that were farther apart and in smaller groups used a different scanning strategy by reducing their rate of head movements (e. g. increased the averaged time they spent holding a given head position steady), probably to fixate their gaze longer on neighbours. Visual fixation may be useful for obtaining social information about predation threats from the behaviour of groupmates. We show that (1) a vigilance metric associated with head movement behaviour, which is attuned to the visual system of a species, can provide novel information about vigilance in groups, and that (2) birds have different head movement strategies, probably associated with different visual targets, when the risk of predation is higher. 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Males in two of the four groups were more vigilant at waterholes than in other areas; males in two of the three groups having overlapping ranges were more vigilant in areas of overlap. There was a positive correlation between absence of neighbours and level of vigilance in both sexes. Male vigilance appeared to be directed primarily towards males in other groups, rather than towards potential predators or other group members."

The vigilance task required them to count occurrences of the word the in a spoken passage. Alcohol significantly impaired the performance of individuals but not groups. Group members performed at a similar level in both conditions, making fewer errors than individuals in the alcohol condition. The fit of different decision-making models were tested. In both the alcohol and placebo conditions, group consensus was predicted by processes consistent with the group monitoring hypothesis. The evidence highlights that under certain conditions, group process can compensate for the cognitively impairing effects of alcohol on individuals."

However, few studies have examined how natural predation risk factors interact with human-disturbance stimuli to elicit such responses. We observed American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) vigilance behavior from September-December 2002 on the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, South Carolina. A set of models was constructed based on 340 focal-animal samples and models revealed relationships between vigilance behavior, predator density, and boat activity. Oystercatchers increased vigilance in response to aerial predators, particularly late in the season when predator species composition was dominated by Northern Harriers (Circus cyaneus). At a broader temporal scale, oystercatchers exhibited the highest vigilance rates during simultaneous peaks in boating disturbance and Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) activity. Due to this temporal overlap of stimuli, it is difficult to interpret what may have been driving the observed increased in vigilance. Foraging rates appeared to be primarily driven by habitat and tidal stage indicating that time lost to vigilance did not effectively reduce intake. Taken together, these findings provide some support for the risk-disturbance hypothesis, underscore the sensitivity of disturbance studies to temporal scale, and draw attention to the potential confounding effects of natural predation risk."

This risk may thus be costly if vigilance interferes with feeding and/or if animals select poorer but safer feeding sites. We observed the vigilance behaviour of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, feeding in a fragmented landscape during and outside the hunting season and compared food availability and local landscape features at these feeding sites with random paired sites. Roe deer spent more time vigilant during the hunting season than outside it. During the hunting season, vigilance decreased as the woodland extent within an 800 m radius increased, but this was not the case outside the hunting season. Vigilance decreased with increasing distance to houses, both during and outside the hunting season. When food is abundant, interference with feeding may be low because animals can simultaneously process food (chewing) and be vigilant. During the hunting season, the total time spent vigilant while chewing increased with increasing food abundance to a lesser extent than outside the hunting season, suggesting a higher level of costly exclusive vigilance during the hunting season. Outside the hunting season animals selected feeding sites that provided more food, but during the hunting season, as risk (proximity to houses) was positively correlated with food availability, animals no longer selected feeding sites on the basis of food availability. Taken together, our results indicate that roe deer trade off risk avoidance for food availability in hunted populations. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We hypothesize that the observed interspecific interaction, although enabled by similarities in the behaviour of both herpestid species, might have been favoured by the shared use of burrows leading to interspecific tolerance and the high predation pressure put on small groups. To our knowledge, this would constitute the first reported instance of cooperation between two carnivore species related to predator detection."

Predation risk and an individual's response to this risk might therefore vary with an individual's characteristics. We examined the proportion of time different age-sex classes of kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and impala (Aepyceros melampus) spent high quality vigilant (costly vigilance that detracts from all other activities) in response to mimicked predation risk by African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). For both species predation risk was the main factor determining the investment in high quality vigilance behaviour. Age-sex class-specific responses were not related to age-sex class specific lethality risk presented by African wild dogs. For impala, regardless of predation risk, age seemed to have some effect on the investment in high quality vigilance with sub-adult impala spending more time high quality vigilant than adult impala, which is possibly why African wild dogs predominantly preyed upon adult impala."

In the Eurasian siskin Carduelis spinus, both resident and transient birds forage within the same wintering area, providing the rare opportunity to compare their foraging behaviour in the same area and habitat. The aim of this study was to test the predictions associated to the different hypothesized costs of transience by studying the vigilance and foraging behaviour of wild wintering siskins foraging at three bird tables with different predation risk and interference competition levels. Transient siskins showed longer scan durations than residents, either because of site unfamiliarity or subordination (i.e. prior-occupancy effect). However, residents and transients did not differ in aggression rates, contrary to the dear-enemy effect. Transient siskins did not show a higher allocation of time to vigilance, contrary to the hypothesis of compensation vigilance to reduce predation risk by dispersing animals. Moreover, transients increased pecking rate with increasing predation risk, showed lower scan rates, longer foraging bouts and, in males, presented marginally higher proportions far from cover. Altogether these results strongly support the hypothesis that transients incur a predation cost due to a less efficient vigilance and foraging system."

Avoidance of predators can be due to innate or learned behaviors. We tested the hypothesis that white-tailed deer fawns raised in a controlled setting with no exposure to native predators would have the innate ability to recognize predator feces via an alert response. To test our hypothesis, fawns were released into a pen in which predator feces or a control were placed. Predator feces evaluated included gray wolf (Canis lupus), mountain lion (Puma concolor), coyote (Canis latrans), and Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris). Plaster-of-Paris formed to a shape similar to feces and eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus) feces were used as controls. Presence of an alert response to feces was documented during 180-second trials. Vigilance behavior of fawns to gray wolf, mountain lion, and coyote feces was higher (P < 0.10) than that for cottontail rabbit, Bengal tiger, and the control. White-tailed deer fawns demonstrated an innate behavioral response to the presence of feces of native predators."

Once a forager chooses a habitat, it must decide how to allocate its foraging effort. Nubian Ibex are diurnal, social, cliff-dwelling herbivores. Many of their characteristics seem to have evolved as responses to predation risk. In order to assess the effects that perceived risk of predation might have on foraging behavior of free-ranging Nubian Ibex in the Negev Desert, Israel, we measured giving-up densities (GUDs) in artificial food patches and used them to gauge apprehension level. (Apprehension can be defined as a reduction in attention devoted to performing an activity as a consequence of reallocating attention to detecting or responding to predation risk. A forager can also be vigilant. Vigilance is often defined as time spent scanning the surroundings with the head up.) We also quantified time budgeting using focal observation of individual Nubian Ibex. Habitat preferences and patch selectivity as a measure of apprehension were considered. In particular, we tested the effect of distance from refuge on GUDs, the effect of micropatch structure on selectivity, and the effect of distance from the refuge and group size on Nubian Ibex vigilance level and apprehension. Nubian Ibex allocate their foraging effort more toward patches closer to the escape terrain. At the same time, Nubian Ibex are more apprehensive at intermediate distances from the cliff edge than nearer the cliff, and their use of vigilance increases with distance from the cliff edge. These results suggest that Nubian Ibex may switch from apprehension to a more extreme behavior of vigilance at greater distances from the refuge. This study demonstrated the use of antipredatory behaviors, apprehension, and vigilance by a forager. Estimating apprehension and vigilance levels of a forager simultaneously gives a more complete and accurate picture of how the habitat is perceived by them and combined with measurements of GUD allow a more accurate assessment of habitat quality."

This hypothesis was tested in a field study of Greater Rheas in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Observations were made during the breeding season by means of focal samples of individual birds. Females belonging to a harem spent 53% more time feeding and 62% less time in vigilance than did males with a harem. Contrary to expectations based on the hypothesis of a trade-off between group size and time spent feeding, males with a harem were as vigilant as solitary birds. Two types of vigilance with possibly different functions were distinguished."

The factor that most significantly affected the proportions of time that individuals spent being vigilant and their rates of vigilance was the position of a focal animal in the group; impalas on the periphery of a group were more vigilant than central impalas. Both measures of vigilance were also negatively related to group size. Males spent more total time being vigilant but females raised their heads more often. Impalas spent more time being vigilant in the late afternoon than in the early morning, when greater than ten metres from cover, and when predators had been nearby within the previous six hours. Impalas spent more time vigilant at the property where more impalas were hunted, possibly reflecting the differences in the intensity of hunting by humans on the two properties. Flight distances at the approach of humans were significantly greater at one property than the other, and were also greater for small groups. Further research into the effects of hunting by humans on animals' antipredator behaviours would provide valuable insights for wildlife managers."

Although the mechanisms underlying these behavioural patterns are still incompletely understood, decreased predation risk or increased foraging competition in larger groups have been put forward as two possible explanations. Since most empirical tests of these two hypotheses have used manipulative experiments, they have mainly been limited to small-bodied species or to animals in captivity. Here we suggest a time-budget model to test for the causal effects of predation risk and foraging competition that does not necessitate manipulative approaches. We used this method on two species of gregarious antelope, blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) and impala (Aepyceros melampus). We suggest that increased foraging competition in large groups drives the negative relationship between vigilance and group size in these species. This study shows that observational data can be used to test explicit hypotheses on species that are logistically unsuitable for manipulative experiments, and also render support for hypotheses suggesting that factors unrelated to predation risk are involved in shaping the differences in vigilance rates over different group sizes in gregarious species."

Humans have extirpated apex predators from many ecosystems, and the extent to which smaller predators, or humans themselves, can ecologically replace apex predators remains uncertain. White-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in the Eastern United States were released from their two most important predators a century ago following the extirpation of cougars Puma concolor and wolves Canis lupus. We studied the extent to which perceived predation risk from humans and a newly arrived mesopredator, the coyote, Canis latrans affects deer behavior, predicting that deer will be most vigilant in areas hunted by humans which also have the highest levels of coyote activity. We quantified deer vigilance rates in 33 natural areas of which 15 allowed hunting, across six states by evaluating the head posture of 3470 deer photographed at unbaited camera traps. We documented wide variation in coyote activity (0-2.5 detections/day) and human activity (0-306 detections/day), but contrary to our predictions, did not find strong positive relationships between deer vigilance and either of these predators. Deer vigilance was lower in areas with high levels of human recreation, suggesting that deer become habituated to the presence of humans. Vigilance increased across the fall season in both hunted and non-hunted populations, which suggests that increased vigilance may be associated more with mating behavior or environmental factors other than hunting. Our results show that variation in coyote and human activity does not significantly impact the vigilance behavior of white-tailed deer year-round, suggesting that deer rely on other risk-avoidance behaviors or neither are functioning as apex predators in the region."

During the breeding season, mammals tend to maximize their reproductive effort within the constraints of predation pressure. When predation pressure is reduced, greater effort can be allocated to reproductive behavior and less to vigilance and predator avoidance. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that elk, Cervus elaphus, in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), with predators, would spend more time in vigilance and risk-avoidance behavior than would elk in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP), a predator-free environment. We further predicted that elk at Mammoth Hot Springs (MAM) in YNP would behave similarly to those at RMNP because predators were absent in that area of the park. Cow elk in YNP spent more time in vigilance and less in foraging during activity periods than did cows in RMNP or MAM. Also, elk in YNP retreated to forest cover during the midday inactive period, whereas elk in RMNP and MAM remained in open habitat. Vigilance was not correlated with group size at either site. Cows with calves spent more time in vigilance and less in foraging than did cows without calves in RMNP and YNR Bull elk spent most of their time in courtship at all sites, but foraged more at RMNP than in YNP or MAM. Mean harem sizes were similar among the three sites: 17.0 in RMNP, 15.7 in YNP, and 19.0 in MAM. The proportion of cows with calves was significantly lower in the area with predators, YNP (0.10), than in the predator-free areas (0.24 in RMNP and 0.37 in MAM), probably because of greater calf mortality in YNP. Elk in YNP behaved in accordance with a predation risk, whereas those in RMNP and MAM showed less vigilance behavior."

Foraging behaviour was responsive to changes in predation risk. Feeding and vigilance activities accounted for most of the activity budget of foraging pademelons, and were negatively correlated. Reproductive females and individuals in smaller groups foraged closer to forest edges, were more vigilant and spent less time feeding. Vigilance decreased with increasing group size even after controlling for other confounding factors. Increased predation risks of feeding further from forest cover were offset by the pademelons doing so only if their group size was large, so that the time allocated to vigilance did not increase."

If we view fear as a state indicated by measurable changes in behavior and physiology caused by threats, then it is valid to search for a link between markers of fearfulness and predation risk. I predicted that domestic fowls (Gallus gallus domesticus) foraging alone, and thus exposed to higher predation risk, would show higher vigilance (a behavioral marker of fearfulness) and lower external body temperature (a physiological marker of fearfulness) than domestic fowls foraging in pairs. These adjustments should become less prominent in the continued absence of threats during a trial.Results: Domestic fowls that foraged alone rather than in pairs showed higher vigilance and lower external body temperature. While external body temperature returned to baseline values during a trial, vigilance unexpectedly increased. The results thus provide mixed support for an association between markers of fearfulness and predation risk.Conclusions: I argue that vigilance is not always a sensitive marker of fearfulness because hunger can keep vigilance low even in risky settings. By contrast, external body temperature varied with group size and time during a trial, suggesting that this marker is more sensitive. Future studies are needed to validate the relationship between markers of fearfulness and predation risk."

In addition, an inverse relationship between group size and vigilance has been documented repeatedly and is known as the group size effect. We suggest that groups of beach-foraging northwestern crows are vigilant for predators and for opportunities to steal ('scrounge') from conspecifics. We collected data using 5-min focal samples that recorded search time, scanning frequency and bout lengths, predator presence, prey type and theft. We also recorded group size, time of day, temperature, and tide height and direction, resulting in 2950 foraging trials. Results indicated that increased scanning during a trial predicted trials that would end in theft. Group size did not significantly influence the proportion of scanning in a trial, but scan bout length increased with increasing group size. This result is opposite to that predicted by the group size effect and suggests that more birds means more opportunities to scrounge or be scrounged upon. This rejection of the group size effect is most likely due to the trade-offs between group size and scrounging opportunities. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls enhances predator avoidance, reduces time spent vigilant and allows for more time on daily activities such as foraging. If the information is relevant and reliable, individuals that respond to heterospecific signals may benefit from a wider range of information at a low marginal cost. The Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris)and crowned lapwing (Vanellus chilensis) are ground-dwelling species that are taxonomically distant but share similar predators, habitat and anti-predatory behaviours. We used playback experiments of the alarm calls produced by conspecifics and lapwings to investigate the vigilance responses of adult female Cape ground squirrels. Squirrels responded with greater vigilance to both squirrel and lapwing alarm calls, and no changes of vigilance levels were observed in response to a control sound. However, contrary to our predictions, changes in vigilance and time to relax did not differ between conspecific versus heterospecific playbacks. The results from our study suggest that squirrels perceive lapwing alarm calls as relevant and reliable information and that responding to it could increase their survival."

Contest behaviour varies based on factors such as the value of the contested resources and the agonistic ability of rivals. Much work on animal contests has examined aggression, but vigilance, or a state of heightened alertness directed towards specific stimuli, may also be an important component of competition in many species. In this study, we measure the relationships among social vigilance, aggression, agonistic ability and resource value during staged contests over nest ownership in Polistes dominula nest-founding wasps. Our results show that both social vigilance and aggression are involved in mediating social risk during contests. Nest owner vigilance towards a rival increased with the time of season, a measure of nest value. Owner vigilance was also positively associated with aggression such that more aggressive owners were more vigilant. During contests, aggression of owners and rivals was influenced by different factors. Owner aggression was positively associated with nest size, another measure of nest value, while rival aggression was unrelated to nest size. Instead, rival aggression was associated with facial patterns that function as signals of agonistic ability; rivals were less aggressive to owners that signalled high agonistic ability than they were to owners that signalled low agonistic ability. The distinct predictors of contest behaviour between owners and rivals indicate that competitive role has a surprisingly strong influence on cues used to inform contest behaviour. Differences may occur because owners and rivals have different information and/or motivation. These results also suggest that social vigilance and aggression may be complementary behaviours that animals use to mitigate social threat. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Here, we examined this relationship in a large sample using the ANTI-Vea: a novel cognitive-behavioral task that simultaneously assesses the classic attentional networks-phasic alertness, orienting, executive control-and both the executive and arousal components of vigilance.Methods Two hundred nineteen meditation-naive participants completed the study. Correlational analyses using Kendall's Tau were performed between FFMQ scores and ANTI-Vea outcomes. Additional subsidiary correlations were performed between the FFMQ and two self-report measures assessing subjective attentional control and mind-wandering. Benjamini-Hochberg was applied to control de type I error rate. Internal consistency reliability indices were estimated for all measures used to aid the interpretation of the correlational results.Results Higher non-reactivity predicted overall faster reaction times and higher accuracy in attentional networks trials. Higher non-reactivity, as well as higher FFMQ total score, predicted faster reaction time and fewer lapses in arousal vigilance trials, the latter also being negatively associated with describe scores. The magnitude of the correlations ranged from tau(b) = .103 to tau(b) = .119. We found no association between FFMQ scores and executive control or executive vigilance.Conclusions Our results indicate that dispositional mindfulness is linked to improved global attentional and arousal vigilance performance, being non-reactivity to inner experience the key facet driving the association. The absence of association to executive processes is discussed based on the high cognitive demands of the ANTI-Vea task.Pretrial Registration Open Science Framework, https://osf.io/gb6c7"

Antipredator behavior includes proactive responses to long-term variation in risk (e. g., grouping patterns) and reactive responses to short-term variation in risk (e. g., intense vigilance). In a 3-year field study, we measured variation in antipredator responses and the foraging costs of these responses for 5 ungulates (zebra, wildebeest, Grant's gazelle, impala, and giraffe) that comprised more than 90% of the prey community available to the 2 locally dominant predators, lions and spotted hyenas. Using a model-selection approach, we examined how vigilance and group size responded to attributes of the predator, prey, and environment. We found that 1) the strength of antipredator responses was affected by attributes of the predator, prey, and environment in which they met; 2) grouping and vigilance were complementary responses; 3) grouping was a proactive response to the use of dangerous habitats, whereas vigilance was a reactive response to finer cues about predation risk; 4) increased vigilance caused a large reduction in foraging for some species (but not all); and 5) there was no clear relationship between direct predation rates and the foraging costs of antipredator responses. Broadly, our results show that antipredator responses and their costs vary in a complex manner among prey species, the predators they face, and the environment in which they meet."

Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are most commonly used for vigilance estimation. In this paper, we report a novel hybrid vigilance monitoring and warning system based on EEG and eye movement signals to detect mental drowsiness. This system collects eye movement information to quickly detect unsafe driving behavior and also gives real-time warning of driving fatigue by monitoring EEG activity. It also uses Fisher score electrode analysis to locate the cortical regions involved in vigilance and reduces the number of channels required. Fewer channels make the integration of vigilance monitoring technologies easier to implement and use as a vehicle safety aid. The self-adaptive system can provide various online monitoring and warning strategies for adapting to different individual physiological situations and complex external environments. For new users, the non-model module can be used for online monitoring without prior training and analysis."
"Beauchamp, Guy; Ruxton, Graeme D.",Disentangling risk dilution and collective detection in the antipredator vigilance of semipalmated sandpipers in flocks,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,75,1837,1842,10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.12.016,2008,"Collective detection and predation risk dilution are two nonexclusive mechanisms that can allow a reduction in antipredator vigilance in large animal groups. The two mechanisms make remarkably similar predictions in many contexts, and disentangling their relative contribution has proven empirically difficult thus far. We examined a situation where predators are more likely to attack from one side of the group. Provided that all foragers in the group can detect the predator equally well, the collective detection hypothesis predicts that all individuals will adopt the same vigilance level if this mechanism acted alone. In terms of risk dilution, individuals that are on the riskier side of the group, namely those on the attack side, are unlikely to benefit to the same extent as other groupmates from the presence of companions, and should have a higher level of vigilance than more buffered foragers further inside the group. We show that semipalmated sandpipers on the riskier side of flocks were more vigilant and thus pecked at a lower rate than those in the centre of the flocks and those on the less risky side. The proportion of successful pecks did not vary with spatial position within the flocks, suggesting that differences in food availability did not confound the above findings. We conclude that it is unlikely that collective detection acted alone and that risk dilution, acting alone or in combination with collective detection, shaped antipredator vigilance in an avian prey under predation risk.

To determine responses to gregarious behaviour, we studied foraging activity and vigilance of impala (Aepyceros melampus) near Kruger National Park, South Africa. We measured time spent foraging, vigilant, moving, grooming, engaging in social interactions and determined herd size and group distribution (i.e. density). We calculated accepted food abundance (AFA), food ingestion rate, steps per minute and percent vigilance for female, bachelor male and herd male impala. There was no relationship between herd size and vigilance, but vigilance decreased with increasing density (t(1,311) = 4.91, P < 0.0001). Additionally, AFA decreased (t(1,61) = 5.96, P < 0.0001) and steps per minute increased (t(1,311) = 14.38, P < 0.0001) as more individuals fed in close proximity to each other. Impala could be altering their behaviour to accommodate a perceived change in resources because of intraspecific competition and these adjustments might be related more to the distribution of herd members than to herd size. Further studies should examine the behaviour of gregarious animals in relation to the distribution of herd members in addition to group size."
"Switalski, TA",Coyote foraging ecology and vigilance in response to gray wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone National Park,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,81,985,993,10.1139/Z03-080,2003,"Coyotes (Canis latrans) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) have lived in the absence of wolves (Canis lupus) for over 60 years. I examined whether wolf reintroduction in 1995 and 1996 in YNP influenced coyote vigilance and foraging ecology. From December 1997 to July 2000, my co-workers and I collected 1708 h of coyote activity budgets. Once wolves became established in the Park, they once again provided a continuous source of carrion in the Lamar Valley and we found that coyotes began feeding on carcasses throughout the year. Although we documented that wolves killed coyotes, it also became clear that surviving coyotes quickly adjusted their behaviors when wolves were present. When coyotes were near wolves or in areas of high wolf use, they fed on carcasses much more; however, they increased the amount of time spent in vigilance activities and decreased rest. There appears to be a trade-off in which wolf kills provide a quick source of food that is energetically advantageous to coyotes; however, attendant costs included increased vigilance, decreased rest, and a higher risk of being killed. Changes in the behavior of coyotes in response to the reintroduction of this large carnivore may ultimately have wide-ranging cascading effects throughout the ecosystem."
"Sirot, Etienne; Blanchard, Pierrick; Loison, Anne; Pays, Olivier",How vigilance shapes the functional response of herbivores,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,35,1491,1500,10.1111/1365-2435.13813,2021,"Herbivores in quest of food have to attend areas where predators also concentrate their attacks. They have to deal with two conflicting demands, the need of feeding and that of avoiding predation. Using a theoretical approach, we study the influence of these antagonistic constraints on the shaping of an herbivore's foraging strategy and their consequences in terms of functional response.In our model, the animal may curtail predation risk by being vigilant while foraging and by limiting its time of presence in the feeding area. Being vigilant means either stopping all feeding activities to scan for predators (exclusive vigilance) or using the time spent handling resources to do so, with reduced detection capacities (routine vigilance). Using an optimization criterium, we thus determine how long the animal will stay in the feeding area and how it will share its time and attention while present there, as a function of resource density and predation risk.All behavioural variables show smooth but sometimes non-monotonic variations in response to changes in these environmental conditions. When these variations are taken into account, the instantaneous intake rate of the herbivore, as well as the total biomass of plant consumed, increase in a decelerating but continuous manner with the patch's richness, in qualitative agreement with a type II functional response. This smooth pattern is explained by the possibility for the herbivore, when food abundance rises, to progressively redirect its attention to routine antipredator vigilance.The relative importance of routine vigilance with respect to exclusive vigilance declines when predation risk increases, as well as the duration of the patch's visit and the total quantity of food eaten. The exact shape of the functional response is thus mediated by subtle adjustments of behavioural and attentional priorities, in response to variations in both food availability and predation risk."

Animal vigilance was measured by flight behaviour and compared in terms of area and group size. Distance sampling method was used to collect data on densities of large herbivores including namely; impala, kudu, zebra (Equus quagga), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), elephant (Loxodonta africana), warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) and nyala (Tragelaphus angasii), and in both study sites. The vigilance of impala and kudu were higher in Malipati than Gonarezhou (p < 0.001). Vigilance in impala was not significantly different with increasing animal group sizes in both Gonarezhou and Malipati (p > 0.05). Densities of common large herbivores were marginally different with Gonarezhou having higher animal densities than Malipati (p <= 0.05). Our results suggest that hunting is important in triggering increased vigilance behaviour of herbivores as well as influencing animal densities. Thus, it is important to monitor and reduce negative human activities on animal populations in the study area for enhancing tourism activities and conservation."

A comparison of three species of squirrel monkey (Saimiri oerstedii, S. boliviensis, and S. sciureus)",BEHAVIOUR,140,1421,1467,10.1163/156853903771980666,2003,"We compared the interactions between vigilance, risk from avian predators, and typical group size for three species of squirrel monkey (Saimiri oerstedii, S. boliviensis, and S. sciureus). Field studies of each species in relatively undisturbed habitats provided data including behavioral interactions between avian predators and squirrel monkeys and the latter's vigilance response, habitat use, group size, population density and within-group food competition.Three hypotheses were examined. The first two identified aspects of the habitat structure exploited by squirrel monkeys and their avian predators as key parameters. (1) The overall success of avian attacks is a function of the density of understory vegetation present to hinder these birds from closely approaching individual troop members. (2) The extent of continuous canopy forest cover within habitats underlies which of two vigilance strategies are exhibited. Preemptive vigilance occurs when monkeys allocate time to visual scrutiny in a manner consistent with the intent of obtaining advance warning on the approach of an avian predator. During reactive vigilance, in contrast, monkeys are not overtly vigilant against an aerial attack until an attack or other stimulus strongly indicative of immediate risk occurs. Preemptive vigilance occurs in open habitats with little canopy, while reactive vigilance predominates when birds can make effective ambush attacks from forest canopy cover. Both hypotheses were supported.Group sizes vary significantly across the three squirrel monkey species with S. boliviensis having the largest and S. sciureus the smallest mean group size. Our third hypothesis examined the premise that group size in social animals reflects a tradeoff between predation risk (whether based on long-term observations or extrapolated from habitat structure) and within-group food competition. The power of this tradeoff mechanism to explain group-size variation was contrasted with a simpler, one parameter model, within-group food competition under an ideal free distribution. The ideal free distribution approach was consistent with the observed ranking of group sizes, whereas the tradeoff model provided mixed results. In retrospect, the weakness of the tradeoff model is not surprising. Changes in the risk incurred by individual members of a squirrel monkey troop as a consequence of variation in group size are likely of much smaller magnitude than the risk exposure resulting from local habitat structure."

Biomechanical studies of these interactions are typically conducted in laboratory settings, thereby eliminating some of the ecological context. We studied how behavioural state, specifically vigilance level, of kangaroo rats affects evasion performance during simulated rattlesnake strikes. Vigilance levels were manipulated through the presentation of a tethered sidewinder rattlesnake. After predator exposure, we recorded kangaroo rats evading simulated attacks, and the videos were used to extract information about kangaroo rat performance. High-vigilance kangaroo rats (recently exposed to a rattlesnake) significantly outperformed low-vigilance kangaroo rats (not exposed to a rattlesnake) in both reaction time and take-off velocity, and executed steeper jumps. Although our recordings were not adequate for detailed biomechanical quantification, reaction times of high-vigilance kangaroo rats may be among the fastest recorded for mammals, with 36% of these individuals producing a visible response to attacks within no more than 8-17 ms and a group mean of 23.1 ms. This study demonstrates that behavioural state can have major effects on performance during predatory encounters. Therefore, under some conditions, laboratory studies of evasive anti-predator manoeuvres may underestimate performance in the wild."
"Ost, Markus; Jaatinen, Kim; Steele, Benjamin",Aggressive females seize central positions and show increased vigilance in brood-rearing coalitions of eiders,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,73,239,247,10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.04.010,2007,"Decreased risk of predation is a key benefit of group living, and selfish herd theory predicts competition for the relative safety of central positions. Spatial position also affects behaviour, as individuals trade-off their feeding and vigilance to mitigate the risk of predation. Female eiders, Somateria mollissima, often pool their broods and share brood rearing, and anti-predatory vigilance is a core parental care activity. Females are assumed to trade-off vigilance and feeding, as efficient recovery of condition is crucial for energetically stressed postincubating females. Evidence shows that a female's own ducklings are closer to her than unrelated young in amalgamated broods and that predation of ducklings by gulls is edge biased, so a female's spatial position should correlate with the survival prospects of her brood. We identified determinants of female spatial position (aggression, structural size, body weight, age, clutch size) within multifemale brood-rearing coalitions, and explored whether spatial position affected female activities. Female aggression frequency was the only significant predictor of centrality in brood-rearing coalitions, and female age was positively associated with aggression. Investment in vigilance, but not investment in feeding, increased with spatial centrality; instead, central females devoted less time to other activities (resting, preening and moving). We conclude that central eider females do not need to trade-off vigilance and feeding. Heavy body weight did not guarantee a favourable position in brood-rearing coalitions, which may help explain our previous finding that female eiders in best body condition when their brood hatches tend their brood alone.

"Fattorini, Niccolo; Ferretti, Francesco",To scan or not to scan? Occurrence of the group-size effect in a seasonally nongregarious forager,ETHOLOGY,125,263,275,10.1111/eth.12844,2019,"Group-living requires a compromise between safety and direct/indirect costs for individuals. The larger is the group, the greater is the collective vigilance, leading to a greater net food intake per forager because of the time saved individually from scanning behaviour. In turn, individual alertness usually decreases with increasing group size (group-size effect). Information on the occurrence of group-size effect is still unclear. Previous studies have shown that it may fail to occur or even reverse, for example when costs of interference between conspecifics are high. In turn, assessing whether the group-size effect would occur in weakly or seasonally gregarious species may help to understand its drivers. We evaluated the occurrence and the extent of group-size effect in a seasonally nongregarious herbivore, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus. We examined the roles of sex/age class and season as drivers of vigilance behaviour. In roe deer, the group-size effect did not depend on sex/age class: time spent foraging increased with increasing group size; in turn, vigilance increased with decreasing group size, in all sex/age classes. Females with fawns were the most vigilant sex/age class, thus revealing the cost of offspring protection. Accordingly, the higher spring vigilance levels of does could be related to reproductive costs (e.g., defence of newborn fawns). Conversely, the greater summer vigilance of bucks could result from patrolling/defence of territories. Both adult males and females also showed the higher vigilance in winter, likely because of an increase in the perception of predation risk and/or, possibly, hormones linked to an increase in intolerance of conspecifics, in males. However, the group-size effect occurred in all the seasons, for adult males and females. Our findings suggest that foraging benefits provided by the group-size effect may have overcome costs of group-living, even in a weakly gregarious forager."

Eight Gunnison's prairie dog, Cynomys gunnisoni, colonies in Flagstaff, Arizona (elevation 2300 m), were studied from April to August 2000 to examine the adaptive significance of colonial living in the context of predation risk and antipredator behavioral strategies. Each colony was sampled once every 10 days for a period of 3 h. Upright and quadrepedal vigilance was recorded using scan samples. All predation events were recorded. Results suggest that vigilant behavior in Gunnison's prairie dogs is an antipredator strategy because the animals oriented more frequently towards the periphery of the colony while vigilant. Gunnison's prairie dogs engaged in posting, an upright bipedal posture, more frequently than scanning, a quadrepedal posture. Furthermore, there was no relationship between either form of vigilance and population size. The proportion of animals vigilant decreased significantly only on the two smallest colonies as colony size increased. On larger colonies there was no relationship between the proportion of animals vigilant and colony size. The lack of change in the proportion of animals vigilant in larger populations may be a function of perceived risk rather than actual individual risk."

We stratified our observations in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA, and Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada, in valleys with three wolf (Canis lupus L., 1758) population levels (Saint Mary Valley: no wolf; Waterton Valley: moderate wolf; North Fork Valley: high wolf). Although the lowest elk vigilance occurred in Saint Mary and the highest in the North Fork, our analysis revealed a complex picture. Our model included distance to forest edge, group size, distance to road, social class, and impediments to detecting and escaping wolves. In Saint Mary, none of the variables were significant. In Waterton, vigilance decreased as elk group size increased (p < 0.00001) and increased as impediments increased (p = 0.0005). In the North Fork, vigilance increased as group size increased (p = 0.03), bulls were more vigilant (p = 0.02), and the interaction between group size and impediments was significant (p = 0.03). Where a high wolf population existed, elk did not exhibit uniform or expected response to predation risk factors. High wolf presence may necessitate adaptive elk behaviour that differs from response to moderate wolf presence."

However, the mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon are poorly understood. Understanding why behaviour is mimicked in some contexts but not in others is an important step in developing hypotheses about how and why some behaviours spread between social partners. Here we examine mimicry of routine vigilance during grazing episodes in a population of free-ranging bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, rams. Results indicate that vigilance bouts are more likely to be mimicked when neighbouring rams are in closer proximity, more familiar with one another and posturally aligned. Additionally, older rams are more likely than young rams to mimic the vigilance bouts of others, and mimicry occurs more often when the initiating ram is lower ranking than the mimicking ram. We interpret these findings within the framework of biases in attentiveness to particular individuals as a possible mechanism leading to the occurrence of behavioural mimicry.

Averaged for all areas, frequency and duration of vigilance bouts were less than 0.5 and 2.5 s, respectively.

Duration per vigilance bout was not different amongst the areas. Thus, while frequency varied considerably, duration remained constant, supporting a hard-wired adaptation to, among other suggestions, an open landscape. Plasticity in frequency allows for flexible behavioral responses to environmental factors with predation, domestication and hunting key drivers for reindeer. Other factors include (1) the open, treeless alpine/Arctic environment inhabited by Rangifer subspecies allowing warning time, (2) grouping behaviour, (3) relative low density of predators and (4) the anatomy and physiology of ungulate vision."

Growing evidence focused on human-altered acoustic environments suggests that anthropogenic noise can strongly interfere with the reception of biologically relevant sounds, causing a variety of behavioural changes in response to the evolutionarily novel acoustic conditions created by humans. However, little is known about how background natural sounds, such as river noise and biotic choruses, alter behaviour. Using field-placed playback of predominantly low-frequency whitewater river rapids, higher-frequency cicada choruses (similar to 7.0-15.0 kHz) or a silent control, we sought to determine whether background natural sounds influence vigilance and foraging behaviour in the California ground squirrel. We found that California ground squirrels exposed to low-frequency river sounds increased vigilance and decreased foraging and movement relative to ambient acoustic conditions during control trials and, to a lesser extent, acoustic conditions imposed by the cicada chorus playback. Additionally, vigilance increased with sound level regardless of whether the playback stimulus was the low-frequency river noise or the high-frequency cicada chorus. However, background sound level interacted with group size, such that increased sound levels were associated with a strong increase in vigilance in small groups but not in larger groups. To our knowledge these results are the first to demonstrate that the spectral content and amplitude of natural sounds can influence vigilance and movement behaviours. Yet our results match those from recent studies reporting increased vigilance in response to low-frequency anthropogenic noise, suggesting that many observed responses to anthropogenic sounds may be those that animals have used to cope with variable sound levels from natural sources throughout their evolutionary history. Determining how natural sounds influence other key behaviours is ripe for future studies and will likely prove useful for predicting behavioural adjustments in response to an increasingly noisy world.

Significant differences in behavior occurred between species for nearly all behaviors observed. A significantly greater occurrence of vigilance and approach behavior was directed toward the zookeeper while within the exhibit relative to when the zookeeper stood in front of the exhibit. A significantly lower occurrence of eating or drinking occurred when the zookeeper was inside the exhibit. Significant differences occurred across size categories in the occurrence of approaching the zookeeper. The most frequently scored behavior was visual orientation. Statistically significant differences in the occurrence of visual orientation directed by females toward the zookeeper existed across size category, with more vigilance by species with larger body size. A statistically higher occurrence of vigilance toward the zookeeper was directed by female ungulates but not by males when the zoo was closed to the public. Although no statistical significance was found regarding the intraspecific vigilance of males, data on females revealed significant differences across species and across size categories. When data regarding vigilance toward the public were analyzed statistically significant differences existed between species for females only. Likewise, when data regarding interspecific vigilance were examined, statistically significant differences were found across size categories for females, but not for males. The potential roles of vigilance in the wild are discussed in reference to its role in captivity."

We studied the vigilance behaviour of red deer in the Scottish Highlands, in sites with traditionally high numbers of visitors ('disturbed') and sites with relatively few visitors ('less-disturbed') during the main recreational season (spring and summer), and in their mating grounds during the hunting season (autumn and winter). We carried out direct observations, using scan sampling at 3-minute intervals for 1-hour periods, and recorded the number of animals in each group that were vigilant and their mode of vigilance. During the recreational season, in both the disturbed and less-disturbed sites, data were collected in habitats with different levels of cover (grassland, heather and woodland). The percentage of animals that were vigilant was higher in disturbed than in less-disturbed sites, and higher in disturbed grassland (poor cover) and heather (intermediate cover) than in disturbed woodland (good cover). The majority of the vigilant animals in disturbed heather and woodland habitats and in all the less-disturbed habitats were standing. In disturbed grassland, however, lying was the main posture whilst vigilant. In both disturbed grassland and heather, the percentage of vigilant animals that were moving was higher than in woodland or the less-disturbed habitats. In disturbed sites, the deer were more likely to be aggregated when vigilance levels were high. During the hunting season, the overall level of vigilance was higher than at any sites during the recreational season, and the majority of vigilant animals were moving. We conclude that red deer respond to disturbance from human recreational activities by increasing their level of vigilance, but that the nature of their response varies with the level of cover available. We suggest that red deer may lie down when keeping vigil in grasslands, because lying animals are less conspicuous and the low cover will still allow animals to scan their surroundings.

Vigilant behaviour was studied in capybaras under natural conditions, using focal-animal sampling on individual females, dominant males and subordinate males from groups of different sizes. There was a significant negative correlation between group size and individual alert rate, and a positive correlation with total group alert rate. Although the reduction in individual rates of vigilance levelled off at group sizes of 9-10, total alert rate continued to increase. The behaviour of the females accounted for most of the variation in individual alert rate and the behaviour of subordinate males accounted for most of the variation in total alert rate. These results suggest that females benefit the most from being in larger groups due to reduced vigilance required, while subordinate males 'pay' for their group membership by the vigilance they perform."

To examine the potential interplay between perceived risk and interference competition, we observed the vigilance behaviors of Ruby-throated Hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) foraging at artificial feeders with and without visual obstruction in the presence and absence of 3 species of wasp (Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Vespinae). Hummingbirds withdrew their bills from the visually obstructed feeder more rapidly than when feeding with a clear view of the surroundings. Wasps caused hummingbirds to spend a greater proportion of their visit vigilant, an effect positively correlated with the number of wasps at the feeding station. Aggressive competitive interactions at feeders were asymmetric. Hummingbirds avoided feeders with wasps and switched between available feeders more often and were never observed pursuing wasps away from the feeder. Instead, hummingbirds were chased by wasps or avoided foraging from feeders when wasps were present. Changes in hummingbird vigilance patterns in response to wasp aggression match those of other avian species whose antipredator vigilance patterns have been thoroughly examined. Thus, although interference competition inevitably occurs, vigilance patterns suggest that hummingbirds do perceive wasps as a potential threat and not solely as competitors."

Group-foraging nutmeg mannikins engaged in a producer-scrounger game search for their own food (play producer) by hopping with the head down and search for others' food discoveries (play scrounger) by hopping with the head up. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence to more joining by foragers. We tested this prediction as well as the extent to which stationary birds use head up exclusively for antipredatory purposes and hopping birds use head up for foraging purposes only. We observed three flocks of nutmeg mannikins searching for hidden clumps of food in an indoor aviary. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design in which both the distance to a safe refuge and the food distribution were manipulated. The use of head up by stationary and eating birds increased significantly with increased distance to cover. Distance to cover, however, had no effect on the use of the scrounger tactic or on the level of joining. We found no evidence of compatibility between the scrounger tactic and antipredatory vigilance. Our results provide the first unambiguous evidence for the existence of two distinct and incompatible patterns of vigilance for predators and for conspecifics.

We studied how varying levels of human, disturbance influence this function in the mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) along the southern coastal plain of Israel. Based on current theory, we predicted that changes in the slope of this function should be associated with changes in average group size. In heavily disturbed areas, individual vigilance levels increased in the bigger groups, causing the vigilance vs. group size curve to flatten, i.e., vigilance was high in all group sizes. Consequently, and in accordance with theory, we found a negative relationship between group size and human disturbance. Specifically, we found that-in open areas with low disturbance levels, gazelles wore in bigger groups than in open areas with high disturbance levels. In social species, the disruption of behavioral patterns by increased human presence can affect their social structure. Because social structure is a key component in the evolution and dynamics of social species, its disruption by human disturbance can have a considerable effect on population performance even if the disturbance does not, directly impact survival and reproduction. Social disruption due to increased access to natural areas should be an important consideration in managing fragmented landscapes."

However, intraguild interactions involving the world's most common carnivore, the domestic dog (Canis familiaris), have rarely been investigated. We experimentally examined the behavioural responses of a small canid, the Indian fox (Vulpes bengalensis), to the presence of dogs and dog odours. Resource competition between dogs and Indian foxes is low, so it is unclear whether foxes perceive dogs as interference competitors. To test this, we exposed foxes to neutral, live dog, and animal odour stimuli at food trays, and recorded the time spent at food trays, the amount of food eaten, and vigilance and non-vigilance behaviours. When dogs were visible, foxes continued to visit the food trays, but reduced the amount of time spent and food eaten at those trays. Foxes were more vigilant during dog trials than during neutral and odour trials and also exhibited lower levels of non-vigilance behaviour (resting and playing). In contrast, dog odours did not affect fox foraging and activity. These results show that vigilance/foraging trade-offs due to interference competition can occur between native and domestic carnivores despite low dietary overlap. These negative effects of dogs on a smaller member of the carnivore guild raise conservation concerns, especially for endangered carnivores. In many parts of the world, free-ranging dog densities are high due to human subsidies, and these subsidized predators have the potential to exacerbate the indirect effects of human presence."

We studied the behavior of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and pine martens (Martes martes) scavenging at carcasses of moose (Alces alces) killed by wolves (Canis lupus) in Sweden. Red foxes were observed visiting carcasses more often and at a higher frequency than pine martens, which restricted carcass use to certain habitats. Both species followed a similar daily and seasonal activity pattern. The seasonal peak of scavenging, in April for pine martens and April May for red foxes, showed that remains of wolf-killed prey are likely an important food source for both of these species during reproduction. Pine martens displayed an overall higher level of vigilance and a lower level of feeding than red foxes. Vigilance by pine martens was affected by habitat, visibility, and vegetative cover at carcass sites. Pine martens did not display increased vigilance during time periods of high red fox activity and there was no effect of the time of day. Our study showed support for the importance of interspecific predation risk leading smaller predators to trade off foraging for increased vigilance, but habitat characteristics affected vigilance patterns more than the mere presence of a larger predator."

Field observations on 15 free-ranging Great Tit Parus major basic-flocks were carried out to examine whether duration of anti-predator vigilance and foraging at feeders is related to social rank, group size and location of a feeding site within a communal flock territory. The proportion of time spent scanning was positively correlated with dominance rank. Removal experiments supported results of field observations revealing a causal relationship between rank and ability to choose the safest foraging behaviour. This result suggests that dominants can benefit directly from their personal vigilance. The lack of a relationship between flock size and vigilance time of dominants also provides evidence for a direct benefit of being vigilant. Dominants were free to scan more than subordinates only within their home ranges. When visiting home areas of neighbouring basic-flocks, dominant individuals lost their priority. This supports results of previous studies that there is a site-related dominance in the Great Tit."

Ungulate prey can use increased vigilance to reduce their risk of predation, but little is known of the combined and interactive risk effects from humans and wolves in determining ungulate behaviour across time and space. Understanding the interplay between these risk effects is increasingly important, considering the recolonisation of several large carnivores to more human-dominated landscapes in Europe.Aim. The aim of the present study was to assess the vigilance behaviour expressed by red deer (Cervus elaphus) in response to both humans and wolves in the Polish Bialowiez. a Forest.Methods. Using a camera-trap transect, the effect of distance to human settlements, hunting season, patterns of space use by wolves (Canis lupus), canopy openness, canopy height, time of day, as well as sex/age of individuals, on the vigilance behaviour observed in red deer was studied using a model-selection approach.Key results. We did not find a clear effect of patterns of space use by wolves or distance to human settlements on red deer vigilance behaviour at the landscape scale. However, red deer showed increased vigilance during the hunting season and during the day outside of protected areas and reserves, because disturbance from human hunters is highest. Conversely, we also found that red deer were more vigilant at night within more protected areas, which is likely to be explained by the increased activity of wolves because human activity is strictly limited.Conclusions. Our study showed that vigilance behaviour of red deer in Bialowiez. a Primeval Forest is more driven by human hunting than by the frequency of wolf presence at a landscape scale. This could be explained by the higher temporal and spatial predictability of human hunting activities than wolf risk. We found that patterns of wolf space use, as opposed to the omnipresent fear effects from humans, had only localised effects by increasing vigilance levels during night hours in non-hunting areas of the forest. The reverse was observed outside of protected reserves. Understanding how prey species respond to this new combination of risk from natural predators and humans, is increasingly important in a landscape where human risk is becoming ever more potent and carnivores recolonise."

The flush early and avoid the rush hypothesis suggests that animals that flee to escape approaching threats flee soon after they become alert to an approaching predator so as to reduce any costs incurred by ongoing monitoring of the predator. This hypothesis has been supported by several studies, but some researchers argue the relationship may be partially or entirely a consequence of bouts of spontaneous vigilance and/or bouts of spontaneous locomotion (vigilance or locomotion that occur when the animal is unaffected by a predator), rather than an economic decision related to the approaching predator. If this were true, spontaneous vigilance might incorrectly be recorded as alert distance (predator-prey distance when the prey becomes aware of and begins to monitor the predator) and spontaneous locomotion might be incorrectly recorded as flight initiation distance (predator-prey distance when escape begins). To evaluate these potential effects, we recorded the intervals between bouts of spontaneous vigilance and locomotion by yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). We used these baseline rates to conduct a series of alert distance-flight initiation distance regressions after removing potentially spurious observations recorded as alert distance or flight initiation distance. Although spontaneous vigilance and spontaneous locomotion may lead to artifactual increases in flight initiation distance as alert distance increases, the fundamental relationship remains after effects of spontaneous movements have been removed, supporting the flush early and avoid the rush hypothesis. We tested a key challenge of the flush early and avoid the rush (FEAR) hypothesis; our results provide strong support for the hypothesis."

This hypothesis was tested using 13-lined ground squirrels as they fed in four Plexiglas boxes that varied in the extent and location of visual obstruction. Adults and juveniles of both sexes were studied. Adults reacted to long-range lateral visual occlusion and total occlusion by withdrawing more often and assuming both more pronounced and lengthy alert postures relative to short-range lateral occlusion and no occlusion. Juveniles were less vigilant than adults and did not behave differently in the four treatment conditions. There were no sex differences. Simulated hawk attacks on squirrels feeding in the boxes indicate that the greater vigilance of adults led to significantly reduced reaction times compared with juveniles.

Indeed, meta-analyses suggest that group size only explains a small amount of variation in vigilance, and studies have shown that other social attributes, such as dominance status, also influence perceived risk and time allocated to vigilance. Social network analysis is an emerging technique to quantify a variety of specific social attributes, some of which have been suggested to influence 'security'. Using the proportion of time looking as an indicator of vigilance and predation risk assessment, we tested the prediction that more socially connected yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer, look less while foraging compared to their less socially connected counterparts. For females and males separately, we used observational data to create intrasexual, weighted social networks. We used principal component analysis to reduce correlated measures to unrelated and independent descriptions of connectedness. Using linear mixed effect models to account for potentially confounding variables, we found that no social network measure explained variation in vigilance. Social group size explained variation in female vigilance after accounting for variation due to vegetation height and date. Foraging group size and vegetation height explained variation in male vigilance. While social network measures themselves were not significant, our results mirror the fact that yellow-bellied marmots live in female-dominated societies and suggest that overall social group size is relatively more important for females than for males. Systematically studying whether and how social factors and intrasexual social relationships influence antipredator behaviour in other animals will create a better understanding of the benefits of sociality.

While predators may be elusive, their prey are more readily observed. Prey respond to the presence of a predator, and these fear responses may have population-and community-level consequences. Anti-predator behaviors, such as vigilance, allow us to sidestep the difficulty of direct field studies of large predators by studying them indirectly. Here we used a behavioral indicator, the vigilance behavior of the Himalayan tahr, the snow leopard's main local prey, to reveal the distribution and habitat use of snow leopards in the Mt. Everest region of Nepal. We combined techniques of conventional field biology with concepts of foraging theory to study prey behavior in order to obtain insights into the predator's ecology. The Himalayan tahr's vigilance behavior correlates with the distribution of snow leopard signs. Tahr actually led us to six sightings of snow leopards.

To investigate whether tail flicking functions as an alarm signal, either to predators or neighbouring birds, or as a signal of submission to conspecifics, I observed this behaviour in moorhen in a natural context, and conducted playback experiments using vocalizations of predators, conspecifics and heterospecifics. I found positive relationships between flicking and vigilance and nearest neighbour distance, and negative relationships between flicking and moorhen flock size and total flock size. Moorhen at the edge of a flock flicked at a higher rate. Single moorhen flicked more often compared with individuals in groups, both in single- and mixed-species flocks, and there was a tendency that single moorhen flicked more often than single moorhen within a mixed-species flock. Moorhen responded differently to conspecific and predator calls. While in both cases vigilance increased, tail flick rate was higher during predator playbacks and lower during conspecific playbacks. Furthermore, moorhen remained rather motionless when conspecific calls were played back, but not during predator calls, and, moorhen resumed to a baseline level of tail flicking more quickly after the playback of conspecific calls. Taken together, the results suggest that flicking may be considered as a honest signal of vigilance directed towards ambushing predators."

This group size effect could arise from a decreased perception of individual risk (dilution hypothesis) and/or an increased ability to detect predators (detection hypothesis). We compared individual and group vigilance of Rocky Mountain elk, Cervus elaphus, in three regions of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, U.S.A. that varied in their encounter frequency with coyote, Canis latrans, grizzly bear, Ursus arctos, and grey wolf, Canis lupus, predators. Adult females without calves increased scanning and decreased foraging with high encounter risk and small herd size. Adult females with calves increased scanning and decreased foraging with high encounter risk, but showed no decrease in scanning with large herd size. Yearlings increased scanning and decreased feeding with small herd size, but not with high encounter risk. Adult males were least vigilant, fed most and were not influenced by encounter risk or herd size. These age-sex class differences led to significant differences in group vigilance depending on the composition of the herd. Herds with a majority of mothers were significantly more vigilant than herds with a majority of adult males. However, these differences in group vigilance had no influence on the individual scanning of females without calves. Thus, the decrease in individual scanning with herd size may depend more on changes in individual risk than on cooperative detection of predators.

The proportion of time spent looking decreased as species body weight increased. Within species, animals in closed habitats, those with dense vegetation, tended to spend more time in looking than did animals in the open. There was some evidence that vigilance, presumably for predators, was shared by group members, but in 1 sp., impala, vigilance apparently increased with group size and with proximity to neighbors. Time spent looking varied with position within the group; this effect was strongest in closed habitats, where central animals tended to scan least and feed most. Vigilance increased as feeding success decreased, partly due to mutual interference between looking and feeding. The possible social, foraging and predator-detection values of vigilance are discussed. A simple model is introduced to help explain the effects of cover and to facilitate further discussion."

A further benefit is that individuals in larger groups can decrease the amount of time they spend being vigilant, while maintaining a high probability of predator detection. They may then gain extra time to forage, so increasing overall intake rate. Increasing group size, however, can also increase competition so that intake rates decrease. We investigated whether there was a foraging benefit in redshanks, Tringa totanus, that show the group size decrease in individual vigilance. Intake rates did not change with group size, despite an increase in time spent foraging. Interference competition increased with group size because individuals travelled more to find prey. Redshanks used the extra time available to forage to maintain intake rates under increased competition. Although the group size effect on vigilance did not accrue direct foraging benefits, larger groups formed, conferring other antipredation benefits. Intake rates were maintained because the interference competition was compensated by the benefits of reduced individual vigilance. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Many animals show a pattern of intermittent locomotion with short pauses that may increase detection and vigilance of predators. These locomotor patterns may depend on the microhabitat structure, which affect predation risk levels. We examined in detail in the laboratory the characteristics of spontaneous locomotion, scanning behavior, and the escape performance of Psammodromus algirus lizards moving in two different microhabitats (leaf litter patches and open sand areas). Results showed that in leaf litter, lizards moved at slower speed and had shorter bursts of locomotion both in distance and duration, than in sand substrates. This locomotor pattern allowed lizards to increase scanning rate and total time spent in vigilance behavior. When lizards were forced to flee, they escaped to longer distances and during more time in open sand areas, but lizards were able to attain similar escape speed in the two substrates. Lizards may be able to compensate the cost of moving between different microhabitats with different predation risk by behaviorally changing their locomotor and vigilance patterns. However, complex interactions between the visibility of lizards to predators and the ability of lizards to detect predators, together with the need of attending simultaneously to other conflicting demands, may lead to apparently non-intuitive solutions in locomotor patterns and the rate of vigilance behavior."

Both short and long single calls induced heightened vigilance in receivers, but rats did not respond differentially to the two call types, and it was concluded that P. brantsii alarm calls are not functionally referential. Multiple calls maintained a state of increased alertness in receivers for a longer period than single calls, even after the bouts had ended, but long bouts (duration: 64 s) did not lead to longer periods of vigilance than short bouts (29 s).

Chipmunks showed higher levels of vigilance when foraging in more open habitats, under high wind conditions, when they heard alarm calls and when surrounded by a high neighbour density.

However, social information transmission has been found to be affected by neighbour distance. Our goal was to assess the role of both group size and neighbour distance in explaining foraging and scanning behaviour in flocks of brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. We conducted a seminatural experiment in which we simultaneously manipulated group size (3, 5, 7 individuals) and minimum neighbour distance (0, 2.5, 5 m) of birds in visual but not physical contact. Foraging and vigilance were affected by both flock size and neighbour distance in different ways. Flock size generally influenced foraging and scanning behaviour, with an initial increase/decrease and then a levelling off at higher flock sizes. Neighbour distance also affected individual behaviour in a nonlinear fashion, but we also found patterns for pecking rate and proportion of time scanning that suggest linear changes. We found that the strength of the group-size effect varied with neighbour distance and was weakest when the birds were furthest away from each other.

In accordance with previous studies of other primates, vigilant tamarins of both species were significantly further away from their nearest neighbours, and were also at lower heights in the forest than non-vigilant individuals. There was no observed sex difference in the amount of time spent vigilant. In terms of modes of scanning, the saddleback tamarins looked up significantly more frequently than the moustached tamarins, whereas there was no difference between the species in the frequency of side sweeps. There were no differences between the sexes in the frequencies of either type of vigilant behaviour. The proportion of time spent vigilant was higher than average immediately prior to entering a sleeping site for saddleback tamarins, but not for moustached tamarins. Both species were more vigilant immediately after exiting a sleeping site than at other times of the day. There was significant variation in the amount of time devoted to vigilance over the course of the year. These findings are discussed with respect to the social structure, ecology and main predator threats facing these species."

I examined the effect of underwater foraging on head-up position in spring staging dunlins (Calidris alpina), predicting that this type of foraging would positively affect the frequency of head-up vigilance in this species. The results of analysis showed that significant predictors of the occurrence of head-up positions were underwater foraging and head-up position that occurred in the imminent past. Results of this study imply that dunlins are less likely to raise their heads above the shoulder line if they have not obstructed their vision by underwater foraging in the previous moment and that birds are able to acquire visual information from their surroundings not only when their heads are in the upright position but also during head-down foraging and/or during horizontal head position."

Using a theoretical approach, I studied how differences in this predation regime may influence allocation to antipredator defence in a foraging prey. I considered a set of two complementary defensive tactics, namely, the possibility for the prey to shorten its activity periods, to reduce exposure to predatory attacks and sacrifice some of its foraging time to vigilance, to get a better chance of escaping when under attack. The model reveals relatively complex behavioural adaptations, with important consequences for the energy balance of the animal. In particular, a hierarchy emerges between the two levels of decisions and, as a consequence, the two types of defensive tactics do not respond in a uniform way to changes in environmental conditions. Animals living in relatively safe habitats are thus expected to devote all their time to foraging and adjust their vigilance to the level of risk they endure, while animals living in more dangerous places are expected to adjust the length of their foraging periods to the prevailing level of risk. If the level of risk varies, the animals will avoid being active during infrequent, or particularly deadly, high-risk periods. If these periods become more frequent, or less dangerous, the animals will be fully active, and adjust their vigilance, during low-risk periods, and only partially active during high-risk periods. Finally, when dangerous periods further increase in length or decrease in intensity, the animals will use all available foraging time, and adjust their vigilance during both low- and high-risk periods to the predation regime. Antipredator strategies must then be perceived as a set of behavioural decisions, not only connected to one another, but also embedded within one another, which mediate energy transfers between three consecutive trophic levels.

Therefore, an accurate estimation of the driver's alertness status plays an important part. To estimate vigilance, we adopt a novel strategy that is a deep autoencoder with subnetwork nodes (DAE(SN)). The proposed network model is designed not only for sparse representation but also for dimension reduction. Some hidden layers are not calculated by randomly acquired, but by replacement technologies. Unlike the traditional electrooculogram (EOG) signals, the forehead EOG (EOG(F)) signals are collected through forehead electrodes that do not have to surround the eyes, which has a convenient and effective practical application. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (COR) while separately using three EOG(F) features improved to 0.11/0.79, 0.10/0.83, and 0.11/0.80, respectively. Implemented in an experimental environment, percentage of eye closure over time is calculated in real time through SMI eye-tracking-glasses, up to 120 frames/s. In addition, the time to extract features from the raw signal and display the prediction is only 34 ms, that is the level of the driver's fatigue can be detected quickly. The experimental study shows that the proposed model for vigilance analysis has better robustness and learning capability."

To this aim we observed the response of 114 partridge (57 males and 57 females) to dummy terrestrial and aerial predators, a raptor and a fox. We divided behavioural responses to predators into four mutually exclusive categories: vigilance, freezing, escape and non-anti-predator behaviours. We also recorded and analysed the vocalizations emitted during tests. The animals reacted differently to aerial and terrestrial stimuli. The reactions elicited by the terrestrial predator were ranked as follows: vigilance, escape, non-anti-predator behaviours, and freezing. Those elicited by the aerial predator were ranked as follows: vigilance, freezing, escape and non-anti-predator behaviours. Vigilance and escape were elicited more frequently by the terrestrial predator than by the aerial predator (vigilance: p 0.001; escape: p 0.001). Freezing was the most frequent behaviour following the appearance of the aerial predator (p 0.001). In fact, freezing may represent an effective strategy in an open space, combining camouflage from and detection by the predator. On the other hand, vigilance is an effective behaviour to detect and avoid a terrestrial predator hunting by ambush. We did not find clear-cut differences between sexes. The analysis of vocalizations revealed that the fox and the raptor elicited significantly different calls (p = 0.003); the fox evoked significantly more vocalizations than the raptor (p 0.001), differing in addition in frequency parameters. Thus partridges not only discriminate between aerial and terrestrial predators and behave consequently, but are also able to tune alarm calls in relation to the context of predation."

However, the benefit of grouping (a decline in individual vigilance despite an increase in collective vigilance, with a concomitant increase in individual feeding time) has not been evoked as a factor promoting shared care. Eider females, Somateria mollissima, are subject to substantial energetic costs during breeding, and sometimes share brood-rearing duties. We compared the activity budgets and feeding behaviour of lone tenders and multifemale tenders. We also measured the collective vigilance of multifemale tenders and examined whether the coordination of feeding activity among females changes with time. As expected, the proportion of time spent feeding increased, and the proportion of time spent vigilant decreased, as the number of females attending the brood increased. None the less, the collective vigilance of multifemale tenders was at least 20% higher than the vigilance of lone tenders. Furthermore, multifemale tending allowed females to feed more optimally, as dive duration increased with the number of females tending the brood. The level of parental investment by individual females after hatching of the eggs is therefore related to the number of tending females and, based on previous work, a female's body condition when the eggs hatch is also logically connected with the number of tending females. Whether females sharing brood care on a permanent basis coordinate their feeding activity, so as to increase the potential protection of ducklings against predation, remains equivocal.

Moreover, none of the studies that have avoided the confusion has considered all the vigilance variables, food intake rate and time spent in the foraging patch. In this study, we designed an experiment with Eurasian siskins Carduelis spinus foraging on three bird table feeders: one with low predation risk and competition, one with low predation risk and high competition and one with high predation risk and intermediate competition. Birds responded to increasing interference competition by increasing mean scan durations (probably due to the birds having to be vigilant for both other flock members and predators) and maintaining the length of mean inter- scan durations, while they responded to increasing predation risk by reducing mean inter- scan durations (probably in order to detect the predator sooner) while maintaining similar length of mean scan durations. Birds were often ejected from the feeder or departed because of disturbances, so time spent on feeders was reduced both because of competition and predation risk. Pecking rates were affected by competition but not by predation risk. Our results clearly show that birds vigilance strategy while foraging might be very different when they are mainly concerned with scanning for predators or when they primarily monitor competing flock companions. In addition, they stress the importance of recording all the vigilance and feeding variables when studying the effect of ecological factors over the foraging behaviour of birds."

Visual obstructions can conceal both potential predators and flock mates from a foraging bird, and individuals may increase their scanning rate accordingly, although concealing flock mates may result in more variable scanning rates as they come in and out of vision. We examined these ideas experimentally by observing house sparrows foraging at a feeder with and without visual obstructions. Birds foraging in the presence of visual obstructions had generally higher and more variable scanning rates. When the birds were approached by a human observer, they took flight earlier in larger flocks, although their reaction was generally delayed when there were obstructions. These data indicate that visual obstructions increase the probability of predation because individuals are less likely to detect a predator and/or the alarm flight of other individuals."

These differences can involve consistent variation in the level of a particular behaviour (personality) or differences in the way individuals adjust their behaviour to environmental gradients (plasticity). In prey species, feeding rates and vigilance vary with environmental, social and individual factors and the feeding rate/vigilance relationship reflects the trade-off between food acquisition and safety. While feeding rates and vigilance have been shown to vary between individuals in relation to group size and predation risk, how they relate to other factors has not yet been investigated, nor has between-individual variation in this trade-off. We studied between-individual variation in vigilance, feeding rates and their trade-off in female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, to see whether females showed consistent behavioural differences and different plasticity in relation to ecological (food patch richness), social (group sizes) and physiological (reproductive states) conditions. We addressed two contrasting hypotheses: an 'ecological' hypothesis under which individuals facing the same conditions should behave similarly, and a 'behavioural' hypothesis under which they should behave differently because of their own personality or plasticity. Female kangaroos tended to adjust their behaviours similarly in relation to ecological and social conditions, supporting the ecological hypothesis. However, they also showed differences in personality and plasticity in relation to their reproductive states that could not be explained by energetic demand alone; this was suggestive of different maternal strategies, thus supporting the behavioural hypothesis. Altogether these results suggest that consistent differences in animals' personality and behavioural plasticity can be promoted by physiological conditions and are not necessarily repeatable across different ecological contexts.

The Allee effect (inverse density dependence) can be generated when antipredator strategies become inefficient in small groups of prey, thus making the population more susceptible to catastrophic population collapse and extinction. Many populations of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are declining, and predation is, in many cases, a major mortality factor. We studied desert bighorns at the Red Rock Wildlife Area, New Mexico, USA, to assess predation risk in different group types (ram, ewe, mixed) and age-sex classes. Multiple regression analysis revealed that predation risk (as estimated by individual vigilance) increased with smaller group size and greater inter-individual distance for all bighorns, with groups of <5 individuals subject to the greatest risk. Although rugged terrain is thought to provide refuge from predators, habitat ruggedness did not influence vigilance. The biggest males in ram groups experienced the greatest predation risk in that they were in the smallest groups, were most likely to be solitary, and were spaced farther apart from conspecifics. Although big rams spent twice as much time vigilant as other age-sex classes, collective alertness was lowest for ram groups. The conclusion that big rams were most at risk from predation was partially supported by the recent predation history of the population and previous studies in which mountain lion (Felis concolor) kills were biased toward rams. We discuss the management implications of these results for small populations subject to Allee effects, including reintroduction and/or translocation practices and selective removal of problem predators. We suggest that the use of multivariate techniques to simultaneously explore the influence of multiple factors and the use of vigilance as a correlate of predation risk would be useful management tools for assessing seasonal and class-specific vulnerability to predation."

We videotaped central place foraging chipmunks, Tamias striatus, as they approached a patch, collected sunflower seeds, and left to return to their burrows. There was a strong similarity between head raising during foraging and pausing during intermittent locomotion. Chipmunks paused more frequently when moving towards the patch than when leaving the patch. Chipmunks in the patch raised their heads at an intermediate rate, which tended to decrease with time in the patch. Pauses and the duration of motionless periods during head raises were very short (similar to0.4 s), and their frequency distributions were similar. Animals remained motionless during 22% of the time spent approaching the patch, 14% of the time spent in the patch and 7% of the time spent leaving the patch. Rates of pausing and head raising generally decreased with short-term familiarity (number of trips to the patch) and with long-term familiarity (proximity of the patch to the burrow). Trials with higher pause rates when approaching the patch had higher head-raising rates in the patch. Whether the focal individual was solitary, dominant or subordinate in a dyad, or competing with multiple chipmunks in the patch had no effect on pausing or head raising. In a separate experiment, exposure to a model hawk increased pause and head-raising rates. We conclude that head raising during foraging and pausing during locomotion serve a similar vigilance function, that this vigilance is directed towards detection of predators rather than conspecifics, and that time allocated to vigilance is sufficient to significantly reduce foraging rates and affect many space use and foraging decisions.

Since body mass could also influence the animal's sensitivity to predation risk, its vigilance behaviour should consequently be affected. Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) is characterised by a strong dimorphism among males of different ages, thus representing an ideal case study for testing the Jarman-Bell principle, avoiding possibly misleading effects resulting from the comparison between different species or genders. We analysed the fine-scale foraging behaviour of male ibex in order to assess the effect of body mass and the effects of vegetation quality/quantity on both foraging and vigilance behaviour. Our results showed that smaller males were more selective than larger ones, on account of their lower capability of digesting plant. Smaller males scanned the environment more frequently than larger ones. Male ibex grazed more selectively in sites with high quality forage and their bite rate increased as forage biomass decreased. Vigilance frequency increased with increasing forage biomass as, under these circumstances, ibex are able to prolong anti-predator vigilance while chewing bites that have already been cropped. Our findings highlight the effects of body mass per se on both foraging and anti-predator behaviours in herbivores, thus supporting the Jarman-Bell principle. Foraging can arguably be considered a very flexible behaviour with high evolutionary relevance as it enables herbivores to optimally adjust their total energy intake under varying conditions of food resources."

Factors that affect threat detection have rarely been investigated in the context of food competition. I examined the ability to detect threats of displacement from feeding areas by competitors in flocks of staging Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla (L., 1766)). I predicted that targeted birds would be more likely to detect competitors attacking from the side or from the front rather than from behind because a blind area behind the head interferes with detection. Preening or sleeping birds in feeding areas might be less likely to detect attacks if such activities interfere with vigilance. If targeted birds maintain vigilance against attackers, attacks launched from farther away should be detected more frequently since more time is available for detection. As predicted, attacks were detected less often when launched from behind and more often when launched from farther away. The longest attacks were detected less often perhaps because birds relaxed their vigilance when neighbours were farther away. The ability to detect threats did not vary with targeted bird activity. Several factors influence the ability to detect threats from food competitors providing us with a novel context in which to investigate threat detection."

In all cases, animals responded to the unfamiliar human with increased vigilant behavior, i.e., they spent more time oriented towards the unfamiliar handler during the first 2 min of the test session than during the same interval of either the final habituation session or the retest with the familiar human (P = 0.03 in all cases). There was also a tendency for seals to contact the familiar handler with their noses more rapidly than the novel human (P = 0.06). These results support the hypothesis that phocid seals are capable of discriminating between individual humans in their environment, setting the stage for human-based Pavlovian conditioning."

Both roadway traffic noise and naturally-occurring river noise engender similar changes in behavior. These results suggest that noisy environments, natural and human-created, alter important risk-management behaviors in sparrows and possibly other birds.Animals glean information about risk from their habitat. The acoustic environment is one such source of information, and is an important, yet understudied ecological axis. Although anthropogenic noise has become recently ubiquitous, risk mitigation behaviors have likely been shaped by natural noise over millennia. Listening animals have been shown to increase vigilance and decrease foraging in both natural and anthropogenic noise. However, direct comparisons could be informative to conservation and understanding evolutionary drivers of behavior in noise. Here, we used 27 song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) and 148 laboratory behavioral trials to assess foraging and vigilance behavior in both anthropogenic and natural noise sources. Using five acoustic environments (playbacks of roadway traffic, a whitewater river, a whitewater river shifted upwards in frequency, a river with the amplitude modulation of roadway traffic, and an ambient control), we attempt to parse out the acoustic characteristics that make a foraging habitat risky. We found that sparrows increased vigilance or decreased foraging in 4 of 6 behaviors when foraging in higher sound levels regardless of the noise source or variation in frequency and amplitude modulation. These responses may help explain previously reported declines in abundance of song sparrows exposed to playback of intense river noise. Our results imply that natural soundscapes have likely shaped behavior long before anthropogenic noise, and that high sound levels negatively affect the foraging-vigilance trade-off in most intense acoustic environments. Given the ever-increasing footprint of noise pollution, these results imply potential negative consequences for bird populations."

Using wild birds temporarily housed in outdoor aviaries, we investigated the influence of group size (I, 2 and 4 individuals) on individual time budget (vigilance vs. foraging), and the pecking (number of pecks) and intake rates (number of seeds consumed). Results showed that individuals reduced their vigilance and increased their pecking rate when group size increased. However, the intake rate was not maximised in the largest group suggesting that large flocks would negatively affect individual foraging efficiency. A consideration of the whole set of costs and benefits will be necessary before the adaptive value of group living in any species can be fully assessed."

The giraffe is the tallest land mammal, maintains high vigilance levels, and has good eyesight. As a result, heterospecific herd members could reduce their predation risk if they keyed off the giraffe's antipredator behaviors. However, because giraffe rarely use audible alarm snorts, heterospecifics would need to eavesdrop on cues given off by the giraffe that indicate predator presence (e.g., body posture), to benefit from herding with giraffe. To test this, we compared the vigilance of zebra herding with conspecifics, with those herding with giraffe. Our results indicate that giraffe reduce zebra vigilance in zebra-giraffe herds and that in these herds, giraffe are the primary source of information regarding predation risk. In contrast, when zebra herd with conspecifics, they rely primarily on personal information gleaned from their environment, as opposed to obtaining information from conspecifics about predation risk."

Habitat type and group size are known to affect foraging and vigilance behaviors of the animals. We video-filmed and analyzed foraging, vigilance and moving behaviors of 127 focal Red Collared Doves (Streptopelia tranquebarica) in the western Taiwan to determine the effects of habitat types (open and obstructed) and group sizes (1 to 27 doves) on the behaviors. The results showed that the total foraging duration (sec) and number of pecking increased with the increase in group size at both habitats, while the total vigilance duration (sec), number of scanning bouts and scan duration were higher at the obstructed habitat than those at the open habitat. The group-size effect on vigilance was found only at the obstructed habitat but not at the open habitat. However, the low potential predation threats and possible use of peripheral vision to detect predators might dismiss the group-size effect. Also, the total moving duration (sec) decreased with the increase in group size, an indication of increasing foraging efficiency and anti-predatory benefits."

Distance to cover creates a gradient in predation risk that allows examining adjustments in anti-predator behaviour such as group size and vigilance.

I provide an empirical test of these predictions in staging semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) in a system controlling for many confounding factors that have marred earlier research. Controlling for food density, forager density and phenotypic attributes often correlated with distance to cover, I found that as distance to obstructive cover increased, sandpipers foraged in sparser groups, were less flighty and to some extent less vigilant. Such controlled studies are needed to re-assess the relationship between distance to cover and anti-predator behaviour."

Cows with calves were more than twice as vigilant (4.5% +/- 0.46%) as those without calves (2.0% +/- 0.27%). Single cattle and groups of two to five exhibited higher vigilance rates (4.2% +/- 0.79%) than groups of six to 20 (2.5% +/- 0.32%) and groups of > 20 (3.0% /- 0.41%). Cattle in groups of > 20 increased vigilance as visual obstruction increased. Mother cows whose calves were preyed upon (n = 5) exhibited a 3% to 48% increase in vigilance within 3 d after their calves were killed; this rate returned to near baseline levels after 10 d. Conversely, mother cows reduced foraging after their calves were killed from 88.5% +/- 1.69% to 43.5% +/- 11.4%; foraging rate also returned to near baseline levels after 10 d. Cattle exhibit vigilance at lower levels compared to wild ungulates, but this behavior appears to be at least partially an antipredatory behavior. Our findings provide support that predators can influence cattle behavior."

Juveniles generally perched higher in trees than adults and in areas with higher intensity of light, which may increase the difficulty of visually tracking prey. Juveniles allocated more effort to visual searching prior to a foraging attempt and flew farther than adults to capture a prey item. When at rest on a perch, juveniles monitored the environment more slowly than adults, suggesting lower levels of vigilance. In general, our results suggest that differences between ages in foraging behavior of visually guided predators may be influenced by intensity of ambient light in their foraging territories."

Small monospecific parties never exceeding 10 individuals were seen throughout the year, larger in winter on average. Males considerably outnumbered females within the groups. Adult flocks were frequent only in winter. In spring, many of the adult groups were mixed-sex assemblages composed of pairs plus supernumerary males. Sightings of juvenile groups, up to seven individuals, were common in summer???autumn. The vigilance role in mixed-sex assemblages, including pairs, appeared to be the responsibility of males based on sex-specific vigilance rates. The highest frequency of aggressive encounters, mainly male against male, occurred during the breeding season, associated with mate defence. Females attacked males, not the contrary, which supports reversed sexual dominance in bullfinches. Gregariousness probably acted as an anti-predatory and foraging strategy."
"Treves, A",Vigilance and use of micro-habitat in solitary rainforest mammals,MAMMALIA,61,511,525,,1997,"Solitary mammals are usually assumed to face greater danger than group-living mammals. This assumption has persisted untested because it is difficult to observe solitary animals and predation attempts on them. One way to circumvent this problem is to compare the vigilance and micro-site choice of solitaries to that of group residents, outside of predator encounters. Also, comparison of solitaries varying in body size may reveal differences in behavior due to variation in predator vulnerability, free of the potentially confounding effects of social defense. Vigilance and differences in the use of micro-habitats are studied in solitary individuals of five species (redtail monkeys, Cercopithecus ascanius, blue monkeys, C. mitis, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, black-and-white colobus, Colobus guereza and red duiker, Cephalophus sp.) observed at Kibale National Park, Uganda. Contrary to expectations, vigilance among the solitaries was not higher than that among group-residents. Redtail monkeys were the only species in which solitaries spent more time scanning than did group-residents, yet group-residents interrupted other activities to scan more often and monitored a greater area around them than solitaries did. However, use of micro-habitats was consistent with greater avoidance of predation risk among the solitaries. Body size of the solitaries correlated with time spent scanning, consistent with predator avoidance."

Nearly 90% of the distances recorded between paired males and females were within three meters. The degree of vigilance increased with distance apart for females, but not for males. The scanning rate of males was significantly, higher than that of females at <1 m and at 1-3 m respectively, but no significant difference occurred when the distance between them was >3 m. These results are discussed in relation to mate competition and wintering strategy; it is suggested that staving close together is the optimal strategy for members of Ruddy Shelduck pairs."
"Blumstein, DT",How much does social group size influence golden marmot vigilance?,BEHAVIOUR,133,1133,1151,10.1163/156853996X00332,1996,"A commonly cited benefit of group living is the ability for individuals to reduce the time devoted to scanning for predators with increasing group size - the 'group size effect'. Interestingly, most studies reporting a group size effect have focused on documenting a significant group size effect and did not discuss the relative 'importance' of group size. One way to study the relative importance of group size is to calculate the amount of variation in vigilance explained by group size. I studied effects of social group size on golden marmot (Marmota caudata aurea) vigilance in two ways. First, I estimated the overall amount of time marmots were vigilant during their morning active periods. Second, I estimated the amount of time marmots were vigilant specifically while foraging. Analyses statistically controlled for several factors that have been suggested to confound the study of group size effects. While marmots were active, only 14% of the variation in vigilance was explained by social group size. For foraging marmots, even less variation (about 6%) was explained by social group size. The amount of variation explained by social group size in golden marmots is considerably less that reported in several studies of other species where explained variation was reported or could be estimated from data. Some of the discrepancy between variation explained in this and other studies may stem from my focus on social group size which appears to explain less variation than the more commonly studied foraging aggregation size. However, species differ in the amount of time they devote to foraging and therefore vary in the magnitude of net benefit from group size effects. Future comparative work will be required to rigorously study the relationship between amount of time foraging and the magnitude of group size effects."

We evaluated behavioural characteristics of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), a keystone species, in the urban landscape of Denver, CO, USA. Specifically, we investigated the proportion of vigilance, foraging, and social behaviour within a system of urban colonies that varied in area, degree of connectivity, and time since isolation. Overall, rates of vigilance were lower than are typically reported for black-tailed prairie dogs in grassland habitats. Colonies that were more isolated exhibited higher levels of vigilance, but colonies isolated for a longer period of time exhibited reduced vigilance. Thus, while urban stimuli may increase alertness in the most isolated colonies, we suggest that black-tailed prairie dogs might eventually adjust to these stimuli and relax their vigilance responses. Because behaviour varies based on age of fragments, we provide evidence that black-tailed prairie dog populations are responding to urbanization through behavioural changes that may be adaptive. The ability to understand how landscape-level factors influence black-tailed prairie dog behaviour provides important information about the response of keystone species to urban settings and can aid conservation and management efforts in fragmented systems."

This has been widely interpreted as compensation for a reduced ability to detect approaching predators in obstructed habitats. We test the extent to which changes in vigilance may compensate for the effect of reduced visibility on an animal's ability to detect predators. We measured the vigilance, foraging and speed of predator-response behaviours of lone chaffinches Fringilla coelebs that fed on seeds (800 per m(2)) scattered on artificial stubble habitats (with either a clear view of surroundings or an obstructed view). On both treatments, individuals with more rapid head-up rates responded more quickly to a flying model sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus (P=0.04); as did individuals with shorter food-search times (P=0.02). However, neither head-up rate nor food-search period varied with obstruction. Based on research previously published using this system, we suggest that this is because individuals are constrained in their ability to increase head-up rate because doing so is largely determined by their individually determined foraging efficiency. Instead chaffinches increased the duration of their head-up periods by 13% in the visually obstructed treatment (long stubble) and peck rates were 13% lower. Despite this presumed attempt to compensate for reduced visibility, duration of head-up period had no effect on response time of the fast-moving predator in our experiment and birds were 24% slower to respond in the long stubble. Rather than being maladaptive, increasing head-up duration may have been related to enhanced detection of other predator types, for example stalkers. Our results have implications for the conservation of wild granivorous birds. They support the view that agroeconomic decisions that affect micro-habitat structure over a large scale could affect predation risk, habitat choice and the conservation status of granivorous birds."

Therefore, foraging Ruffs were filmed at four different salt ponds, with a final total of 681 film sequences being available for analysis. To test for effects of predictor variables on scan rate (number of scans per 30 s) of foraging Ruffs, generalised linear models (GLMs) were calculated including all variables and all possible subsets. Three variables remained in all 30 best GLMs (selected according to Akaike's information criterion) testing for effects on scan rate of foraging Ruffs: feeding location, feeding habitat and flock size. These variables also significantly affected Ruffs' scan rates according to Wald statistics. Besides differences of scan rates between feeding locations, the vigilance level was significantly higher in terrestrially foraging Ruffs than in birds feeding at semi-aquatic habitat patches. Furthermore, scan rate decreased with increasing flock size. Our study emphasized that, even when controlled for other variables affecting scan rates, flock size still remains important for explaining variance in vigilance levels of foraging Ruffs."

We assessed behavior of wild and pen-raised bobwhites foraging under risk of predation in a captive situation at the Tennessee Tech University Avian Research Facility, Cookeville, Tennessee, USA, during March-April 2008 and February-March 2009. We hypothesized wild bobwhites were more sensitive to predation risk than pen-raised bobwhites and evaluated the relative contributions of time allocation, vigilance, and foraging efficiency in avoiding predation among wild and pen-raised bobwhites. Coveys of 4 bobwhites were presented with 3 food patches at presumed safe, moderately risky, and risky distances from cover in 10-hr trials. Food consumption, vigilance, time allocation, foraging efficiency, and average realized covey size were measured using video recordings for each patch, and compared between wild and pen-raised bobwhites and among patch risk levels. Both wild and pen-raised bobwhites foraged more in safe patches than in riskier patches. Vigilance rates were similar between wild and pen-raised bobwhites. However, pen-raised bobwhites spent more time foraging at riskier patches than did wild bobwhites. Wild bobwhites foraged more efficiently than did pen-raised bobwhites, with foraging efficiency of wild bobwhites increasing in risky patches. Greater foraging efficiency and associated shorter foraging time among wild bobwhites may make them less susceptible to predation than pen-raised bobwhites. (C) 2016 The Wildlife Society."

We predicted that travel speed, pauses during locomotion, and vigilance would be greater in open (riskier) than in shrub (safer) habitats. Video recordings of marked individuals in the wild were used to measure speed and other variables of spontaneous locomotion not triggered by predatory attack or any other noticeable stimulus during nonforaging periods. Time spent vigilant while foraging was also measured. Because degus use bare-ground runways for distant movements (e.g., between burrow openings and/or food patches), data on locomotion decisions were not confounded by effects of obstructive vegetation cover and/or resource abundance. When moving across the habitat between different feeding places, degus showed an intermittent pattern of locomotion, interrupting running events with short pauses. As predicted, travel speed and the duration of pauses between locomotion bursts were significantly greater in open habitats. Further, the duration of locomotion bursts between feeding sites or between feeding sites and burrows was significantly longer in open habitats. Our assumption that pauses and velocities are independent decisions was supported by the lack of correlation between pauses and speeds during locomotion events. During foraging, degus devoted more time to vigilance in open than in shrub habitats. The static position adopted by degas during pauses, the speeds attained during movements, and the concordance between pausing behavior and vigilance across habitats suggest that pausing has an antipredatory role and is not limited to orientation and/or physiological recovery. Our results support the view that degus perceive higher predation risk in open areas and that flexible movement behavior reflects an adaptive antipredator response."
"Franklin, WE; Lima, SL",Laterality in avian vigilance: do sparrows have a favourite eye?,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,62,879,885,10.1006/anbe.2001.1826,2001,"Visual scanning for predators is one of a bird's most basic means of avoiding predation while feeding, and the detection of an approaching predator may present a difficult visual task. If birds have a dominant hemisphere for processing visual information, then given the nearly complete optic nerve crossover in the avian brain, the eye contralateral to that dominant hemisphere should be favoured in antipredatory vigilance. In short, vigilant birds should have a favourite eye. We conducted an experiment that examined laterality in eye use during the antipredatory scanning of wintering emberizid sparrows: dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, and American tree sparrows, Spizella arborea. Free-living birds were allowed to feed parallel to a visual obstruction, thereby forcing them to choose which eye to orient away from the visual obstruction and towards possible approaching predators. Juncos oriented themselves such that their right eye was oriented outward more than would be expected by chance. Tree sparrows had a marginally nonsignificant tendency to favour the left eye. The mechanics of the scanning process itself in these birds favoured one eye over the other. Both species turned their heads towards the visual obstruction when their preferred eye was facing away from the obstruction more often than would be expected by chance (right eye in juncos, left eye in tree sparrows); such behaviour allowed for a preferred-eye view of the area directly opposite protective cover. These results suggest that laterality exists in avian vigilance, and that laterality may differ even in closely related species. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Erect woody shrubs are increasing in many arctic and alpine environments, and this change in habitat structure has the potential to alter perception of risk and fear for foraging herbivores. To assess the role of shrub cover in determining behavioural responses to foraging under predation risk, we used measurements of giving-up density (GUD) and video recordings of vigilance behaviour of individual Arctic ground squirrels, Urocitellus parryii, across an alpine tundra to shrub ecotone. Dense shrub habitat was associated with higher GUDs, implying that foraging costs were higher in dense shrub than in less shrub-dominated habitats. Foraging strategies differed between habitats, with a negative relationship between visibility and GUD in high-visibility, open-tundra habitats and a positive relationship between visibility and GUD in low-visibility, shrub-dominated habitats, which may be indicative of alternative foraging strategies in different habitats. Squirrels initially made a high investment in vigilance, which was independent of patch residence time. This presumably increases the costs of quitting patches earlier. In shrub-dominated habitat, erect bipedal forms of vigilance were also observed more frequently. Our results indicate that shrub encroachment into northern and alpine tundra may impose costs on foraging arctic ground squirrels and alter foraging strategies.

We examined the individual antipredator behaviour of free-ranging thirteen-lined ground squirrels in 7 city parks in Lincoln, Nebraska, USA as they fed on peanut butter within small plexiglass boxes. Boxes differed in the position and amount of visual occlusion for a squirrel feeding in it: opaque, clear, opaque-sides, and opaque-top (also opaque on the end). We experimentally controlled environmental and contextual variables that have been identified as affecting vigilance behaviour. We filmed 38 ground squirrels as they fed in the boxes, and the results indicate that ground squirrels treat lateral occlusion as functionally identical to complete occlusion. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the squirrels' behaviours in the clear versus the opaque-top box. In 35 approach tests, a person walked toward individual ground squirrels as they foraged in one of the 4 box types. The distance at which the squirrels reacted did not differ among the 4 box types. The results of these two experiments suggest that thirteen-lined ground squirrels compensate for visual occlusion, primarily through increased withdrawals coupled with low-level vigilance postures and that the position of visual occlusion can be of greater importance than the absolute amount of occlusion."

Studies have shown that pronghorn antelope, Antilocapra americana (Ord, 1815), are influenced by human disturbances. We examined several intensities of human activity and distance from disturbances as indicators of risk perception in pronghorns. We investigated whether pronghorns exhibited risk-avoidance behaviour towards road traffic consistent with the risk-disturbance hypothesis by comparing vigilance and foraging behaviour observations across increasing traffic levels and proximity to roads. Pronghorns showed higher vigilance and lower foraging times along high traffic roads during the spring season compared with lower traffic levels, suggesting that risk perception is related to traffic level. Moreover, individuals within close proximity to roads regardless of traffic level exhibited higher vigilance levels, indicating that there is an overall risk perceived towards roads. Our results also suggest that individuals in herds with young are more risk averse than other social groupings and individuals in larger groups perceive less risk. We suggest that consequences of risk-avoidance behaviour should be reflected in land-use plans that address road densities and traffic levels to better manage wildlife."

We compared the behaviour of birds that foraged in pairs (mono- or hetero-specific) and solitarily. The percentage of time spent foraging was higher when a Great Tit was with an individual belonging to a subordinate species rather than with another Great Tit or a member of the dominant species. When a bird was solitary, time spent foraging was less than when it was with an individual belonging to a subordinate species, and greater than when it was with one belonging to the dominant species. The proportion of time spent vigilant did not differ between Great Tits that foraged with an individual from a dominant species or a subordinate species or with a conspecific, but was higher for solitary birds. Vigilance time of solitary Great Tits, Nuthatches, and three other Parus species was not negatively correlated with interspecific dominance status. In these small passerines, vigilance does not seem to be directed towards the detection of a competitor species. Surveillance for predators and detection of competitor species may be synchronous, nonexclusive tasks. Scanning rate (number of scans per minute of feeding) was the same for Great Tits that fed either solitarily or in pairs, but mean scan duration was significantly shorter for individuals in groups than when solitary. Individual Great Tits benefited from the presence of Coal, Blue, and Crested tits (subordinate Parus species), by a lengthening of the time spent at feeding patches and by conversion of vigilance time into feeding time."

An experimental approach (before-during-after design) was used to investigate the effects of disturbance by livestock and attending herder on the behaviour of the Himalayan marmot (Marmota himalayana)-a common burrowing animal. When disturbed by livestock and herder, marmots reduced their foraging activities and conversely increased vigilance levels. After livestock and herder had departed from a marmot colony, the marmots mostly returned to their normal behaviour; however, prolonged vigilance activity was observed. Marmots appear to have habituated to livestock and herder to some extent, but still responding to the livestock and herder by modifying their behaviour. Increased vigilance behaviour at the expense of foraging time may have potential consequences in terms of meeting energy budgets for winter hibernation. Therefore, future increases in livestock numbers could have a deleterious effect on marmots and other ground-dwelling wildlife in the region."

Hearing these calls, other group mates usually react by quickly changing their behaviour. Uttering alarm calls is an anti-predator mechanism with several possible functions. In this study our aim was to assess the function of alarm calls in the Arabian babbler Argya squamiceps, a cooperatively breeding songbird. We observed 10 groups in natural conditions and recorded 1000 reactions of 55 foraging group members to 268 sets of alarm calls uttered by the sentinels. The most frequent reaction of the group members to the sentinel's alarm calls was to stop foraging immediately, to fly up to the closest treetop and to start calling alarm calls. In all the recorded cases, the sentinel remained in place and continued to call. The alarm calls continued as long as the raptor could be seen, and then ceased gradually, after which babblers flew down and returned to foraging. We conclude that the main function of alarm calls in the Arabian babbler is pursuit deterrence. In particular, while foragers benefit from the information content of the sentinel's alarm calls and react on their basis, the raptor is the primary audience addressed by the calls uttered by the sentinel and the foragers who join it."

Anthropogenic noise, a ubiquitous form of human disturbance, has the potential to influence antipredator behaviour through its effects on predator detection and perceived risk. Noise might increase perceived risk as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis, reduce risk by providing protection from disturbance-sensitive predators, or have no effect on antipredator behaviour if animals are tolerant of nonlethal forms of human disturbance. Road traffic is a pervasive source of anthropogenic noise, but few studies have experimentally isolated the effects of road noise on behaviour. Using systematic playback experiments, we investigated the influence of traffic noise on foraging and vigilance in a keystone species in North American prairie systems, the prairie dog, Cynomys ludovicianus. Exposure to road traffic noise significantly lowered aboveground activity, reduced foraging and increased vigilance, as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis. These effects were prevalent irrespective of temperature, a strong influence on such behaviours, and they were consistent across the 3-month study period, providing no evidence of habituation. Our results provide the first experimental investigation of the potential costs of this ubiquitous disturbance in a free-ranging mammal, demonstrating that road noise can alter key survival behaviours of this ecologically pivotal species. These findings highlight that the presence of animals in a location is no guarantee of population and ecological integrity, while also underlining the potential synergistic impacts of noise on a species that has already experienced severe declines across its historic range due to human disturbance. Globally, roadways have profound impacts on biodiversity, and quantifying the behavioural and fitness costs associated with different forms of disturbance such as noise is crucial for mitigation.

O.; Sih, Andrew; Chivers, Douglas P.",The paradox of risk allocation: a review and prospectus,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,78,579,585,10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.05.034,2009,"Predation is one of the most important selection pressures acting on prey behaviour. While numerous studies have shown that when predation risk is high, prey tend to increase vigilance and reduce foraging effort, until recently, few studies have looked at how the temporal pattern of risk influences antipredator behaviour. The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that as predation risk fluctuates over time ( e. g. as predators come and go), the intensity of prey vigilance and foraging should depend on both the level of risk and the proportion of time that predators are present. If predators are usually absent, prey can meet their energy demands during safe periods, and thus respond strongly during the rare times when predators are present. In contrast, if predators are almost always present, prey might need to forage actively even though predators are present, a counterintuitive prediction for many behavioural ecologists. In this review, we present and highlight the paradoxical nature of the risk allocation model. We then review studies that empirically tested the model. These studies provide only mixed support for the model. Importantly, we identify factors that help to explain why some studies supported the model and others did not. In particular, we find that studies that gave prey more time to assess and learn the risk regime had a higher probability of yielding results that supported the model. Finally, we suggest extensions of the model framework to incorporate broader and more complex ecological contexts. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

"Pascual, Jordi; Senar, Joan Carles",Antipredator behavioural compensation of proactive personality trait in male Eurasian siskins,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,90,297,303,10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.02.002,2014,"Many animals show behavioural syndromes (i.e. suites of correlated behaviours across multiple situations). These behavioural correlations, however, imply limitations in the behavioural plasticity of individuals when facing the trade-off between predation risk and starvation risk. Some models suggest that proactive animals prioritize the reduction of starvation risk, while reactive animals do the opposite. Therefore, fast explorers that are also bold (i.e. proactive) are assumed to pay a predation cost associated with their behavioural trait. However, it has recently been suggested that proactive individuals may be able to compensate for their higher risk of predation by adopting some antipredator behaviours. In this study we tested these two alternative hypotheses with wild wintering Eurasian siskins, Carduelis spinus, foraging at artificial feeders. Male siskins have a melanin-based black bib that has been found to be correlated with exploratory behaviour, aggressiveness and dominance, and therefore is a signal of pro-activity. We found that male siskins with large black bibs uttered more distress calls upon capture and displayed a vigilance strategy that improved predator detection. Moreover, this vigilance strategy did not reduce food intake rate. These results show that proactive individuals are not reckless, but instead compensate for their personality trait with stronger antipredator behaviours, and thus, do not necessarily have to pay a predation cost. Our results support the view of a positive relationship between eumelanism, proactive personality and the display of antipredator behaviours.

"Putman, Breanna J.; Clark, Rulon W.",The fear of unseen predators: ground squirrel tail flagging in the absence of snakes signals vigilance,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,26,185,193,10.1093/beheco/aru176,2015,"Rather than fleeing from predators, many animals exhibit conspicuous displays that are thought to deter attacks by advertising quality (physical capabilities), or awareness of the predator. However, prey commonly exhibit the same antipredator display when predators are absent. Signaling in this context could either dishonestly indicate predator detection, or honestly indicate vigilance, but no study has tested these hypotheses experimentally. We tested the vigilance advertisement function of tail flagging, a signal given by California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi) to rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus), by simulating snake strikes and quantifying strike avoidance behaviors in signaling and non-signaling squirrels. We removed the effect of snake presence on signaling by simulating strikes 1) in the presence of a rattlesnake, 2) with no snake present, or 3) in an area where squirrels had recently encountered a snake that was no longer present. Squirrels tail flagged most when interacting with a snake. Squirrels also signaled in areas of recent snake encounters, and in this context, they responded faster to simulated strikes and were more likely to leap vertically or horizontally away from the attack. Tail flagging rate was also related to squirrels' body displacement time and flee modality. Squirrels rarely signaled or exhibited evasive leaping with no snake present. These results indicate that displays in the absence of predators can honestly signal vigilance, or the readiness to avoid an attack, even if predators are undetected. Such antipredator displays may be widespread as many species could benefit from advertising alertness when uncertain of the location of predators."

Research took place in a large-scale forest restoration experiment where habitat patches of different sizes were planted. I examined the effects of predator vocalizations (direct cues) on the vigilance behavior of Cherrie's Tanagers (Ramphocelus costaricensis) foraging in three different locations with varying amounts of vegetation cover (indirect cues): small patches and the centers and edges of large patches. Results show that the indirect cue of predation risk mediated birds' response to the direct cue. The increase in time birds spent alert in response to the predator call was significantly greater in the presumably riskier small patches and large patch edges compared to the relatively safe large patch centers. The increase in frequency of head-turns also was significantly greater in small patches compared to the large patch centers in response to the predator call. Although birds recognized the threat of the predator call and reacted by fleeing more quickly than after the non-predator call, this response did not differ between locations. Birds appeared to integrate information from both types of cues to evaluate their predation risk and determine their vigilance response. Individuals responded more strongly to the direct cue of predation risk when foraging in the presumably riskier smaller patches and large patch edges by increasing vigilance. These results highlight the importance of investigating behavioral responses to the characteristics of forest restoration sites, many of which consist of small patches of habitat."

These effects are rarely explicitly investigated, often due to the assumption that the study animal is habituated to or unaffected by a human's presence. We investigated the effect of human pressure gradients on a remote population of large-headed capuchins, Sapajus macrocephalus, looking specifically at the effects of number of observers, distance to observers, and distance to the research base. We conducted this study over 4 months in the Pacaya-Samiria Nature Reserve, Peru, and collected 199 two-minute focal samples of capuchin behavior. We found that capuchin monkeys fed less when human observers were closer to the focal individual, when more observers were present, and when capuchins were closer to the research base. We found no other consistent differences in capuchin monkey behavior across the measured human pressure gradients, although capuchins directed a high proportion of their vigilance toward humans (29% in adults and 47% in infants). Our results support the hypothesis that human pressure gradients influence animal behavior. Given the proportion of human directed vigilance, we recommend that all studies that use human observers to record animal behavior consider human-directed vigilance, record the number of observers, as well as the observer-focal animal distance, to check for these effects."

Justin; Long, Jed A.",Red deer behavioural response to hiking activity: A study using camera traps,JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,,,,10.1111/jzo.12976,2022,"With increasing levels of outdoor recreation activities, consequences for wildlife through interactions with recreationists are highly variable. Behavioural changes in wildlife are one potential consequence of interactions with outdoor recreationists. In ungulate populations, vigilance and flight responses are well-known antipredator behaviours, and an increase in their level indicates a more intense stress level which, ultimately, can have consequences for animal fitness. In Scotland, the geographical distribution of red deer (Cervus elaphus) overlaps greatly with areas used for popular outdoor activities such as hill walking. In this piece of research, we studied red deer time allocation, vigilance, and flight behaviours near a popular hiking path using camera traps. We positioned the cameras in transects at different distances (25, 75, and 150 m) from the path and recorded hiking activity using an automated people counter. Red deer behaviour was categorized from photo analysis as (1) no response (e.g. feeding and resting), (2) vigilant (i.e. upright head position), and (3) flight response. We also investigated demographic variables (group size and sex) and the direction of red deer movement relative to the trail. We used generalised linear mixed models to analyse behaviour in relation to the distance from the hiking track, hiking activity, time of the day, demographic, and environmental variables. We did not find an increase in vigilance or flight behaviour in relation to the distance from the hiking path or the hiking activity. These results suggest that red deer, in our study area, are habituated to the presence of hikers and may spatially avoid areas close to the hiking path instead of displaying cost-intensive behaviour (i.e. flight or vigilance behaviour)."
"Van der Veen, IT",Daily routines and predator encounters in Yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella in the field during winter,IBIS,142,413,420,,2000,"Diurnal and seasonal variation in foraging behaviour of Yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella and activity of their avian predators were studied in an unmanipulated winter field situation around Uppsala, Sweden. In December, when time available for foraging was lowest, Yellowhammers seemed to be time-stressed. In order to meet their energetic needs, they reduced the time allocated to vigilance and increased the time allocated to foraging. Yellowhammers did not systematically change the time spent foraging during the day in December, which indicates time-stress, while they decreased the time spent foraging during the day in both November and February. Predator activity was highest in the afternoon, when Yellowhammers spent the least time foraging. Yellowhammers may have adopted a routine with decreasing foraging rates over the day in November and February, when time available for foraging was longer, in order to avoid foraging during periods of high predator activity. The diurnal activity pattern of predators together with daylength and energetic needs are factors that might be important in shaping daily foraging routines in small birds."
"Ostreiher, Roni; Heifetz, Aviad",The sentineling-Foraging trade-off in dominant and subordinate Arabian babblers,ETHOLOGY,125,98,105,10.1111/eth.12833,2019,"Many cooperative breeders forage under predation risks, sentineling is a central activity, and groupmates have to balance between sentineling and foraging. The optimal balance between sentinel activity and foraging may differ among dominant and subordinate individuals, as dominants are more efficient foragers. Two theoretical models pertain to this balance and predict when individuals with different foraging abilities should switch between the two activities on the basis of their energetic state. In one of these models, individuals must attain a critical energetic level by dusk to pass the night, and in the second model fitness is monotonically increasing with the energetic state. We tested these models in the cooperatively breeding Arabian babbler, Turdoides squamiceps. We measured the length of sentinel bouts and the gaps between them both in natural conditions and following experimental feeding. Following feeding ad libitum, subordinates expanded their sentinel bouts significantly more than dominants in comparison with natural conditions. These findings are consistent with the first model, but not with the second. In the experiment, we measured the mass of mealworms consumed by each individual following a sentinel bout relative to its body mass. This ratio was larger for subordinates, indicating that they ended their sentinel bouts at a lower energetic state than dominants. This finding is consistent with the second model, but not with the first. Immediately after eating ad libitum, in 62% of the cases the first behavior performed by the babblers was a new sentinel bout, but in 17% it was a mutual interaction with a groupmate, indicating that social interactions also play a role in the trade-off vis-a-vis sentinel activity."

We investigated foraging site selection by chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, between a 'safe' patch with short stubble allowing earlier detection of an approaching predator and a 'risky' patch with longer, more visually obstructive stubble. When initial seed densities in the patches were equal, individuals foraged more in the short stubble and had shorter vigilance periods than those that foraged in the long stubble. These differences in foraging and vigilance behaviour changed if the food abundance in each patch was unequal. We used these variations in measures of foraging and vigilance behaviour to predict the level of increased food abundance in the 'risky' patch necessary for it to be used more often. As the relative density of seeds in the long stubble compared to that in the short stubble increased, the proportion of time individuals spent in the short stubble declined. Patch switching occurred at a seed density ratio of approximately 1:2.5. Individuals made a higher proportion of pecks in the short stubble with less than two times as many seeds in the long stubble. With more than three times as many seeds in the long stubble, they made a higher proportion of pecks in the long stubble. The results show that compensation through vigilance for the increased predation risk manifest in a patch's physical characteristics may greatly reduce the profitability of a patch."
"Russila, Vesa; Poysa, Hannu",Shared and unshared parental investment in the precocial goldeneye (Aves: Anatidae),Animal Behaviour,55,307,312,,1998,"Lazarus and Inglis (Anim. Behav., 1986, 34, 1791-1804) introduced a model of the influence of brood size on the optimal level of parental investment and parent-offspring conflict and drew a distinction between shared and unshared types of parental investment. With respect to this division, we measured the parental costs in the goldeneye, Bucephala clangula, a precocial species with uniparental female care, in terms of time spent in vigilance and intraspecific aggression. We also compared levels of anti-predator vigilance and intraspecific aggression between females with and without broods. Females with broods spent considerably more time on both vigilance and intraspecific aggression, but anti-predator vigilance was independent of brood size. Furthermore, female behaviour was unaffected by brood reduction. Both these observations support the 'fixed-loss' model of unshared care, where the level of parental investment is predicted to be independent of brood size, since the predator is likely to take only a single offspring. In contrast, intraspecific aggression, mainly associated with defence of the brood's feeding area, increased with brood size. This supports the 'shared care' model where the level of parental investment increases with brood size, a type of care usually associated with altricial species."

Conversely, communication calls of other species might indicate the perceived absence of a predator and hence allow a reduction in vigilance. This eavesdropping was demonstrated in birds and mammals, including lemur species. Interspecific communication between taxonomic groups has so far been reported in some reptiles and mammals, including three primate species. So far, neither semantic nor interspecific communication has been tested in a solitary and nocturnal lemur species. The aim of this study was to investigate if the nocturnal and solitary Sahamalaza sportive lemur, Lepilemur sahamalazensis, is able to access semantic information of sympatric species. During the day, this species faces the risk of falling prey to aerial and terrestrial predators and therefore shows high levels of vigilance. We presented alarm calls of the crested coua, the Madagascar magpie-robin and aerial, terrestrial and agitation alarm calls of the blue-eyed black lemur to 19 individual Sahamalaza sportive lemurs resting in tree holes. Songs of both bird species' and contact calls of the blue-eyed black lemur were used as a control. After alarm calls of crested coua, Madagascar magpierobin and aerial alarm of the blue-eyed black lemur, the lemurs scanned up and their vigilance increased significantly. After presentation of terrestrial alarm and agitation calls of the blue-eyed black lemur, the animals did not show significant changes in scanning direction or in the duration of vigilance. Sportive lemur vigilance decreased after playbacks of songs of the bird species and contact calls of blue-eyed black lemurs. Our results indicate that the Sahamalaza sportive lemur is capable of using information on predator presence as well as predator type of different sympatric species, using their referential signals to detect predators early, and that the lemurs' reactions are based on experience and learning."

Together with grazing, vigilance behaviour is a fundamental Dart of the complex of animal feeding behaviours. The aim of the study was to determine which factors can significantly affect the number of vigilant animals in a group. I tested the dependence of vigilance number upon group size and time of day. I formed that in roe deer there is a group size at which the safety of all its members is secured by a minimum number of vigilant animals. In the series tested, the herd size varied between 40 and 60 head. In this context, a hypothesis was presented concerning the optimum group size."

Over a 5-year period, we studied the crepuscular activities of 13 individual zebras within a focal group held within a managed game reserve. We also examined individual residency within the group by recording births, mortalities and longevity of group membership by adults. Residency of individuals living in other groups on the reserve was similarly monitored to examine variability in social structure within this closed population over an extended period of time. Stable, female groups were the mainstay of group sociality with male mean residency at 31.6 months being variable in length or even absent. Social interactions across all categories of zebras were free from aggression. Despite an absence of non-human predators, the proportion of dusk time budget allocated to vigilance was high, at 41% for males during periods when they accompanied stable female groups and 12% for females during these same periods. Female vigilance increased significantly to 19% when males were not resident. Females spent 70% of the time grazing and males just 36%. Due to its long-term nature, we concluded this study established a base line for plains zebra activity that could assist in understanding the factors that influence the successful management and conservation of healthy populations."

Stalking predators, however, increase their chance of attack success by preferentially targeting nonvigilant individuals, potentially making relative vigilance rates in a group relatively important in determining predation compared with the dilution effect. Many predators, however, attack opportunistically without stalking, when targeting of nonvigilant individuals may be less likely, so that the dilution effect will then be a relatively more important antipredation reason for grouping. We tested whether an opportunistically hunting predator, the sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, preferentially attacked vigilant or feeding prey models presented in pairs. We found that sparrowhawks attacked vigilant and feeding mounts at similar frequencies. Our results suggest that individuals should prioritize maximizing group size or individual vigilance dependent on the type of predator from which they are at risk. When the most likely predator is a stalker, individuals should aim to have the highest vigilance levels in a group, and there may be relatively little selective advantage to being in the largest group. In contrast, if the most likely predator is an opportunist, then individuals should simply aim to be in the largest group and can also spend more time foraging without compromising predation risk. For most natural systems this will mean a trade-off between the two strategies dependent on the frequency of attack of each predator type. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We tested whether the strength of selection for flock size in redshanks, Tringa totanus, depended on hunting mode used by sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, and peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus. Sparrowhawks prefer to ambush prey from cover, whereas peregrines normally attack from the open and use aerial pursuit. The success rate of surprise attacks should always decline with group size because of vigilance effects, and so should be similar for both predators. The success rate of nonsurprise attacks should decline with group size for peregrines because confusion effects apply, but not necessarily for sparrowhawks which quickly give up their chase. Consequently, peregrines should be more likely to attack smaller flocks than sparrowhawks to minimize confusion. Observations of 895 attacks, including 120 captures, confirmed these predictions. The decline in success rate with group size was the same for both predators for surprise attacks but was seen only for peregrines for nonsurprise attacks. Sparrowhawks attacked larger flocks than peregrines, although both species attacked small flocks with similar frequency. Our results suggest that the selective benefits of group size depend both on predator type and hunting mode, we assume because of variation in the importance of vigilance and confusion, and on relative predator abundance. Changes in prey group size may then change the strength of selection on vigilance and confusion effects by altering the relative attack frequency by different predators.

Prey have been shown to be more visible in sunlit than in shaded patches, leading to higher predation risk and more investment in vigilance (predation risk hypothesis). Additionally, prey have been hypothesized to take longer to detect predators in sunlit compared to shaded patches because of the excess of sunlight causing glare effects (disability glare hypothesis). We tested the predictions of these two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses in a seminatural experiment with brown-headed cowbirds by measuring vigilance behavior and detection of a ground predator in patches under the shade of vegetation and in the open. Light intensity and achromatic contrast were higher in the sunlit patches, which could enhance glare effects, but chromatic contrast was higher in the shaded patches. Brown-headed cowbirds took longer to show alert reactions to and flee from a ground predator in sunlit compared to shaded patches. However, the two parameters associated with perceived predation risk (vigilance prior to the predator exposure and time to resume foraging after the attack) did not differ between sunlit and shaded patches. Our findings support to a greater extent the disability glare hypothesis than the predation risk hypothesis. Overall, ambient light conditions can affect two critical components of behavioral predatorprey interactions in terrestrial habitats: detection of and escape from predators. The effects of disability glare are expected to be more pronounced in bird species with wider visual fields or without sun-shading structures; however, species may compensate through various behaviors (e.g. avoidance of sunlit patches and changes in head orientation)."
"Hogstad, Olav",Rank-related response in foraging site selection and vigilance behaviour of a small passerine to different winter weather conditions,ORNIS FENNICA,92,53,62,,2015,"The foraging patterns and time spent on vigilance behaviour by Willow Tits (Poecile montanus) were studied under varying weather conditions in a subalpine forest in central Norway during the winters of 2009-2013. The birds adjusted their microhabitat use in pines and their vigilance levels in response to perceived risk of predation and starvation. At low temperatures, the dominating adults foraged mainly in the upper and most predation safe areas in pines and the subordinate juveniles in the more predator risky lower halves. When the outer canopies of pines were covered by snow, the adults tended to restrict their foraging activities to the inner parts of the lower halves of the trees and thus overlapped considerably with the juveniles. In windy weather, the age classes differed in site use, mostly because juveniles foraged more in the outer part of the branches. Juveniles were significantly More vigilant than adults under all the weather conditions, and they spent about 60% of their time seeking food whereas adults spent about 85%. It is suggested that the high level of vigilance by the subordinate juveniles is costly and may be the main cause of the higher winter mortality of juveniles compared to that of adults."

The lethal effect of apex predators on mesopredators is well documented, but they also could affect mesopredators in non-lethal ways. We investigated foraging decisions and perceived risk in the bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis), a small canid that is often killed by larger terrestrial carnivores and birds of prey. We used giving-updensity (GUD) experiments and observations of vigilance behavior to assess the influence of temporal, spatial, and anthropogenic factors on perceived risk in a population of bat-eared foxes at the Kuruman River Reserve, Northern Cape, South Africa. GUDs were higher during periods around the new moon and lower in the presence of researchers, suggesting that foxes are warier in darker conditions, but perceive an increase in relative safety in the presence of humans. Vigilance, however, did not vary with these same factors. Observational data revealed foraging success outside the experimental context did not differ with lunar period, implying that higher GUDs associated with new moons were not due to higher missed opportunity costs associated with foraging at patches. These results suggest that GUDs may be capable of detecting more subtle differences in perceived risk when compared to vigilance rates. We highlight the important considerations of using GUDs to examine perceived risk for a predatory species and emphasize that future studies using GUDs should quantify predators' risk-related decisions by documenting missed opportunity costs to determine the implications behind patch-use behavior."

A large-scale synthesis,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,78,337,347,10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.05.008,2009,"Mixed-species flocks of foraging birds have been documented from terrestrial habitats all over the world and are thought to form for either improved feeding efficiency or better protection from predators. Two kinds of flock participants are recognized: those that join other species ('followers') and are therefore likely to be the recipients of the benefits of flock participation and those that are joined ('leaders'). Through comparative analyses, using a large sample of flocks from around the world, we show that (1) 'followers' tend to be smaller, more insectivorous, and feed in higher strata than matched species that participate in flocks to a lesser extent and (2) 'leaders' tend to be cooperative breeders more often than matched species that are not known to lead flocks. Furthermore, meta-analyses of published results from across the world showed that bird species in terrestrial mixed-species flocks increase foraging rates and reduce vigilance compared to when they are solitary or in conspecific groups. Moreover, the increase in foraging rates is seen only with flock followers and not flock leaders. These findings suggest a role for predation in the evolution of mixed-species flocking. Species that are vulnerable to predation follow species whose vigilance they can exploit. By doing so, they are able to reduce their own vigilance and forage at higher rates.

Participants in the bergamot condition detected fewer targets correctly within 1.25 seconds of the target appearing than did those in the peppermint or no-odour groups. Exposure to bergamot was also associated with significantly fewer correct detections in the second than in the first half of the task, when compared with the other two conditions. The results suggest that sustained exposure to a relaxing odour can impair visual vigilance. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

This increased safety could be exchanged against a reduced individual vigilance leading to increased foraging and fitness until costs of intra-group competition offset this benefit. However, very few studies have been able to directly test the relationship between individual fitness and group size in non-cooperative breeding species. Therefore, evidence that dilution and detection effects do indeed translate into increased fitness under predation risk remains mostly theoretical. Here, we aimed at empirically testing whether group size influences beneficial and costly behaviors, and ultimately the survival of individuals, in a prey species facing heavy predation pressure. We focused on plains zebra Equus quagga of Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe, a high lion density area. We collected behavioral data (i.e., individual vigilance and foraging, collective vigilance, and agonistic interactions) that we used as proxies to investigate the costs and benefits of grouping in this species. We then fitted multistate capture-mark-recapture and Cox proportional-hazards models to estimate apparent survival of adults and young zebras, respectively, and assess whether a demographic signal of group size could be found. Our results show that collective vigilance increases with group size, a prerequisite of the detection effect, but individual vigilance does not consistently decrease with group size, which suggests that there is no group size effect on individual vigilance. Agonistic interactions were rare. These results suggest that there are no foraging costs of grouping here, and even some benefits such as a better collective vigilance. However, any benefits of being in larger groups did not translate into increased survival, as we found no effect of group size on the apparent survival of individuals. Since dilution and detection effects do not matter behaviorally and demographically in these plains zebras living under high predation risk, these results challenge our understanding of how predation shapes animal sociality: fitness benefits of dilution or detection should not be assumed."

Such encounters, even when they don't pose a direct threat to wildlife, may induce behavioral changes in animals that in the long run may have negative fitness consequences. We studied changes to the vigilance/group-size effect in Nubian ibex Capra nubiana in response to increased non-threatening anthropogenic disturbance in six sites, subject to different levels of ecotourism. In each site we regressed the average time ibex individuals devoted to vigilance on the size of the group they were with. We then compared the slopes and intercepts of the vigilance/group-size function between the six sites. We complimented these data with a study of how flight initiation distance (FID) changed between the six sites, as an indicator of the level of tolerance that ibex exhibit to increased anthropogenic presence. We found that as anthropogenic presence increased the vigilance/group-size function waned (i.e. the group-size effect was weaker). These findings were associated with reduced FID reflecting increased levels of tolerance, likely as a result of habituation in sites subject to high levels of ecotourism. The loss of the vigilance response as a function of group size may decrease the behavioral diversity in the ibex population. Wildlife habituation to increased non-threatening human activity alters key behavioral attributes that may ultimately impact social structure and other fitness-related characteristics."

In sexually dichromatic birds, differential conspicuousness between the sexes may result in differences in vigilance for predators. Aspects of the predator avoidance and foraging enhancement hypotheses for the selective value of joining a mixed-species flock were assessed for the strongly sexually dichromatic Hawaii akepa (Loxops coccineus coccineus). There was support for the primary predictions of the predator avoidance hypothesis: vigilance levels decreased with increasing group size, and with membership in a flock, but only for brightly colored adult males. There was little support for the hypothesis that the primary benefit of joining a mixed-species flock is to enhance foraging efficiency through local enhancement."

Despite living in isolation from most predators for up to 7000 years, quokkas exhibited typical group size effects of aggregation: they foraged more and showed less visual vigilance as group size increased. Group size effects, therefore, may result from factors other than antipredator benefits. In groups larger than 10, quokkas, uniquely among macropodids, allocated virtually all of their time to foraging and none to looking. Given virtually no predation risk on Rottnest Island and no antipredator benefit from aggregation, competition for food or other resources may also be important factors influencing time allocation in quokkas. Quokkas seemingly retained some apparent antipredator behaviour: they remained sensitive to the distance they were from cover and to the time of day when allocating time to foraging and looking."

White-crowned sparrows fed at an artificial food patch in small flocks both in single-species flocks and with towhees. Mean per capita scan durations of white-crowned sparrows in single-species flocks declined significantly with increasing group size (i.e., they exhibited the group-size effect). Scan durations did not decline as flock size increased, however, when a single California towhee fed with the white-crowned sparrows, such that the group-size effect was not apparent. These results add to the growing list of cases suggesting that individuals are vigilant not solely to acquire information about predators; in this case, individual white-crowned sparrows, when feeding with a large heterospecific, appear also to attempt to acquire information about a potential aggressor while scanning their surroundings."

The risk-disturbance hypothesis predicts that animals exhibit risk-avoidance behaviours when exposed to human disturbance because they perceive the disturbance as a predatory threat.Aims. This study aimed to examine whether Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsoni) exhibit risk-avoidance behaviour with proximity to a major highway and with increasing traffic flow consistent with the risk-disturbance hypothesis.Methods. Focal-animal sampling was used to observe the behaviour of Tibetan antelopes. The behaviours were categorised as foraging, vigilance, resting, moving, or other. The time, frequency, and duration of foraging and vigilance were calculated.Key results. As distance from the road increased, time spent foraging and foraging duration increased while foraging frequency, time spent being vigilant and vigilance frequency decreased, indicating that there is a risk perception associated with roads. Tibetan antelopes presented more risk-avoidance behaviours during high-traffic periods compared with low-traffic periods.Conclusions. Tibetan antelopes exhibited risk-avoidance behaviour towards roads that varied with proximity and traffic levels, which is consistent with the risk-disturbance hypothesis.Implications. The consequences of risk-avoidance behaviour should be reflected in wildlife management by considering human disturbance and road design."

For all the examined series, the serial patterns were similar. However, the temporal patterns vary strongly among individuals and depend upon the number of conspecifics present. These results support the assumption of the existence of general behavioral processes, presumably involving self-sustaining endogenous oscillators."

We predicted that deer would spend less time foraging, have higher giving-up densities of food (GUDs), and have higher vigilance behavior when occupying patch edges than when in open and forest interiors. We also measured GUDs in 3 microhabitats within 3 forest types. We used pellet-group surveys to estimate habitat and microhabitat use, and we assessed vigilance behavior with automatic camera systems. The GUDs (perceived predation risk) were greater in forests of Douglas fir (Pseudostuga menziensii) than mountain tain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius). In forests of Douglas fir, GUDs were greatest in the forest interior, declined at the forest edge, and were lowest in the open microhabitat. Microhabitat features did not influence GUDs in the mountain mahogany forest. Pellet-group data indicated more activity in the open than in the edge or forest. Based on photographs, deer were more vigilant at forest edges than in open and forest areas. We concluded that deer are responding to predation risk, by biasing their feeding efforts Ls at the scale of habitats and microhabitats and altering their habitat-specific patterns of vigilance behavior."

These trade-offs may be influenced by differences in vegetative cover, especially if foraging profitability and predation risk differ among habitats. We examined above-ground activity of Townsend's ground squirrels (Spermophilus townsendii) in four habitats in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southwestern Idaho to determine if behavior of ground squirrels varied among habitats, and we assessed factors that might affect perceived predation risk (i.e. predator detectability, predation pres sure, population density). The proportion of time spent in vigilance by ground squirrels in winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata) and mosaic habitats of winterfat-sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) was more than twice that of ground squirrels in burned and unburned sagebrush habitats. We found no evidence for the many-eyes hypothesis as an explanation for differences in vigilance among habitats. Instead, environmental heterogeneity, especially vegetation structure, likely influenced activity budgets of ground squirrels. Differences in vigilance may have been caused by differences in predator detectability and refuge availability, because ground squirrels in the winterfat and mosaic habitats also spent more time in upright vigilant postures than ground squirrels in burned-sagebrush or sagebrush habitats. Such postures may enhance predator detection in low-growing winterfat."

An application is proposed at two study sites in Europe-in Spain and in Italy-with two climatic contexts (semiarid and humid, respectively), with the objective of proving the essential role of multi-site training for a robust application of the proposed methodologies. Several classifiers are proposed to separate irrigated and rainfed areas. They are based on statistical variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series data at the agricultural field scale, as well as on the contrasted behavior between the field scale and the 5 km surroundings. The support vector machine (SVM) classification approach was tested with different options to evaluate the robustness of the proposed methodologies. The optimal number of metrics found is five. These metrics illustrate the importance of optical/radar synergy and the consideration of multi-scale spatial information. The highest accuracy of the classifications, approximately equal to 85%, is based on training dataset with mixed reference fields from the two study sites. In addition, the accuracy is consistent at the two study sites. These results confirm the potential of the proposed approaches towards the most general use on sites with different climatic and agricultural contexts."

Here we used data from two wild vervet monkey, Chlorocebus pygerythru,s groups to assess whether the detection of predators affected their subsequent behaviour to the detriment of their short-term foraging effort. Encounters with the three predator classes present at our study site were frequent and there was evidence that animals were more likely to shift to predatorfocused vigilance, which was modulated by alarm call intensity, but not predator type, in the hour following detection. Nevertheless, and against expectation, there was no detectable shift in overall levels of vigilance, which remained low, interindividual distances, travel bearing and, consequently, effort put into foraging. We consider this surprising imperturbability by our study groups in the context of population group size, as our groups are large and have correspondingly lower levels of individual vigilance, as well as in terms of the constraints imposed by small, overlapping territories and frequent predator encounters. Finally, we advocate for increased consideration of the responses of the predators themselves to detection by their prey. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Disturbance associated with pastoralism can influence the behaviour of wild animals; hence, it is important to better understand its effects on wild animal behaviour. We compared the activity budget of the Himalayan marmot (Marmota himalayana) between areas experiencing both high and low levels of pastoralism, in the Upper Mustang region in Nepal. Scan sampling was used to collect diurnal activity budget data on adult marmots, whereas 2 min focal observations were made on foraging marmots to assess vigilance during foraging. Contrary to our prediction, there was no significant difference between areas of high and low pastoralism in terms of foraging behaviour. However, the vigilance activity of marmots was significantly influenced by the extent of disturbances associated with pastoralism. Marmots scanned the surroundings more often while foraging and spent more time scanning in high pastoralism sites as compared to marmots in low pastoralism sites. Although we found no direct negative effects of pastoralism on foraging time, marmots shifted the time of day when they foraged. This study suggests that marmots adjust their vigilance behaviour according to the environmental conditions in which they occur. These findings have important implications for the conservation of marmots in the wake of increasing pastoral activities and consequent increases in human-wildlife conflict in Nepal."

Group size effects can result from a reduction in predation risk or from an increase in competition as a function of aggregation. Anti-predator models of vigilance and foraging group size effects both predict a non-linear relationship between group size and time allocation. Linear relationships between group size and time allocation may reflect the modification of such relationships by intraspecific interference competition for limited resources, which would reveal a fundamental cost of sociality. We studied the degree to which group size effects in the yellow-footed rock-wallaby (Petrogale xanthopus, a macropodid marsupial) were non-linear. Like several other macropods, yellow-footed rock-wallabies foraged more and looked less as group size increased. Variation in vigilance was best explained by the number of conspecifics within 10 m-a distance substantially less than the 30-50 in often used to quantify group size in macropodids. Linear regressions explained more variation than non-linear ones, suggesting that wallabies traded-off the benefits of aggregation with the costs of competition. Moreover, dominant yellow-foots looked less and tended to forage more than subordinate animals. We hypothesize that competition may be relatively more important in the life-histories of yellow-footed rock-wallabies than those of other macropodid marsupials."

To test whether this reaction was species specific, a playback experiment was conducted using jay calls, a native passerine and three exotic passerines, and responses of the owls to the recordings were measured. The results indicated that the owls responded with increased vigilance only to calls of the Curl-crested Jay. It is hypothesized that the interaction between the two species may be related to competition for dietary resources initiating a greater aggressive response in the diurnal jay due to its more limited foraging time, compared to the nocturnal and diurnal owls. The vigilant response of the owls may thus be related to avoidance of potentially costly aggressive interactions with jays."

Though the sentinel duty was shared by other members of the group, the breeding birds and other older birds acted more often as sentinels and for a longer duration. It is speculated that allopreening in the whiteheaded babbler helps to reduce aggression and promote group integration. This babbler roosts communally. The groups of whiteheaded babblers appear to be organised hierarchically. Calls appear to have a definite function in the species. Clumping, allopreening, sentinel system and the large repertoire of vocalizations may be helpful in consolidating the group and co-ordinating its movements."

Chucks are included in calls of both males and females and increase in prevalence with the proximity of the caller to the alarm-evoking stimulus. Furthermore, chuck presence is not independent of primary syllable type: chucks follow primary syllables that have constant frequency and diminishing amplitude ('whistle'), but do not trail primary syllables with diminishing frequency and nondescending amplitude spectra ('chirps'). Playbacks to free-living squirrels of repeated alarm calls having whistle- or chirp-like primary syllables factorially combined with chuck presence or absence revealed that chirp-like syllables elicited greater vigilance from call recipients during signal propagation. The addition of chucks to the end of primary syllables of either type, however, increased initial vigilance duration and the proportion of time devoted to vigilance during and after signal reception. Chucks thus promote increased and lasting vigilance on the part of call recipients. Beyond enhancing vigilance, however, the inclusion of frequency-modulated chucks and chirps facilitates the orientation of receivers to the signaller. Multiple acoustic parameters of Richardson's ground squirrel alarm vocalizations thus interact to communicate information regarding several aspects of a predator encounter. Receivers use this information to their advantage, affording greater attention to calls that would be more readily located by predators, and hence are more costly for signallers to produce.

This description is often based on the assumption that ground squirrels require clear views to promote detection of predators. We studied a population of Uinta ground squirrels (Spermophilus armatus) inhabiting patches of grassland and sagebrush in the northern range of Yellowstone National Park to determine if the presence of view-obstructing vegetation would be associated with differences in vigilance behavior of individuals. We also compared rates of weight gain and population estimates in grassland and sagebrush patches to determine if these factors would vary in association with differences in time budgets and perceived risk of predation in these patch types. Although there were differences among sites in time spent foraging and maintaining vigilance, these differences were not consistent between sites of similar habitat and degree of visual obstruction. These results suggest that the relationship between visibility and vigilance for this species may be complicated by the dual nature of shrubs as visual obstructions and as protection from attacking predators. The relationship between these 2 factors will likely influence how prey species respond to alterations to the vegetative structure of their environments. Ground squirrels, specifically, appear to be capable of adapting to variation in the structure of the vegetation and will likely thrive as long as an abundance of grasses are available to provide fattening seeds for forage."

I studied how the amount of information about predators influenced yellowhammers' (Emberiza citrinella) foraging delay and alert perching behavior. Yellowhammers were shown a flying sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) silhouette, which elicited alarm calls, or a square piece of wood (control), which elicited flight calls. Yellowhammers that could not see the sparrowhawk model, but heard the alarm calls, had less complete information about the predation risk than those that actually saw the sparrowhawk. Hearing alarm calls affected the behavior of yellowhammers. Birds with less complete information about the predator exhibited alert perching more often immediately after the encounter than did birds that saw the sparrowhawk model. Also, birds that saw the sparrowhawk resumed foraging earliest, while birds that heard the alarm calls resumed foraging latest. Although there was a tendency for a significant difference in body mass between dominant and sub-dominant individuals, there was no significant difference in foraging delay. Both the foraging delay and the increase in alert perching caused lost feeding opportunities. Completeness of information and its effect on decision-making may thus affect the fitness of an animal."

Among all six species studied, foraging accounted for the most common use of time, ranging from 19 % in male Pintail to 40-60 % in female Mallard, Teal, Pintail and Gadwall. Comfort behaviours amounted to 20-34 % of the time budget, and interaction and disturbance were marginal. Vigilance time ranged from 8 % in female Mallard to 20 % in male Pintail. Movement amounted to some 20 % of the time in most species and sexes. In Wigeon, sexes did not differ in time use, whereas in Mallard, Pintail and, in particular, Teal, females foraged more and engaged less in vigilance and interactions than did males. In addition, Teal and Mallard males engaged in the riskier foraging methods less than females, but more in those permitting vigilance. Although overlap in feeding methods was large among these species, Mallard and Teal were generalists, feeding at all depths, Wigeon foraged mainly in shallow water and Pintail foraged essentially in deep water. Our results support the income/capital breeder hypothesis with respect to males only; compared to lighter species, heavier species allocated less time to foraging but more to vigilance. We found no support for the hypothesis that long-distance migrants forage more to compensate for energy loss due to migratory flight. Foraging time in females was related to breeding phenology; early nesters spent more time feeding than later nesters."

According to the risk allocation hypothesis, prey increase antipredatory behaviour and reduce foraging activity during pulses of high risk, but with continuous risk, other activities must continue and antipredatory behaviour decreases despite the risk. We studied the impact of lynx presence on the vigilance behaviour of wild roe deer under conditions of (i) a pulsed elevated risk by experimentally spreading lynx urine as an olfactory cue, and (ii) continuous risk by comparing an area where lynx was eradicated 160years ago to an area where lynx has been re-introduced 30years ago. Roe deer were extremely vigilant in response to the predator olfactory cue; however, roe deer vigilance did not differ measurably among areas with or without potential lynx presence. Deer were more vigilant before sunset than during the night at both study areas, probably due to long-term adaptation of roe deer to human hunting during daytime. Vigilance decreased from August to September even though activity of lynx increases in autumn, which may be a result either of increased foraging due to decrease in food quality in autumn, or of changes in social organization of the deer. Our results suggested that the degree of vigilance depends on environmental cues. We found that roe deer respond to lynx urine despite a long absence of lynx in the ecosystem. Our results support the risk allocation hypothesis for responses to pulses of high risk but not for responses to continuous elevated levels of risk."
"Barta, Z; Liker, A; Monus, F",The effects of predation risk on the use of social foraging tactics,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,67,301,308,10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.06.012,2004,"The effects of predation on the use of social foraging tactics, such as producing and scrounging, are poorly known in animals. On the one hand, recent theoretical models predict increased use of scrounging with increasing predation risk, when scroungers seeking feeding opportunities also have a higher chance of detecting predators. On the other hand, there may be no relation between tactic use and predation when antipredator vigilance is not compatible with scanning flockmates. We investigated experimentally the effects of predation risk on social foraging tactic use in tree sparrows, Passer montanus. We manipulated predation risk in the field by changing the distance between shelter and a feeder. Birds visited the feeder in smaller flocks, spent less time on it and were somewhat more vigilant far from shelter than close to it. Increased predation risk strongly affected the social foraging tactic used: birds used the scrounger tactic 30% more often far from cover than close to it. Between-flock variability in scrounging frequency was not related to the average vigilance level of the flock members, and within-flock variability in the use of scrounging was negatively related to the vigilance of birds. Our results suggest that in tree sparrows, the increased frequency of scrounging during high predation risk cannot simply be explained by an additional advantage of increasing antipredator vigilance. We propose alternative mechanisms (e.g. increased stochasticity in food supply, and that riskier places are used by individuals with lower reserves) that may explain increased scrounging when animals forage under high predation risk.

These behavioral shifts may be an adaptive response to urbanization, but it may be costly if animals in urban areas also exhibit reduced anti-predator behavior in the presence of natural predators. In trials with only a human observer as the stimulus, urban squirrels exhibited reduced vigilance and anti-predator behavior compared to those in less urban areas. Next, we exposed squirrels in multiple urban and less urban sites to acoustic playbacks of a control stimulus (non-predatory bird calls), a natural predator (hawk), and dogs and recorded their vigilance and three different anti-predator behaviors when a human approached them while either broadcasting one of these three playbacks or no playbacks at all. Squirrels at urban sites also did not differ in their behavioral responses to the playbacks from possible predators (hawks or dogs) when they were compared to those at less urban sites exposed to these playbacks. Urban squirrels also exhibited increased vigilance and anti-predator behavior when exposed to a human paired with hawk playbacks compared to the control playbacks. Together, our results indicate that urban squirrels did perceive and assess risk to the natural predator appropriately despite exhibiting increased tolerance to humans. These results provide little support for the hypothesis that increased tolerance to humans causes animals to lose their fear of natural predators."

The Striped Cuckoo (Tapera naevia) is a New World brood-parasitic cuckoo that uses counter-singing and duets in reproduction and territory defense. Here, we report the first observations of adult-juvenile social interactions in the Striped Cuckoo. In contrast to their normally solitary lives, juveniles and adults moved and foraged together and engaged in counter-singing and duets. Striped Cuckoo adults often initiated the social interactions and engaged in vigilance behaviors when with the juveniles. We suggest further study to determine if adults are interacting with related juveniles."

Here, we test risk-taking behaviour to experimentally placed predators in the presence or absence of nestlings. We use the superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus) to test the prediction that vigilance will be comparable with and without nestlings, but that alarm vocalisations will increase when nestlings are present. We found support for both predictions. Adult vigilance of predators was comparable with and without nestlings. Alarm vocalisation intensity was predicted by predator type and nestling presence, and was highest to the snake model in the presence of nestlings. These results point to selection for differentiated nest defence response in relation to predator type and the presence or absence of nestlings."

In this study, we investigated the level of synchronization at arrivals at and departures from a feeding platform in flock-feeding tree sparrows (Passer montanus) under two different conditions; near to a protective cover or far from it. Sparrow flocks spent 43% less time in a feeding bout, and waited 30% more between bouts, far from the cover than near to it. The relationship of vigilance and flock size was different between the two conditions; the proportion of time allocated to vigilance increased more with decreasing flock size when far from the cover than when near to it. These results suggest that sparrows perceived higher predation risk when fed farther away from the protective cover. Furthermore, we found that far from the cover arrivals of sparrows were 79% more synchronized than when close to the cover. Finally, we did not find significant difference between the two feeding conditions in the synchronization at the departure. Possibly, due to its escape function, departures may be as synchronized as possible, even when feeding near to the protective cover."

Many factors influence vigilance behaviour, and the effect of group size has had a great deal of attention in recent years. The group size effect hypothesis proposes that there is a negative relationship between group size and vigilance, which has been proven ture for many birds and mammal species. However this relationship has not been investigated for a number of other species including the Equus kiang. The E. kiang is the largest wild ass in the world, and endemic to the Tibetan Plateau. Previous studies have reported its distribution and reproduction, but information about their behaviour especially their daytime activity budgets is still very limited. Also unknown is if the distinctive habitat of the Tibetan Plateau makes their behaviour different from other Equidae species. So in this paper, we discuss our behavioural observations of the daytime activity budgets and the group size effect on vigilance for the E. kiang population in the Arjinshan National Nature Reserve, Xinjiang, China. The results indicate that group size has a significant effect on the vigilance levels: with an increase in group size, both the group scan level decreased and group scan frequency increased. Our results also showed that E. Idang spent most of their time feeding (51.41 +/- 2.74 %), followed by moving (22.49 +/- 1.40 %), standing (19.62 +/- 6.74 %), resting (18.41 +/- 2.13 %), and other activities (8.64 +/- 0.72 %). Their feeding behaviour showed three distinct activity peaks during the day: early morning (8:00-11:00), midday (14:30-15:30), and around sunset (18:00-19:30). During the peaks of activity, E. kiang spent most of their time feeding, and during the period of inactivity, E. kiang spent most of their time resting and standing. So the group size effect was supported for E. kiang by this study, and our results are consistent with research on other Equidae species."

However, it is difficult to make mechanistic inferences because several confounding factors, such as food deprivation levels, food availability, neighbor distance, and group size can mask or amplify spatial position effects. We attempted to address experimentally the effect of spatial position on foraging and vigilance in a group, controlling for many confounding factors. We used enclosures that restricted physical but not visual interactions between brown-headed cowbirds and manipulated spatial position, flock size, and neighbor distance. Pecking rate (number of pecks per trial duration) was not related with position, but instantaneous pecking rate (number of pecks per foraging bout duration) was higher at the edge. The proportion of time spent head-up (scanning and food-handling) was also higher at the edge. For pecking rate and proportion of time spent scanning, changes in neighbor distance influenced the behavior of edge birds to a lesser extent than central birds. These results suggest that cowbirds at the edge perceived greater predation risk and that during the limited foraging time available, edge birds tried to compensate by foraging at a faster rate."

Apart from intraspecific communication, tail flicking could be used during predator-prey communication, e.g., as a signal of prey vigilance or quality. We studied this behavior in the black redstart (Phoenicurus ochruros), a species that frequently shows tail flicking and is prone to attacks by ambushing predators that hide in cover. Hence, cover might be perceived as dangerous by this species. We hypothesized that flicking should increase with decreasing distance to cover. We counted the number of tail flicks of individuals and measured their distance to the nearest cover for an ambushing predator. We found that distance to cover had a significant effect on tail flicking behavior, as flicking increased with decreasing distance, but found no difference in flicking frequency between adults and juveniles or between sexes. Consequently, tail flicking is unlikely to signal submission or to be sexually selected in the black redstart. Since tail flicking also occurred in the absence of predators, we consider tail flicking in black redstarts to display vigilance and to be directed towards ambushing predators."

These behaviours are usually believed to be mutually exclusive. The most intense foraging effort is predicted to occur in low-risk situations, while more antipredator behaviour is seen in high-risk situations. We studied the time allocation of individual light-bellied brent geese, Branta bermicla hrota, and the proportion of the flock engaged in foraging and vigilance behaviour in high- and low-risk habitats. Geese faced with a depleted resource in a low-risk intertidal situation responded by foraging in a higher-risk terrestrial habitat. Individual intake rates and levels of agonistic interactions were higher during terrestrial feeding, but group vigilance was maintained, with certain flock positions showing disproportionate levels of vigilance. In contrast to previous studies, agonistic interactions were more frequent when the geese were feeding on a nonpatchy resource, suggesting that different mechanisms drive agonistic encounters in different habitats. We discuss these results in the context of a growing population with limited resources. By remaining behaviourally plastic, the geese are able to adapt novel trade-off strategies to use alternative prey types. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behavior.

"Bustnes, Jan Ove",Exploitation of others' vigilance by the Common Eider Somateria mollissima,Wildfowl,44,108,110,,1993,"Individuals obtain advantages from group-living through reduced probability of predation (Hamilton 1971). In addition to reducing the perimeter exposed to predators, flocking behaviour also increases vigilance, and thereby reduces the chance of surprise attacks (Krebs & Davies 1986). In the Common Eider Somateria mollissima flocking behaviour during brood-rearing is very frequent. These groups are often called creches, and such behaviour has been explained as an adaptation for minimizing predation on the ducklings (Ahlen & Andersson 1970, Gorman & Milne 1972, Bedard & Munro 1976, Munro & Bedard 1977a,b, Bustnes & Erikstad 1991a). However, females, that do not care for young themselves, are often temporarily present in or near creches (Munro & Bedard 1977a, Schmutz et al. 1982, Bustnes & Erikstad 1991b). Adult Common Eider are exposed to dangers, such as harassment by kleptoparasitic gulls (Ingolfsson 1969) and, in some areas (e.g. northern Norway), predation from birds of prey such as White-tailed Eagles Haliaeetus albicilla (Norderhaug 1978). Females that care for ducklings spend 40 to 45% of a feeding bout watching for potential duckling predators (Bustnes & Erikstad 1991a). It would thus seem advantageous for a female without young to stay close to brood-caring females, thereby exploiting the high degree of vigilance that will enable them to feed more effectively (Bustnes & Erikstad 1991b). In order to test this hypothesis, I recorded time budgets of females, without young, that were feeding close to or away from creches."

Possible functions are flushing insects, displaying submission and signalling an individual's state of alertness to predators. To distinguish between these, I observed feeding and preening white wagtails in August-September 2004 near Husum, Germany. I counted vigilance events (head-up and left-right scans), tail wags and pecks during feeding. Adults and juveniles did not differ in the frequency of tail wagging. Feeding wagtails wagged more often than preening wagtails and, among feeding wagtails, wagging was positively correlated with scanning and negatively correlated with pecking. In preening wagtails wagging was positively correlated with left-right scans. The prey-flushing hypothesis was partially supported, but seems unlikely since wagging occurred during preening and was negatively correlated with pecking. As wagging did not differ between adults and juveniles it is unlikely to signal submission. It may be an honest signal of vigilance during both feeding and preening; this would explain the negative correlation between wagging and pecking because wagtails adopt a nonvigilant posture during pecking.

In substrate-brooding fishes, sneakers try to steal fertilizations by suddenly rushing towards females from outside the spawning sites, but they are usually caught through territorial vigilance before rushing. Nevertheless, attention is seldom paid to how sneakers overcome territorial vigilance, which limits the ecological and evolutionary understanding of alternative reproductive tactics. I addressed this issue in the triplefin blenny, Enneapterygius etheostoma, by analysing sneaker behaviour recorded in the wild. Prior to rushing, sneakers gradually got closer to the spawning sites while repeatedly pausing and moving forwards but spent most of their time pausing. They moved slowly for short distances. Territorial males detected about three-quarters of the sneaking attempts. A sneaker was detected usually immediately after starting to move, indicating that movement was a major cause of sneaking failure. Longer and faster movements were detected more frequently, particularly further from spawning sites. Movements were also detected more when territorial males faced towards, rather than away from, the sneakers. This suggests that both sneaker performance and the attentive state of territorial males affect sneaking success. Sneakers more frequently started moving from behind territorial males than from in front of them, and were then less frequently detected. In sum, sneakers seemed to conceal their movements through pause-travel locomotion, adjusting their movements and choosing favourable situations. Nevertheless, they were still detected by motion-sensitive territorial males. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Ten runs with each prey dispersion treatment were performed with shoals of one, two, five and ten chromis. The mean lag in reaching peak feeding rate for fish fed on aggregated prey was significantly shorter in the larger chromis shoals. In contrast, with the scattered treatment all such lags were similar and very short. As foraging proceeded, higher feeding rates were observed in the larger feeding shoals, regardless of prey dispersion. Prey capture success (i.e. the rate of retention of intercepted prey) declined with time, but was significantly higher in groups of ten fish. Two main conclusions emerge. Firstly, grouping facilitated initiation of feeding by individuals preying on concentrated swarms and reduced the delay in reaching a maximum feeding level. This may have been due to a suppression of the confusion effect through reduced reliance upon vigilance. Secondly, reduced vigilance allowed larger shoals of chromis to feed effectively over more extended periods. Trends of increasing shoal cohesion and decreasing prey retention rate with time were consistent with a postulated increase in antipredator vigilance with declining feeding motivation."

Individuals must decide when to respond to alarm calls as a function of the relative costs and benefits, but experiments investigating contextual influences are rare. We used playback experiments in conjunction with supplementary feeding and the presentation of direct predator cues to examine variation in receiver responses to alarm calls in a habituated population of wild dwarf mongooses. First, we investigated whether individuals adjust their response to alarm calls depending on their own satiation level and spatial position of the caller. Individuals were more likely to respond to alarm calls when they had received supplementary food, and hence could prioritize minimization of predation risk over starvation. There was also increased responsiveness to alarm calls given by individuals from elevated positions compared to those on the ground; sentinels (raised guards) are more likely to detect potential predators than foragers, and alarm calls from elevated positions are probably perceived as more reliable. When individuals did respond, they were more likely to flee following an alarm call given from ground level; foragers are likely to detect predators in closer proximity than sentinels, requiring more urgent escape responses. Second, we examined how individuals combine social information provided by alarm calls with personal information relating to predator presence. Receiver responses to terrestrial and aerial alarm calls did not differ when they followed interaction with an olfactory predator cue compared to an olfactory control cue. Following interaction with a terrestrial predator cue, however, latency to nonvigilance was significantly longer after hearing an aerial alarm call than after hearing a terrestrial alarm call, potentially because of social information novelty. Our results provide experimental evidence that receivers respond flexibly to alarm calls depending on receiver, signaller and external factors.

To avoid the confounding variables associated with foraging and preening, the effects of increasing levels of disturbance on vigilance by measuring distances among individuals (D) in flocks of greater flamingoes was studied. During 61 h, reactions to 112 disturbances were recorded. Undisturbed flamingoes exhibited no relationship between D and flock size. When joggers appeared, birds became alert but continued to feed. D was uninfluenced by flock size when jeeps drove past, but was different in value from that in undisturbed necks. However, when tours stopped and occupants got out of their vehicles, D was significantly reduced and flock size was positively correlated with flock cohesiveness, i.e., smaller necks had smaller D values than larger necks. Flamingoes were terrified of all-terrain vehicles, and in 82% of these encounters, they flew away. In these cases, flock cohesiveness was extremely dense, but flock size did not influence flock reaction. This study shows that flocking species seek protection in numbers, and they leave the area when insufficient conspecifics are present when serious disturbance occurs."

Though many interspecific associations have been described for closely related mammals, few studies have examined the associations between mammals in different orders. The yellow mongoose (Cynictus pencillata), a carnivore, and the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), a rodent, co-occur in arid and semi-arid South Africa where they share sleeping burrows, predators, a similar body size, and the capability to emit alarm calls in response to predators. To investigate enhanced predator avoidance as a potential benefit explaining the persistence of this association, we assessed individual mongoose vigilance alone and with squirrels or other mongooses, and with varying interspecific group size, using field observations. We also tested for responses to conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls in both study species using playback experiments. The proportion of time mongoose individuals spent vigilant decreased in the presence of squirrels or other mongooses and was negatively correlated with interspecific group size; a similar pattern was previously shown for conspecific groups of Cape ground squirrels. These results are predicted by both the dilution and collective detection hypotheses. In addition, hetero- and conspecific alarm calls elicited vigilance responses in both species. These results suggest that both species can benefit from the collective detection and dilution arising from their interspecific association and that this interspecific association could be mutualistic."

Prior studies reporting altered performance following exposure to stress in adolescence have generally interpreted lasting changes as impairments. However, we have recently shown that exposure to chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence (from post-natal days 30-70) can enhance performance in a context-dependent manner during a foraging task. Increases in foraging performance, (previously measured by the number of rewards obtained), are often associated with trade-offs in other behaviours, such as vigilance. Here, we examined the effect of stress exposure in adolescence on adult foraging in male Sprague Dawley rats to determine (1) whether the increase in foraging performance exhibited by animals exposed to stress in adolescence is balanced by a decrease in vigilance, and (2) whether stress in adolescence alters time allocation between foraging and vigilance behaviours in low- and high-threat conditions. We found no evidence of a trade-off between foraging and vigilance; under low-threat conditions, rats exposed to stress in adolescence spent more time being vigilant compared with unstressed rats, suggesting that exposure to stress in adolescence enhances anticipation of threat in adulthood. Under high-threat conditions, adolescent-stressed and unstressed rats did not differ in foraging and vigilance behaviours. Given that we have previously found that rats exposed to stress in adolescence nearly double food intake under high-threat, and we now show that high-performing rats do not spend more time foraging, it appears that stress exposure in adolescence may enhance foraging efficiency (food consumed/time) under high-threat conditions rather than time allocation between foraging and competing behaviours. We also examined the relationship, at the level of the individual, between foraging performance and foraging and vigilance behaviours. We found that changes in individual foraging performance between low- and high-threat conditions were independent of behavioural changes (i.e. both highly and poorly performing rats were equally active and contacted a similar number of patches). This suggests that the ability to obtain many rewards under high-threat conditions may be related to efficiency, rather than the frequency of foraging and effort-related behaviours."

Recent studies have argued that they may be the result of sexual or social selection acting on females. Here, we explored the role of the white wing patch during the incubation period in female-female competition contests in a migratory cavity-nesting songbird, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. At this stage, female investment is crucial for offspring survival, while competition among females for nest cavities is still operating. We experimentally performed an extreme reduction of signaling capacity by covering the wing patch with dark paint in a group of females and compared their incubation attendance and social interaction patterns (vigilance and aggression at the nest as defense variables) during simulated territorial intrusion tests with female decoys, with those of an unmanipulated group of females. Tests were performed both before and after the manipulation. We hypothesized that these patches constitute signals of social dominance in female-female interactions that allow them to maintain high levels of incubation attendance by reducing the need for vigilance. We found a marked decrease in incubation attendance in experimental females after manipulation, a change that was not found in the control group. Moreover, vigilance decreased in the control group after the manipulation, a change not detected in manipulated females. No effects on aggressive nest defense were found. Female wing ornamental traits would act as a badge of status in social interactions allowing more intense incubation and reduced vigilance. Implications of social interactions on incubation patterns should be incorporated in future studies.Significance statementAnimals can transmit information to the others through different traits. Ornamental signals have been proposed as status indicators in social interactions in birds in many studies. Although some of them concern their function and evolution in females, only a few have been focused on their role during incubation. Our experimental study suggests that the female's white wing patch in pied flycatchers acts as a badge of dominance status in social encounters. Thus, dominant females may enforce respect from competitors through signaling, thereby being able to reduce vigilance at the nest with positive effects on incubation efficiency. Implications of social status for incubation patterns should be considered in future studies as an additional factor modulating this crucial parental activity."

In alarm communication, call recipients in a social group evaluate alarm calls, enhancing their probability of survival in the face of predatory threats. Calls from na < ve and younger group members might be less evocative, in terms of rendering group members vigilant, than calls from more experienced adults because adults are generally more reliable. It remains uncertain, however, what acoustic characteristics render an alarm call reliable. Here, we report that adult degus, Octodon degus (Rodentia, Octodontidae), produced an alarm with a frequency-modulated (FM) syllable, accompanied by low bandwidth and entropy, to evoke a high-vigilance response amongst receivers. Unlike adults, subadult degus did not emit the FM syllable in the warning context, and their call without the FM syllable evoked less vigilance than the adult alarm. We suggest that the FM structure of the adult-produced syllable serves as the primary feature characterizing a reliable alarm call. Our results are consistent with those found in other social rodents, e.g., ground squirrels and gerbils, also produce FM alarm calls in high-urgency situations supports the importance of the FM syllable in alarm communication."

Differences in diet, in vulnerability to predation, and in behaviour between the sexes are hypothesized to drive sexual segregation; however, low-density conditions sometimes favour aggregation. This may occur because larger groups provide greater antipredator benefits that overcome the cost of association between the sexes. In this study we sought to determine whether bighorn rams and ewes (Ovis canadensis) aggregate during winter as an antipredator strategy and whether they alter their behaviour to maintain mixed-sex groups. We compared the occurrence of mixed-sex groups during winter against the population size and sex ratio, and assessed vigilance as an indication of predation risk. We also analysed activity budgets to determine whether group cohesion required departure from sex-specific time budgets. We observed a low proportion of mixed-sex groups in all years of our study except one, in which the population size was very small and the proportion of females was the smallest on record. Mixed-sex groups were larger than single-sex groups, and vigilance was lower in larger groups, indicating that mixed-sex groups provided greater antipredator benefits. However, there was evidence of the oddity effect for older females, which displayed greater vigilance in groups composed primarily of males. Females modified their activity budgets in mixed-sex groups by spending less time foraging and travelling and more time bedding, providing support for the activity budget hypothesis. The costs of mixed-sex group formation limit the circumstances under which aggregation of the sexes is favourable. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The black-tailed prairie dog is a colonial small mammal with alarm vocalizations that confer benefits via group vigilance against predators and increased foraging time. Although prairie dog alarm calls are relatively well understood, the information embedded in their jump-yip call, which includes both a distinct cry and a bodily gesture, remains less clear. We evaluated prairie dog behaviour in response to conspecific acoustic signals using playbacks of alarm and jump-yip calls at 26 sites in northeastern Wyoming, U.S.A. Recorded calls from an isolated colony were broadcast to a mean of five individuals per site, and behavioural responses were compared against uninfluenced behaviour and a control playback of ambient sounds. The alarm playback caused prairie dogs to increase vigilance 122% and decrease foraging time 23%, demonstrating prairie dogs will shift behaviour based on signals from individuals of an unfamiliar colony. However, the alarm call playback reduced frequency of the jump-yip behaviour only at colonies nearest the recording source. The jump-yip playback caused unfamiliar prairie dogs to display 339% more jump-yips than uninfluenced behaviour. The jump-yip playback did not alter recipients' foraging or vigilance behaviours relative to control treatments, suggesting that although prairie dogs can understand and reciprocate an unfamiliar, single modality signal, they may not shift other behaviours based on this stimulus. As such, the purpose and benefits of the jump-yip call remain unclear. Playback efficacy also had a nonlinear relationship with distance from recording source. Our work improves understanding of communication at the metapopulation level, examines the potential role of the jump-yip and provides insights for how conspecific signals might be used as a management tool.

"White, KS; Berger, J",Antipredator strategies of Alaskan moose: are maternal trade-offs influenced by offspring activity?,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,79,2055,2062,10.1139/cjz-79-11-2055,2001,"To maximize fitness, mothers must both provision and protect neonates, demands that may be in conflict, particularly in systems that still experience high levels of natural predation. Whether variation in offspring behaviour alters this putative conflict is not known. The objective of this study was to test hypotheses about the extent to which neonatal activity and ecological variables mediate trade-offs between maternal vigilance and foraging. To address these questions we contrasted data from behavioural observations on female moose (Alces alces) that differed in parity, calf activity, and habitat use at a site in south-central Alaska where they are subject to high levels of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and wolf (Canis lupus) predation. Our analyses revealed that females with active juveniles were more vigilant (and as a consequence spent less time feeding) than those with inactive young; vigilance of females without attendant young was intermediate. Distance to apparent protective refugia (e.g., vegetative cover) was positively related to vigilance for all calf-status categories, but lactating females spent more time closer to thick vegetation than did nonlactating females. These results suggest that (i) mothers adjust vigilance when young are inactive to compensate for the loss of foraging opportunities during periods of neonate activity, thereby reducing juvenile vulnerability and increasing the overall feeding rate, and (ii) females with young reduce foraging compromises and, presumably, predation risk by spending more time close to protective cover than do nonlactating females. We conclude that maternal trade-offs can be highly labile and that mothers are able to adjust rapidly to environment-specific situations."

During the late stages of the hiding phase, infants begin a transition out of hiding and show behavioural changes that increase their exposure to predators. Mothers in many hider species are known to show potentially costly changes in habitat use, gregariousness and vigilance behaviour at the onset of the hiding phase. However, the effects of infant transitional behaviour on maternal behavioural patterns are understudied. In this study, we compare the behavioural patterns of Thomson's gazelle, Eudorcas thomsonii, females with young and transitioning fawns to determine the effect of fawn behavioural changes on maternal behaviour. We found that, although transitioning fawns were at greater risk than younger fawns while hidden, mothers of transitioning fawns were less vigilant than mothers of younger fawns during hiding periods. Mothers and fawns relied on group membership rather than heightened maternal vigilance to mitigate fawn risk during the transition. Group membership is apparently made possible by the shorter hiding bouts of transitioning fawns relative to younger fawns: more frequent activity bouts probably enable mothers to relocate their fawns more frequently, which helps the mother and fawn to keep up with group movements.

"Burger, Joanna",Vigilance and escape behavior in marine toad tadpoles in Peru.,Herpetological Natural History,9,63,68,,2002,"The response of marine toad (Bufo marinus) tadpoles resting in shallow pools, channels, or depressions to an approaching human was examined to assess their escape behavior and relative risk. More tadpoles occurred in larger pools compared to smaller depressions. Antipredator response was directly related to group size. In larger groups, tadpoles responded when the observer was farther away. Not only did some tadpoles in the larger groups respond sooner, but all tadpoles in that group responded sooner compared with tadpoles in smaller groups. Tadpoles either moved deeper into the pools or under cover. A sooner response, seeking cover, and swimming deeper into pools presumably reduces the predation risk from terrestrial predators, including mammals and birds, such as herons."

We studied the effects of group size, habitat (shrubland steppe v. meadows), and risk of hunting by humans (protected core area v. edge area exposed to poaching) on vigilance and foraging behaviour of wild populations of the Lesser Rhea (Rhea pennata pennata), a near-threatened ratite, in north-western Patagonia, Argentina. On average, Lesser Rheas allocated 18% of their time to vigilance and 67% to foraging. Individuals tended to be more vigilant with declining group size, in areas with low visibility that hinders escape by running, and in areas exposed to hunting, than in open habitats with abundant food or sites with low risk of hunting. Although time spent foraging was also influenced by habitat type and hunting risk, there was no direct relationship between foraging time and group size. As in other species of ratite, Lesser Rheas seem to take advantage of flocking as an anti-predation strategy. Our data do not only confirm the influence of group size, but also of habitat structure and hunting risk, in determining the behaviour of this flightless bird in the wild."

The ability to modify time allocation as a function of group size is an antipredator behavior that has been reported in some, but not all, previous studies of members of the genus Macropus. We studied group-size effects and space use for agile wallabies foraging in the open to develop a better understanding of behavior of mid-sized macropods. We found that agile wallabies modified time allocated to foraging and vigilance as a function of group size but were insensitive to distance from cover. We contrast the group size results from agile wallabies with those from other macropodids and speculate that predation by saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) may have a profound effect on how agile wallabies perceive and manage predation risk."
Lu Xin,Anti-predation vigilance of individual Tibetan eared pheasants temporarily separated from the flocks,Acta Zoologica Sinica,50,32,36,,2004,"Individual animals living in group with stable membership may gain a long-term fitness benefit through sharing predation risk with other partners, but meanwhile undertake a potential cost of competing for food resources. This cost often depends on the type of food resources. Individuals do not keep together all the time and a few may split themselves from the current flocks when good foods are available for only themselves. In evolutionary ecology, it is interesting to know how those temporary extra-range individuals organize their anti-predation vigilance. Tibetan eared pheasant Crossoptilon harmani is typically gregarious throughout the non-breeding season in alpine shrub vegetation around mid-Yalong Zangbo River, Tibet. Sometimes a few individuals were observed to leave the current flocks if they discovered good food resources. Separation from the flock was more likely when original flock size was larger but less likely if more extra-range foragers were present. The duration of separation events was longer when there were more extra-range foragers. Similar to a widely reported relationship in natural size flocks of many species of birds, vigilance levels of the free individual eared pheasants declined as the extra-range flock size increased. Whether to leave current flocks and how long to keep solitary were believed to be a result of individual's trade-off between current food reward and predation risk. The trade-off also provided an explanation for strong grouping behavior of the eared pheasants."

It was investigated whether the presence of geese provided benefits to coots in terms of reduced vigilance and whether the association incurs costs, e.g., by reduced foraging success. Further, the hypothesis was tested whether a decrease in vigilance rate is mirrored by an increase in feeding rate. A digital video camera was used to record behavior of the same individual. Head-Lip movements were considered to have vigilant function when the bill was raised up from the foraging position to a position nearly parallel with the horizontal line, or when raised to a position higher than the body (high-cost vigilance). Coot feeding in the presence of geese showed a significantly lower scan rate. Steps per minute did not differ between the coot with and without geese, but the time taken for 30 pecks was significantly shorter in the presence of geese. There was a significant negative correlation between feeding and scan rate, suggesting that scanning decreased peck rate. Further, scan rate was inversely correlated with total flock size (number of coot and geese), suggesting that coot recognized the geese as flock mates. Coot benefited from feeding in the proximity to geese by a lower scan rate and a higher peck rate, but they did not encounter costs in terms of reduced food quality as measured by step rate."

The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey is expected to adjust key anti-predator behaviours such as vigilance to temporal variation in risk. We tested the predictions of the risk allocation hypothesis in a natural environment where both a species-rich natural predator community and human hunters are abundant and where the differences in seasonal and circadian activity between natural and anthropogenic predators provided a unique opportunity to quantify the contributions of different predator classes to anti-predator behaviour. Whereas natural predators were expected to show similar levels of activity throughout the seasons, hunter activity was high during the daytime during a clearly defined hunting season. According to the risk allocation hypothesis, vigilance should then be higher during the hunting season and during daytime hours than during the non-hunting season and night-time hours. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) on the edge of Biaowiea Primeval Forest in Eastern Poland displayed vigilance behaviour consistent with these predictions. The behavioural response of roe deer to temporarily varying predation risks emphasises the behavioural plasticity of this species and suggests that future studies of anti-predator behaviour need to incorporate circadian variation in predation pressure as well as risk gradients of both natural and anthropogenic predators."
"Townsend, Simon W.; Zoettl, Markus; Manser, Marta B.",All clear? Meerkats attend to contextual information in close calls to coordinate vigilance,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,65,1927,1934,10.1007/s00265-011-1202-6,2011,"Socio-demographic factors, such as group size and their effect on predation vulnerability, have, in addition to intrinsic factors, dominated as explanations when attempting to understand animal vigilance behaviour. It is generally assumed that animals evaluate these external factors visually; however, many socially foraging species adopt a foraging technique that directly compromises the visual system. In these instances, such species may instead rely more on the acoustical medium to assess their relative risk and guide their subsequent anti-predator behaviour. We addressed this question in the socially foraging meerkat (Suricata suricatta). Meerkats forage with their head down, but at the same time frequently produce close calls ('Foraging' close calls). Close calls are also produced just after an individual has briefly scanned the surrounding environment for predators ('Guarding' close calls). Here, we firstly show that these Guarding and Foraging close call variants are in fact acoustically distinct and secondly subjects are less vigilant (in terms of frequency and time) when exposed to Guarding close call playbacks than when they hear Foraging close calls. We argue that this is the first evidence for socially foraging animals using the information encoded within calls, the main adaptive function of which is unrelated to immediate predator encounters, to coordinate their vigilance behaviour. In addition, these results provide new insights into the potential cognitive mechanisms underlying anti-predator behaviour and suggest meerkats may be capable of signalling to group members the 'absence' of predatory threat. If we are to fully understand the complexities underlying the coordination of animal anti-predator behaviour, we encourage future studies to take these additional auditory and cognitive dimensions into account."

We measured vigilance by observing individual prairie dogs for 5 min and recording the amount of time the individual spent vigilant or foraging. In addition, the total number of individuals in the colony that were actively vigilant or foraging were counted every 10 min for 1 h. Prairie dogs in rural colonies were more vigilant than those in urban colonies and displayed a lower proportion of individuals that were non-vigilant in both the spring and summer. Because prairie dogs in urban colonies might be habituated to disturbance and have a relatively low risk of predation, individuals spent much less time vigilant. Our findings could be used to better understand behavioral changes in black-tailed prairie dogs caused by encroaching urban development."
"Peterson, Jeffrey, V; Fuentes, Agustin",Do long-tailed macaques avoid large heterospecific carcasses?,BEHAVIOUR,158,341,352,10.1163/1568539X-bja10067,2021,This anecdotal observation details the response of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) to a heterospecific carcass. The subgroup of macaques we were following abruptly changed their direction of travel upon reaching a tree line while displaying silent vigilance behaviour. We later discovered a dog carcass in the area and concluded their behaviour may have been in response to the smell of that carcass. The carcass was not visible from the response point at the tree line due to its distance from that point (approximately 30 meters) and the uneven and densely vegetated terrain between. The macaques were therefore most likely responding to scent cues from the carcass. We suggest the observed vigilance behaviour is excessive under a strictly pathogen-avoidance explanation and may be understood as a response to a cue of potential predation risk. We review alternative explanations and suggest future research on nonhuman primate heterospecific carcass avoidance is necessary to fully assess the potential relation to perceived risk of predation.

G.",Response of Anolis sagrei to Acoustic Calls from Predatory and Nonpredatory Birds,JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY,47,293,298,10.1670/11-184,2013,"Many studies indicate that various vertebrates and invertebrates use sensory cues to recognize predators and to evaluate predation risk. Lizards and birds frequently occupy the same habitats; consequently, avian predation on lizards has been implicated as an important selective pressure on lizard behavior. However, there are few studies on how lizards respond to nonvisual cues. The response of adult male Brown Anoles (Anolis sagrei) to calls of birds was studied to determine whether they use auditory cues as an indicator of predation risk from birds. Anoles responded significantly more often with head tilt (increased vigilance) during playback of predatory vocalizations (Kestrel and Red-tailed Hawk calls) compared with low-risk stimuli (nonpredatory bird calls and white noise). Responses to auditory cues suggest that male Brown Anoles are able to distinguish the calls of birds known to prey upon lizards from the calls of nonpredatory birds. More important, this study demonstrates that anoles, most of which are nonvocal, are able to obtain information about predation risk through the use of auditory cues and that the role of hearing in these lizards has been underappreciated."

We used 35 years of observational data on cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) hunts in Serengeti National Park to investigate whether cheetahs' prey handling behavior varied in response to threats from lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Male cheetahs and single females, whose main threat was kleptoparasitism, minimized time on the kill by being less vigilant and eating quickly, thereby shortening their handling times. Mothers with cubs showed a different strategy that prioritized vigilance over speed of eating, which increased time spent handling prey. Vigilance allowed them to minimize the risk of their cubs being killed while giving cubs the time they need to eat at the carcass. Flexible behavioral strategies that minimize individual risk while handling prey likely allow mesocarnivores to coexist with numerous and widespread apex predators.Significance statementMedium-sized carnivores like cheetahs face the challenge of coexisting with larger carnivores that steal their kills and kill their cubs. We investigated how cheetahs modify their behavior on kills to minimize risks from larger predators. Using 35 years of data on 400+ cheetah hunts across 159 individuals, we found that cheetahs without cubs whose primary danger is having their kill stolen spent little time engaged in vigilance and instead ate quickly, reducing the risk of theft. Mothers with cubs, however, took a slower approach and were more vigilant while handling prey to avoid cub predation by lions and spotted hyenas. The ability of cheetahs to modify their prey handling behavior depending on the type of risk they face likely allows them to coexist with numerous larger carnivores."

We examined the spatial and ecological characteristics of predator encounters, as well as behavioral responses to perceived predation risk, in 5 groups of wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in Costa Rica over a 1.5-year period. Alarm-calling bouts directed at birds were more likely to originate in high forest strata, whereas alarm-calling bouts at snakes and terrestrial quadrupeds were more likely to originate near the ground. Relative risk maps based on the locations of predator encounters revealed that high-risk areas for birds and for all guilds combined consisted of more mature forest, whereas low-risk areas for these predators consisted of relatively younger forest. The animals were most vigilant near the ground, which may reflect greater perceived exposure to snakes and terrestrial predators in lower vertical levels. Incorporating the combined risk function into a predictive model of vigilance behavior improved prediction relative to null models of uniform risk or habitat-specific risk. Our results suggest that capuchin monkeys in this study system perceive reduced predation risk in the high and middle forest layers, and they adjust their vigilance behavior to small-scale spatial variation in perceived risk."
"OTTER, K",THE IMPACT OF POTENTIAL PREDATION UPON THE FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF EASTERN CHIPMUNKS,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE,72,1858,1861,10.1139/z94-252,1994,"Predation risk may have a profound impact upon foraging behaviour. I studied how potential exposure to predation affected the foraging behaviour of eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). I measured the time taken to approach a patch (''approach time''), the period of residency in the patch (''patch residence time''), the degree of vigilance, and the size of the load of seeds taken by chipmunks foraging at patches (food trays) in both open and forested sites. Chipmunks have shorter approach times to trays in the open than to trays amongst forest cover. Although the load size taken did not differ between the two sites, chipmunks had increased patch residence time in open patches versus covered patches, as a result of increased vigilance. As load size did not increase with patch residence time in the open patches, foraging in the open provides a lower gain rate than foraging in closed habitats. Chipmunks may require both patch types to maximize their cache of seeds for over-winter survival. Increased vigilance while foraging in open sites may decrease the risk of predation and allow chipmunks to utilize these patches. Thus, the loss in gain rate while foraging in open patches may be offset by the ability to use exposed patches to increase long-term survival."

We quantified how vigilance and flight behavior in mule deer Odocoileus hemionus varied with distance from an area of concentrated human activity-a subalpine field station. An observer walked trails at various distances away from the station looking for deer. Upon encounter, the observer walked toward the focal animal and noted the distance at which it alerted and directed its attention to the approaching human (Alert Distance; AD), and the distance at which it fled (Flight Initiation Distance; FID). AD and FID both increased nonlinearly with distance from the center of the field station, reaching plateaus around 250 m and 750 m, respectively. Deer also tended to flee by stotting or running, rather than by walking, when far from the station but they walked away when near the station. These results indicate that deer perceive lower risk near a focused area of human activity, and that vigilance and flight behaviors respond on somewhat different spatial scales. The concept of a spatial human footprint on behavior may be useful for understanding how human activities affect wildlife."

Advantages for the protected species are usually manifested in terms of higher reproductive success than conspecifics nesting remote to the protector species. Whether the protector species also accrues any benefit remains untested, and the species-specific behavioral traits underlying enhanced reproductive output in mixed-species associations remain poorly documented. We studied associations between lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni) and jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nesting in rural buildings in the Gela Plain (Italy). We tested for interspecific interactions of jackdaws and lesser kestrels by comparing single- and mixed-species colonies in terms of: 1) vigilance, nest attendance, and intra- and interspecific interference and 2) defensive responses shown by each species when confronted with potential predators or competitors. In both species, nesting in mixed associations was accompanied by decreased vigilance. Diminished vigilance, however, was associated with decreased defensive effort for lesser kestrels, whereas jackdaws increased alarm calling, but only in small colonies. Our results reveal a reciprocal influence on behavior of lesser kestrels and jackdaws nesting within the same colony, whereby both species experience decreased energetic expenditures associated with vigilance, but only lesser kestrels appear to benefit via reduced nest defense effort. We discuss our results in light of the possible asymmetrical information transfer triggered by a common set of nest predators that favors the exchange of interspecific information regarding predator detection and defense."

An inverse relationship between vigilance effort and group size has been documented frequently and thought to reflect the consequent decrease in perceived predation risk as group size increases. In contrast, competition costs are supposed to set the upper limit to the number of individuals that can forage together. As anti-predator behavior is no longer functional in the absence of predation and competition costs might be affected by resource distribution, the net benefit of aggregation will depend on the particular combination of predation risk and habitat structure experienced by the individual. To test this hypothesis, group-size effects on female time allocation and within-group aggression rate were compared between two guanaco populations exposed to contrasting levels of puma predation. Habitat structure within both sites consisted of mosaics of shrublands and grasslands, and group-size effects were also compared between these habitat types. Females under predation risk showed a strong reduction in vigilance as the number of adults in the group increased, whereas females from the predator-free population showed overall low levels of vigilance, regardless of group size. These results emphasize the anti-predator significance of the group-size effect on female vigilance, as well as guanaco plasticity to adjust time allocation to local conditions. On the other hand, within-group aggression rate increased with the number of adults in the group. Aggression rate was almost null within groups located in grasslands but was significantly higher in shrublands, regardless of predation risk, suggesting that the more heterogeneous distribution of shrubs increases the interference competition level. These results strengthen the notion of predation pressure and habitat structure as major determinants of the balance between costs and benefits of group living, and highlight the potential of individual behavioral patterns to make qualitative predictions about group-size variation within territorial ungulates."

Using giving-up densities (GUDs) paired with camera traps, we examined the concurrent influence of chronic road noise and predation risk on free-living small mammals. Specifically, we looked for differences in foraging and vigilance behavior during various noise treatments. We found that small mammals significantly reduced food intake when exposed to predation risk; however, concurrent exposure to road noise eliminated this effect; small mammals increased food intake when exposed to road noise and risk compared to risk alone. Furthermore, road noise reduced the number of visits and time spent at foraging trays while it increased vigilance behavior of small mammals in risky situations, meaning they were able to increase their foraging efficiency. Mice also ate less when moon illumination was greater; however, this had no effect on our overall results. This is one of the first studies to concurrently examine the effects of road noise and predation risk on free-living prey. It shows the complex responses of prey exposed to chronic noise conditions as they attempt to gain reliable information about predation risk and respond appropriately. We highlight the potential consequences road noise may have on the survival of prey as it interferes with their appropriate risk responses."

The time budgets of focal geese were recorded, and the effects of flock size on the proportions of time spent in vigilant and agonistic behaviour were tested. The results showed that the decline in vigilance level and consequent increase in foraging time were beneficial results of flocking whereas agonistic interactions, a potential cost of flocking, did not increase with increasing flock size. However, seasonal variation in flock size suggested that exploitative competition could be a cost of flocking; the sizes of flocks in spring, when resource depletion had progressed, were significantly reduced compared with those in autumn. An experimental increase in rice density resulted in a significant increase in flock size. We conclude that the flock size of foraging white-fronted geese is a result of compromise between a constant benefit of flocking (i.e. decline in vigilance level) and a cost of flocking varying with food abundance (i.e. exploitative competition)."

We found that when both members of a mated pair of Yellow-crowned Night-herons (Nyctanassa violacea) were at the nest they faced in opposite directions in 73% of observations, which was significantly more often than would be expected by chance (P < 0.0001, chi(2)(1) = 33.3). This behavior may improve vigilance against intruders from all directions. When an extra-pair conspecific was present at the nest of a mated pair, members of the pair were significantly more likely to orient in the same direction towards the conspecific rather than face opposite directions. In 95% of all cases in which an extra-pair conspecific was present, at least one member of the mated pair faced it, indicating that extra-pair conspecifics are perceived as threats by nesting pairs."

Mechanisms on increased boldness in urban animals,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,30,1583,1590,10.1093/beheco/arz117,2019,"Increased boldness is one of the most prevalent behavioral modifications seen in urban animals and is thought to be a coping response to anthropogenic environmental alterations. Most previous studies have shown enhanced boldness manifested as changes in responses to humans approaching, such as reductions in flight initiation distance (FID). However, this includes two confounding factors related to boldness, that is, reduction of vigilance and habituation to humans. Confounding these totally different processes could lead to our misunderstanding of urban adaptation and how to properly manage urban wildlife. Here, we propose a simple framework to separate the two processes using two flight distance measures toward different approaching threats. We considered that the distance at which targeted individuals noticed an approaching object (i.e., alert distance, AD) was related to vigilance, whereas FID represented risk assessment, which is related to habituation. We applied a predictive framework using AD and FID to Eurasian red squirrels' responses to multiple threats of different risk levels (i.e., humans, model predators, and novel objects). AD was shorter in urban individuals compared with rural ones but not different among the approaching objects. FID was shorter in urban individuals and also varied among the objects with the shortest FID toward humans, whereas rural individuals showed similar FID to the different objects. These results suggest that, although urban individuals showed reduced vigilance, they could still assess different risk levels. Our framework can easily be applied to many animals and could significantly improve our understanding of wild animals' adaptations to urban environments."

However, during field observations I witnessed a Rock Kestrel attack an adult CRJ, suggesting that Rock Kestrels may opportunistically prey upon CRJs. Further studies on site-and temporal-specificity in CRJs may lead to additional understanding of the flexibility of alarm calling in group-living species."

Observer distance was classified into four levels, i.e., <200 m, 200-300 m, 300-400 m and > 400 m. The results indicated that cranes increased their vigilance when the observer was less than 300 m away. A safe distance for the observer was often as far as or more than 300 m. Cranes increased scan frequency when observers were within 200 m, whereas they prolonged the duration of their scan when observers were between 200 m and 300 m away, indicating two distinct vigilant strategies, given the observer distance. We suggest an observer distance of at least 300 m, in order to minimize the observer effect."

Parasitic cuckoos can reduce the risk of their offspring being rejected by employing morphological and egg mimicry. Female common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) can deceive their hosts by mimicking sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) calls, thus improving brood parasitism success. However, few experiments have confirmed the hypothesis that female cuckoos can successfully mimic sparrowhawk calls. We used two populations of wild free-range chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), which are not cuckoo hosts, to study the effects of four different types of bird calls on their anti-predatory behavior. Results showed that both female cuckoo and sparrowhawk calls elicited vigilance and escape responses from chickens, while the chickens did not respond to either male common cuckoo or Oriental turtle dove (Streptopelia orientalis) calls. This suggests that female cuckoo calls can not only deceive their hosts, but also successfully deceive their non-host birds. Our study further confirms the accuracy with which female cuckoos can mimic sparrowhawk calls."

Observations on the vigilance behavior of Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) in Dongtan Nature Reserve of Chongming Island, Shanghai were conducted from January to February 2007 and from November 2007 to February 2008 by the methods of focus sampling and instantaneous scanning sampling. Results showed that the flock size of Hooded Crane affected both the scanning duration and vigilant individual percentage significantly (P < 0. 05). The scanning duration and vigilant individual percentage decreased with the increase of flock size. When the flock size was more than 90, the vigilant individual percentage dropped to its lowest value and kept stable with the flock size growing. The watching distance of Hooded Crane in farmland habitat was (408. 8 [plus or minus] 43.3) m, and that in tideland was ( 378. 6 [plus or minus] 32.5) m. There was a significant difference between the watching distances of Hooded Crane to human and motor transporters (P < 0.05).

However, because time allocated to vigilance reduces the amount of time that is available for energy acquisition, foraging in the face of predation can impose an evolutionary trade-off. Optimal foraging theory therefore predicts that risk-taking decisions should vary in response to perceived levels of threat. Our goal here is to disentangle the relative contributions of conspecific presence, ecological factors, and individual traits on two measures of vigilance in free-living California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi). This facultatively social and ecologically flexible rodent represents a major source of prey in California grasslands. Over a 5-year period, we collected 386 focal animal surveys on 156 free-living individuals residing at two colony sites. Individuals were most vigilant in conditions for which predation risk was highest, such as when foraging alone and on flat areas with low vegetative cover. In general, juvenile foragers were more gregarious but less vigilant than adult foragers. Although all animalsregardless of age or sexgenerally decreased their intensity of vigilance as group size increased, only adults decreased their time allocated to vigilance in response to conspecific presence. Thus, grouping consistently buffered the costs of foraging for risk-averse adults, but the benefits of conspecific presence were less salient for juveniles. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of context in shaping foraging decisions and offer insights into the suite of factors mediating decision-making in socially and ecologically variable environments.Significance statementAnimals face trade-offs when foraging in the face of predation, but the capacity for individuals to respond appropriately to subtle changes in context-dependent threats remains poorly understood. We studied antipredator vigilance by the California ground squirrel, a flexible species that may forage alone or in small groups of various sizes and in habitats that vary in their protective value from predators and the ease at which prey may detect predators. Although adults are more sensitive to changes in group size, all animals detected context-dependent danger to some extent. Our findings offer insights into the multiple factors that prey respond to when making foraging decisions, suggesting that animals possess the ability to integrate disparate sources of information about danger to optimize energy gain."

Effective general defenses, such as predator avoidance, decrease the likelihood that an individual is attacked and should therefore reduce selection on behaviors that enhance probability of escape on attack. Escape behaviors become important if animals cannot avoid attack. We investigated the relative effects of avoidance and escape enhancing behaviors on the survival of juvenile redshanks, Tringa totanus, over 2 winters. We predicted that avoidance behavior should be the primary behavioral correlate of survival, but when forced, by starvation risk, into areas where risk of attack is much higher, behaviors that reduce risk of capture once attacked should also promote survival. We found that reducing exposure to attack was most important for increasing survival and that increased vigilance and foraging success rate only increased survival for individuals that spent more time in high-risk areas. Use of the high-risk area and survival varied between years, suggesting that variation in starvation risk (i.e., colder winters) may provide a mechanism for selection on capture-reducing antipredation behaviors to be maintained because predator avoidance, the most effective antipredation behavior, is not then possible."

I especially focused on feeding.. brooding and vigilance behaviors. Feeding rate did not differ between males and females, but females spent more time at the nest than males. Females dedicated their time to brooding, while males perched on the nest and were vigilant. Both parents changed the feeding rate in relation to brood size, so the feeding rate per nestling was not different among nests of different brood size. Duration of brooding by females increased with decreasing brood size, suggesting that the Royama effect, the pattern of lower feeding rate per nestling in larger broods, did not apply in this study. Males spent more time on vigilance than females. Anti-predator vigilance by males should be important for nestling survival given the high predation pressure typical of this population. In conclusion, males provide considerable parental care probably to minimize nestling starvation and to avoid nest predation. My results are not consistent with the general pattern of less parental effort by males in monogamous, sexually dimorphic species."

In visually guided organisms, the prevalent view is that predators have large binocular visual fields and high acuity, whereas prey have wide lateral areas and low acuity, which could affect vigilance behaviour. We characterized the configuration of the visual system (visual fields, retinal topography, visual acuity) and vigilance behaviour (head movement rate) of two ground-foraging avian prey (white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys, California towhee, Pipilo crissalis) with laterally placed eyes. We found that the binocular field of both species (45 degrees) was actually wider than those of some of their avian predators. Both species also had a single retinal specialization (high ganglion cell density area) located in the centro-temporal sector of the retina, which projected into the lateral and frontal part of the head. Wide binocular fields may increase binocular contrast to detect and visually guide the bill towards prey items. Both species had wider lateral visual fields and faster head movement rates than some of their predators, probably to enhance detection and visual tracking of predators. California towhees made faster sideways movements of the head than did white-crowned sparrows, probably to cover visual space more quickly with their retinal specialization because of the comparatively lower spatial resolution of their retinal periphery. Alternatively, California towhees might move their heads more rapidly to monitor for potential risks (e. g. competitors, predators), as they rely mostly on personal information because of their degree of territoriality. Our findings suggest that the visual system and vigilance behaviour of these two avian prey species combine traits to enhance predator detection through large visual coverage and fast head movements, but also to enhance food detection at close range through enhanced binocular vision. 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We tested how multisensory stimuli affected the antipredator behavior of dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) using alarm calls as an auditory signal and flushing behavior as a visual cue. We varied the degree of risk within the group by manipulating the number of group mates alarm calling and/or flushing using robotic birds. We assumed that alarm calling and flushing were redundant stimuli and predicted that they could generate one of three types of responses (enhancement, equivalence, or antagonism) depending on the mechanism of multisensory perception. We set up an artificial flock with three robotic juncos surrounding a live junco and controlled for multiple confounding factors (e.g., identity of the focal, body mass, food deprivation time). We found that the degree of alarm of live juncos increased when at least one robot flushed. However, the time it took the live individuals to react to the robots' behavior increased, rather than decreased, with at least one alarm call. This could be the result of an orienting response or sensory overload, as live juncos increased scanning behavior after being exposed solely to alarm calls. Contrary to some theoretical assumptions, alarm calling and flushing behavior elicited independent unimodal responses, suggesting that they are non-redundant stimuli and that together they could reduce the occurrence of false alarms and facilitate flock cohesion."

However, actual field evidence supporting this assumption is scarce. This may be the result of the fact that most observations are conducted on social animals acting in the absence of an acute predation threat, yet the benefits of grouping come to the fore in that brief moment when an individual's life is at risk. As predation attempts are typically rare in nature, experimental manipulations are necessary to further explore the costs and benefits of social foraging. This study utilizes simple predator simulations (by humans) to experimentally test the predator-detecting abilities and escape strategies of groups of free-living emus Dromaius novaehollandiae . Emus in larger groups spent less time in vigilance and more time foraging. Nonetheless, the combined vigilance of group members ensured that emus detected the 'simulated predator' sooner as group size increased. After detecting the 'predator', larger groups waited longer until opting to flee, and then spent less time and energy doing so. Thus, the results of this study provide experimental evidence that emus benefit from grouping in terms of both the 'many-eyes effect' and the 'dilution effect'."

The risk allocation hypothesis extends the risky times hypothesis, noting that the context into which a period of risk or safety is imbedded should affect the level of response, and predicting that vigilance should be greatest during a brief pulse of risk and lowest during a brief pulse of safety. We tested these models using natural variation in true predation risk, by observing elk, Cervus elaphus, in the presence or absence of wolves, Canis lupus, on three sites in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, over 4 winters. Elk were exposed to wolves frequently in the Northern Range, intermittently in the Gallatin Canyon, and never in the Elk-horn Mountains. We used GLM to control the effects of herd size and composition while testing for responses of vigilance to daily wolf presence (temporal variation) and to site-specific, background levels of risk (spatial variation). The data gave strong support to the risk allocation hypothesis and equivocal support to the risky times hypothesis, and did not support the risky places hypothesis. Contrary to the risky places hypothesis but as predicted by risk allocation, Gallatin elk were more vigilant than Northern Range elk despite lower background risk in the Gallatin Canyon. The contradictory predictions of the risk allocation and risky places hypotheses have important rami. cations for research on the ecological consequences of antipredator behaviour.

Little research has been conducted on the behavioral responses of wildlife when encountering these novel structures over time. We used the installation of new wildlife road crossing structures built along a 6000-year old migration route to evaluate behavioral responses of long-distance migrators to the structures. We collected behavioral data during and after construction in order to evaluate individuals' immediate responses to these structures and to investigate how they changed over time using generalized linear mixed-effects models and generalized additive models fit by maximum likelihood. Pronghorn acclimated to the crossing structures and the frequency in which they successfully crossed them increased over time. The probability of pronghorn successfully crossing a structure was not influenced by human presence. Pronghorn spent more time in sustained vigilance behaviors after construction. Pronghorn also spent more time in sustained vigilance behaviors at relatively further distances from a structure and lead individuals spent more time in sustained vigilance behaviors than non-lead individuals. We did not detect any significant factors associated with stress behaviors. Pronghorn still demonstrated high sustained vigilance when approaching the structures after 20 months post construction, despite an increase in crossing success. While we found evidence of risk-avoidance behaviors in pronghorn at crossing structures, this work provides evidence that pronghorn gradually acclimated to wildlife crossing structures built in a historical migration corridor in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. We recommend using task completion chronology (rather than project completion dates) to install wildlife mitigation and we recommend using wildlife friendly fencing when fences are required for multiple use (e.g., cattle) at crossing structure entrances.

Variation in calls, either gradual or discrete, can inform potential mobbers about the situation. Great tits use a combinatorial call made of frequency-modulated elements (FMEs) and D notes. The gradual properties of the D notes change when facing different situations (e.g., different predators). We tested the relative effect of the number of D notes per call or the number of calls per minute on the behaviour of great tits with a playback experiment on free-ranging tits. Great tits did not change their approach behaviour depending on the treatments broadcast. However, they increased their vigilance level with an increased number of D notes in the total sequence. We propose that great tits can consider the overall amount of D notes as a form of information about the predator being mobbed. In addition, an increased number of D notes did not modify the approach behaviour but modified the vigilance behaviour, possibly indicating that great tits process the complete FME-D call as a whole mobbing unit rather than the simple sum of a vigilance call (FME) and a recruitment call (D notes). Our study sheds new light on the coding system of great tits when mobbing a predator and, more generally, how animals can combine simple syntactic rules and gradual variations when communicating. Significance statement Information transfer when communicating about a predator is well described, particularly when mobbing a predator. However, it is unclear which specific variable(s) receivers rely on when adapting their response. Here, we test whether great tits adapt their response when the number of calls per minute and/or the number of notes per call is increased. Our results indicate that great tits rely on the overall number of notes in a calling sequence as a proxy for urgency. We also propose that the combinatorial call they use when mobbing is considered a whole rather than the simple sum of its constituents. Understanding how information transfer occurs in birds using combinatorial calls instead of simple note repetition adds to the current insights about compositional syntax in animals."

This is the logical result of certain technological developments that occurred over the last two decades, allowing UAVs to be equipped with different types of sensors that can provide high-resolution data at relatively low prices. However, despite the success and extraordinary results achieved by the use of UAVs, traditional remote sensing platforms such as satellites continue to develop as well. Nowadays, satellites use sophisticated sensors providing data with increasingly improving spatial, temporal and radiometric resolutions. This is the case for the Sentinel-2 observation mission from the Copernicus Programme, which systematically acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolutions, with a revisiting period of five days. It therefore makes sense to think that, in some applications, satellite data may be used instead of UAV data, with all the associated benefits (extended coverage without the need to visit the area). In this study, Sentinel-2 time series data performances were evaluated in comparison with high-resolution UAV-based data, in an area affected by a fire, in 2017. Given the 10-m resolution of Sentinel-2 images, different spatial resolutions of the UAV-based data (0.25, 5 and 10 m) were used and compared to determine their similarities. The achieved results demonstrate the effectiveness of satellite data for post-fire monitoring, even at a local scale, as more cost-effective than UAV data. The Sentinel-2 results present a similar behavior to the UAV-based data for assessing burned areas."

The safe-habitat hypothesis explains this pattern through a decrease in the abundance of native predators, which reduces predation risk in urban habitats. However, this hypothesis does not consider the potential negative effects of human-associated disturbance (e.g., pedestrians, dogs, cats). Our goal was to assess the degree of perceived predation risk in house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) through field studies and semi-natural experiments in areas with different levels of urbanization using multiple indicators of risk (flock size, flight initiation distance, vigilance, and foraging behavior). Field studies showed that house finches in more urbanized habitats had a greater tendency to flock with an increase in population density and flushed at larger distances than in less urbanized habitats. In the semi-natural experiment, we found that individuals spent a greater proportion of time in the refuge patch and increased the instantaneous pecking rate in the more urbanized habitat with pedestrians probably to compensate for the lower amount of foraging time. Vigilance parameters were influenced in different ways depending on habitat type and distance to flock mates. Our results suggest that house finches may perceive highly urbanized habitats as more dangerous, despite the lower number of native predators. This could be due to the presence of human activities, which could increase risk or modify the ability to detect predators. House finches seem to adapt to the urban environment through different behavioral strategies that minimize risk."

Previous research on wild common ravens (Corvus corax) has shown that they react to the jackdaws' alarm call. We tested their responses to the heterospecific alarm calls of various bird species differing in familiarity and taxonomical relatedness to ravens. Two other corvid species (the blue jay Cyanocitta cristata and the European jay Garrulus glandarius) and two non-corvids (the black-headed gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus and the laughing gull Leucophaeus atricilla) were presented. We played back the tested alarm calls to free-ranging ravens at a feeding site and observed the ravens' responses to particular stimuli. We observed three behavioural responses made by the tested ravens: flying away, freezing (ceasing to move and crouching on the ground), and vigilance (observing the surroundings). The ravens responded to the Eurasian jay alarm call by freezing and flying away and to the blue jay alarm call by freezing and vigilance. The laughing gull alarm call induced mostly vigilance and the black-headed gull alarm call did not elicit any reaction. The responses to the alarm calls of both jays were similar to the responses to the playbacks of conspecific alarm calls, used as control (as well as to the response to a jackdaw alarm call from the previous study), which may point to the existence of a specific corvid characteristic in their alarm calls. The response to the alarm calls of both American species included vigilance, which suggests an uncertainty about the meaning of the call."

According to the results, for both orbits of the Sentinel-1, the horizontal displacement and the vertical displacement were observed in the range of - 10 to 6 mm. Compared to the magnitude of displacement signal measured by Sentinel-1, ALOS-2 data has higher values due to the high surface penetration of the L-band. The results showed that most of the old landslide regions are reactivated. Horizontal movement derived through Sentinel-1 showed that the highest movement overlaps with old landslides. L-band ALOS-2 provided better spatial coverage of landslide movement than C-band Sentinel-1 data, especially at the rural part along the coast of the lake."

In systems where predators regulate prey abundance, it is reasonable to assume that differential patterns of habitat use by prey species represent adaptive responses to spatial variation in predation. However, patterns of habitat use also reflect interspecific competition over habitat. Collared (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) and brown (Lemmus trimucronatus) lemmings represent such a system and possess distinct upland tundra versus mesic meadow habitat preferences consistent with interspecific competition. Yet, we do not know whether this habitat preference might also reflect differences in predation risk or whether the two species differ in their behavioral tactics used to avoid predation. We performed experiments where we manipulated putative predation risk perceived by lemmings by increasing protective cover in upland and meadow habitats while we recorded lemming activity and behavior. Both lemming species preferentially used cover more than open patches, but Dicrostonyx was more vigilant than Lemmus. Both species also constrained their activity to protective patches in upland and meadow habitats, but during different periods of the day. Use of cover and vigilance were independent of habitat, suggesting that both species live in a fearsome but flattened landscape of fear at Walker Bay (Nunavut, Canada), and that their habitat preference is a consequence of competition rather than predation risk. Future studies aiming to map the contours of fear in multi-prey-predator systems should consider how predation and competition interact to modify prey species' habitat preference, patch use, and vigilance."

After removal of Crested Tits Pants cristatus (the dominant species in mixed flocks), Willow Tits P montanus did not decrease their foraging heights as expected but remained in the most exposed parts of young pines. In contrast, after removal of Willow Tits, Crested Tits increased their foraging height from the sheltered lower canopy to sites previously occupied by Willow Tits. When flock size was reduced, the birds maintained the same high levels of vigilance without concealing themselves in dense vegetation. I suggest that flock members may benefit from foraging in sites that afford good anti-predator vigilance."

White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter deer) increase vigilance in response to coyote (Canis latrans) presence, but vigilance responses to spatiotemporal variation in coyote abundance are unknown. Therefore, we examined the relationship between deer foraging behavior and coyote abundance on two 2000-ha study areas in Georgia, USA, during 2010-2013. We used baited camera traps during fall and winter to quantify deer behavior (i.e., feeding or vigilant) and estimated coyote abundance using fecal genotyping to noninvasively mark and recapture individuals. During 2011 and 2012, coyote removals were implemented on each study area. Coyote abundance (i.e., predation risk) varied spatiotemporally and was a predictor of foraging behavior during at least one season for all sex-age classes of deer except juveniles. Adult males were more sensitive to predation risk in winter, after the breeding season, whereas adult females were sensitive to predation risk during both seasons, but more so during fall when offspring are at greater risk. Yearling males were more sensitive to predation risk than adult males, and juveniles were least sensitive to predation risk, likely because of inexperience and high energetic demands. Reproductive chronology explained sex-specific and seasonal antipredator responses to predation risk, but there was a non-linear relationship between indirect predator effects and direct predation risk for some sex-age classes. Our results suggest deer detect and respond behaviorally to variation in coyote abundance. Due to the widespread distribution of deer and their interactions at multiple trophic levels, the ecological implications of this finding may be wide-reaching."

Early predator detection and rapid anti-predatory action increase the likelihood of survival. We investigated how foraging affects predator detection and time to take-off in blue tits (Parus caeruleus) by subjecting them to a simulated raptor attack. To investigate the impact of body posture we compared birds feeding head-down with birds feeding head-up, but could not find any effect of posture on either time to detection or time to take-off. To investigate the impact of orientation we compared birds having their side towards the attacking predator with birds having their back towards it. Predator detection, but not time to take-off, was delayed when the back was oriented towards the predator. We also investigated the impact of foraging task by comparing birds that were either not foraging, foraging on chopped mealworms, or foraging on whole ones. Foraging on chopped mealworms did not delay detection compared to nonforaging showing that foraging does not always restrict vigilance. However, detection was delayed more than 150% when the birds were foraging on whole, live mealworms, which apparently demanded much attention and handling skill. Time to take-off was affected by foraging task in the same way as detection was. We show that when studying foraging and vigilance one must include the difficulty of the foraging task and prey orientation."

One cost of not fleeing is the ongoing cost of vigilance for upcoming environmental threats. Our results show that FID increases for vigilant hares with predator starting distance, due to the costs acquired by continuing to scan for ecological dangers. The presence of conspecifics within proximity distance for social hare was reduced FID due to collective vigilance, while a solitary animal had greater FID, due to less cooperative defense for predator detection. In both seasons, detection and flight initiation distance of the focal hare increased in open habitat due to a higher probability of detection for upcoming danger, while dense cover provided concealment but reduced the probability of detecting an incoming threat, reducing FID. Moreover, proximity to roads and the nearest refuge significantly influenced anti-predator risk by compensation energy to cope with approaching stimuli. In a landscape with heavy human hunting in retaliation to plantations damage has modified the natural behavior of the hare in the Shigar valley. The findings are discussed in the context of hare FID by humans and the suggestions for management and mitigation of human-wildlife conflict are also considered."

The parameters under study were Vigilance, Resting, Grooming, Defecation/Urination frequency, time spent together Male-Female, Grouping, Alone, Affinitive interaction, Agonistic activity, Mounting frequency and Mounting Number etc. Vigilance was significantly less in the captive population than wild population. Resting was noticed more in the captive population than wild population. Frequency of Mounting occurred more in the wild than in the captivity significantly. Grooming behaviour was non-significantly different between wild and captive population. Results of this study indicate that if captive population is kept with appropriate gender relation in an enclosure and environmental disturbance is minimum the captive Chinkara population can be as productive as the wild population."

However, knowledge about their potential impact on wildlife is scant, especially in Antarctica, where they are a new tool used in ecological research and monitoring.In this preliminary study potential effects of wildlife disturbance by fixed-wing UAVs are investigated. In austral summer 2014/15, UAV overflights were conducted in the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding colony at Point. Thomas (Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, Subarea 48.1). The impacts of electric and piston engine UAVs flying at 350 m altitude above ground level (AGL) over the colony were compared to the undisturbed colony (control group), and to natural disturbance (skua - Stercorarius sp. flying over nesting penguins). Penguin behaviour was divided into: resting behaviour, comfort behaviour, vigilance/anxiety and aggression. Percentages of birds exhibiting different types of behaviour, time spent on each type of behaviour and number of different types of behaviour displayed by one bird during the observation periods were compared. No differences were found between the control group and overflights by electric UAVs. During the overflight by a UAV powered by piston engine, symptoms of vigilance were observed with penguins looking up and around for a few seconds when the UAV was overhead. Similar symptoms of vigilance were observed when skuas flew (approximately 5 m AGL) over penguin colony without trying to attack nesting birds. No increase in aggressive behaviour was observed during the overflights by either electric or piston engine UAVs. Plans for a systematic monitoring of UAV impact on wildlife, as well as preliminary guidelines for the next field season, were formulated."

Pups first emerged from their natal burrows in late May. All individuals in the population, including all pups, were observed for 12 weeks following this emergence. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of ontogeny revealed considerable age differences. Upon first emergence, pups were extremely wary and spent most of their time vigilant and little time feeding. As pups aged, they increased time spent feeding and decreased time spent vigilant. Male and female pups behaved similarly. Pups differed from adults in their time allocation patterns and these differences changed as pups aged. Pups were initially more vigilant and fed less than adults, but became less vigilant than adults as the summer progressed. Yearlings behaved similarly to adults. Possible intrinsic (e.g., pup age and weight) and extrinsic (e.g., weather conditions, microhabitat location and coterie composition) influences on time allocation by pups were also examined. In general, extrinsic influences appeared to have more impact on pup behavior than intrinsic ones, suggesting that time allocation by pups may be largely context-dependent. Overall, the considerable number of age differences argues for more consideration of ontogeny in models of antipredator behavior."

The study was conducted in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, where the seals haul out onto newly exposed rocky ledges on falling tides. Initial scanning time of newly hauled-out harbour seals during the first 3 min after haul out decreased as group size increased. The scanning times of individual seals significantly decreased over time since haul out. Alternating observations (similar conditions for each pair of seals) showed that newly hauled-out seals scanned significantly longer than seals that were resident for over 30 min. Seals on the periphery of the group scanned significantly longer than those in the centre. Part of the scanning decrease of seals in larger groups was attributed to time since haul out and fewer animals being on the periphery of the group. The seals were 1.4 +/- 0.6 (SD) body lengths from the water's edge and 1.6 +/- 0.5 body lengths apart; 81% were oriented towards the water; this orientation and spacing allowed for ready access to the water. These behaviour patterns, and the high levels of vigilance, support an anti-predator function of harbour seal grouping on haul-out sites. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

While the vigilance eforaging conflict has been extensively investigated, other important fitness-related behaviours exclusive to scanning, such as grooming, have been overlooked. Yet, risk perception is expected to be more accurately assessed in these contexts as food-related parameters should not interfere. We studied individually recognizable impalas, Aepyceros melampus, and questioned the factors that shape maternal decision making in two exclusive components of maternal care with high benefits and costs: scanning for predators and grooming offspring to remove parasites. While studies generally infer prey alertness level, used as a proxy of risk perception, from the observed investment in vigilance, the vigilance eallogrooming context gave us the opportunity to directly assess alertness during the time spent head-up, and then to investigate its sources of variation and its consequences for allogrooming probability. We found a strong decrease in allogrooming probability when maternal alertness increased. Mothers were more alert in open (grassland) than in closed (bushland) habitats at a large scale. Increasing group size led both to lower maternal alertness and higher proportion of suckling time spent allogrooming, but only when surrounded by low vegetation, the reverse being true in high vegetation. Finally, mothers suckling female calves were more alert. Our results underline the determinant role of habitat, shaping both offspring predation risk and the relative conspicuousness or protective value of group mates. We discuss the potential fitness costs associated with the antipredatoreantiparasite trade-off faced during maternal care. Our results suggest that prey behaviours other than foraging are essential to identify factors shaping risk perception. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Habitat overlap between godwit males and Whimbrels was larger than intersexual overlap in the godwits. Observations of scanning behaviour of foraging godwits showed that the vigilance level of males was not affected by the presence or absence of their mates. Female vigilance levels, however, dropped significantly when females fed near their mate, and-in the absence of the mate-near Whimbrels. While female godwits benefited from associating with Whimbrels, males seemed to avoid close proximity to this species. Whimbrels chased godwit males more often than females, presumably because they used the same foraging habitats."

Here we apply behavioral indicators based on foraging theory to quantify the effect of tourists on the critically endangered Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana). Ibex are habituated to human presence in En Avdat National Park, Israel; nevertheless, they exhibit heightened wariness of humans especially during the kidding season or when far from escape terrain. We applied behavioral indicators through the measurement of giving-up-densities (GUD, the amount of food that a forager leaves behind in a resource patch) and vigilance behavior to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in the patch use behavior of Nubian ibex under the influence of tourism. We hypothesized that Nubian ibex should treat the presence of tourists in a similar matter to the risk of predation. Our results show that the impact of tourism on ibex significantly varied both temporally and spatially in response to tourist activity. In regard to the temporal variation, ibex had higher GUDs on weekends when tourist activity was high than on weekdays. Furthermore, ibex GUDs were highest in the habitat most frequented by tourists, but only at times of high tourist activity. In a second experiment, the presence of tourists in close proximity always caused Nubian ibex to increase their GUDs in resource patches, even on a steep slope. The spatial position of the tourists up slope or down slope from the ibex affected both GUDs and vigilance behavior. The response was especially sharp when the tourists disturbed ibex from up slope, blocking escape lines. Even for this apparently well-habituated population of ibex, tourist presence significantly increased foraging costs as revealed by behavioral indicators. This study demonstrates how applying methods from behavioral ecology to conservation problems allows access to useful information that may be difficult to obtain using other approaches."

However, guarding of mates can also occur during the nonfertile period, and the fitness benefits of this behavior are unclear. Male songbirds, for example, sometimes guard nonfertile females during foraging recesses from incubation. We hypothesized that guarding postreproductive mates may have important, but unrecognized, benefits by enhancing female foraging efficiency, thereby increasing time spent incubating eggs. We tested the hypothesis in 2 songbird species by examining female behavior during natural and experimentally induced absences of males. Male absence caused increased vigilance in foraging females that decreased their efficiency and resulted in less time spent incubating eggs. Male guarding of nonfertile females can thus provide a previously unrecognized form of indirect parental care."

A further benefit involves larger groups in which individuals may further decrease the amount of time spent being vigilant, while maintaining the probability of predator detection by allocation of this extra time to foraging activities. Living in groups or flocks, however, also incurs costs, e.g., by increasing inter-group competition, with negative impacts on intake rates. Our aim was to investigate the trade-offs between the costs of competition and the benefits of group living in contrasted habitats. For prey species that rely on sight for detecting predators, vegetation structure may influence the perceived predation risk. Hence, we experimentally examined the combined effects of vegetation height and inter-individual distance on foraging time, intake rate and foraging efficiency in a granivorous species, the Eurasian Skylark (Alauda arvensis). Our experimental results based on temporally captive birds indicate that time devoted to foraging decreased with increasing inter-individual distance, but was unrelated to cover height. Conversely, increasing both vegetation height and distance with other group members did translate into a foraging disadvantage, i.e. reduced intake rate as well as foraging efficiency. Overall, our results show that both vegetation structure and inter-individual distances modify patch profitability, and therefore provide another example of how flock dynamics can influence the trade-off between vigilance and foraging."

However, sudden departures are ambiguous because they can be triggered by factors unrelated to predator detection. We evaluated how animals react to the sudden departure of neighbours in groups of foraging house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We focussed on false alarms that occurred for no apparent reasons to us because predation attempts were not frequent. Three factors can explain how the sudden departure of a neighbour can influence reaction times, namely group size, the distance between neighbours, and predation risk. We predicted reaction times to be longer in larger groups where individual vigilance levels are low, and when group members are further apart and cannot easily monitor each other. In addition, we expected reaction times to be longer when predation risk is lower. Departures that are more temporally clumped are also expected to be less ambiguous and should trigger faster reaction times. Our results show that sparrows reacted faster, not more slowly, to the sudden departures of neighbours in larger groups, and, as predicted, more slowly when neighbours were more distant from each other. Reaction times were longer in one of the two study years in which predation risk was deemed lower. Sparrows reacted more quickly when earlier departures were more temporally clumped. The results thus provided partial support for the predictions, and future work is needed to assess how individuals react to fleeing responses by their neighbours in species with no alarm signals."

During 2008-2010 at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Plum Brook Station (Erie County, OH), we tested the hypotheses that visual obstruction of winter feeding stations would result in fewer white-tailed deer visiting treatment stations and increased vigilance exhibited relative to deer using control stations. When feeding stations were bounded on 3 sides by a 22.5-m-long, 1.5-m-high, continuous, polyethylene visual barrier (including a 5-m opening on the fourth side), and offset from the food resource by 22.5 m, we observed no differences in deer use or vigilance compared with control stations (4.5-cm mesh, snow fencing only). In a second experiment, feeding stations bounded by individual, 1.5-m-high, polyethylene visual barriers, positioned on 3 sides only and offset from the food resource by only 7.6 m each, were characterized by 1) fewer deer, 2) increased alert behavior (e.g., head held above horizontal, ears erect, body posture noticeably stiff and animal paused, directed attention, tail flagging, or fleeing) by deer using the stations, and 3) fewer deer using stations at night, relative to control stations. Visual barriers offset at most by 7.6 m from a food resource (e.g., crops), or located randomly within target areas frequented by deer can offer temporary and easily manipulated means of diminishing deer use of resources on unfenced General Aviation airports or depredation of agricultural crops, and ready integration with other management methods.

However, little is known about the way animals monitor conspecifics. We investigated the mechanism that European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, use to visually monitor group mates in perching situations through two questions. First, do starlings copy the timing of each other's vigilance? Second, do they use their centres of acute vision to monitor group mates? We studied a component of vigilance that has received relatively little attention, lateral scans, which consist of changes in the orientation of the head (i.e. gaze shifting) while in a head-up position. We found that starlings copied the timing of their neighbour's scans, placing them closer together in time than expected by chance. This could enhance the speed of social information spread within a group compared to random timing of head movements. The strength of this copying effect varied with neighbour distance and the sex of the follower and leader, suggesting that starlings appear to be more motivated to copy some individuals over others. Additionally, instead of monitoring neighbours with their centres of acute vision (high-quality vision), starlings tended to use their retinal periphery (low-acuity vision), potentially reducing the costs of social monitoring. Copying the timing of lateral scans may have advantages for gathering social information (i.e. quick responses to movements of group mates in situations such as murmurations). However, it can also have costs in terms of delaying the detection of personal information by any group member (e.g. predator attack) due to longer gaps without changes in gaze orientation. Therefore, copying the timing of lateral scans may be restricted to specific contexts (e.g. low predation risk). (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Lima, SL; Mitchell, WA; Roth, TC",Predators feeding on behaviourally responsive prey: some implications for classical models of optimal diet choice,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,5,1083,1102,,2003,"Hundreds of studies exist on predator foraging behaviour, and the same holds for anti-predator behaviour in prey. However. despite these many studies, almost nothing is known about diet choice by predators that feed on prey with anti-predator behaviour. We addressed this problem theoretically by incorporating anti-predator vigilance into two classical models of diet choice by predators. Vigilance allows prey to detect attack and escape. and prey become more vigilant as the predator focuses more of its attention on a specific prey type. We considered diet models in which predators encounter two types of prey either simultaneously (in mixed-type groups) or sequentially (solitary, randomly distributed prey). In both cases. anti-predator behaviour in prey causes predators to adopt a more generalized diet than one might predict on the basis of classical theory When prey are encountered simultaneously. increased dietary generalization by predators often reflects broad 'partial prey preferences'. Here, predators tend to attack both prey types some of the time rather than attack only one prey type all of the time (as suggested by classical theory). When prey are encountered sequentially, increased dietary generalization reflects mainly an increase in the threshold encounter rate necessary to cause the predator to drop the less profitable prey from the diet. However. when sequentially encountered prey require an investment in stalking time (which will be lost to the predator if the prey detects attack), partial preferences may hold over a large part of parameter space. Also possible under this stalking-time scenario is the reversal of prey preferences, in which the inherently less profitable prey is always preferred by the predator. These general deviations from the expectations of classical diet theory reflect. in part, the fact that predators faced with behaviourally responsive prey will often benefit from 'managing' the anti-predator responses of those prey."

Therefore, the behavioral activity patterns of Chital were studied in Kota Zoo, located in Kota, Rajasthan (India) to evaluate the influence of captive conditions on its 'natural behavior', which is essential to survive when released in natural habitat. This study concluded that Chital spend maximum time in feeding, which is followed by resting, social activity, movement, other activities (drinking, defecation, urination) and anti-predatory activity during day time. The vigilance responses were almost absent in captive spotted deer in the absence of danger signs, which are of utmost importance in natural habitat. Movement of Chital was restricted whereas social interactions were increased among closely associated animals in large herd owing to limited space in enclosure. Many factors of wild are absent in captivity and accordingly display different behavioral patterns."

We present the first study investigating the impact of wildlife tourism on African elephant, Loxodonta africana, behaviour. Over 15 months, we studied the effect of monthly tourist pressure (tourist numbers) on the occurrence of stress-related, vigilance and conspecific-directed aggressive behaviour in 26 individually identified elephants and the effect of up to three vehicles on the direction of travel of non-identified herds using 5-min continuous focal observations. We analysed the effect of tourist pressure and vehicle presence using generalized linear mixed models, including habitat type, herd type and size and season, as well as sex and age for behaviour models, as additional factors. We found no effect of factors on stress-related behaviour, but elephants were more likely to perform vigilance behaviours at waterholes compared to other habitat types. As tourist pressure increased, conspecific-directed aggression in elephants increased and male elephants were more likely to perform conspecific-directed aggression compared to female elephants. Furthermore, we found that elephant herds became increasingly likely to move away with increasing numbers of vehicles present. Results suggest that reserves should monitor elephant behaviour to identify when tourist pressure has potential effects on elephant welfare and train guides to monitor behaviour and adjust minimum distances flexibly to ensure high welfare standards and tourist safety. This study further contributes to a small but growing body of literature on non-consumptive wildlife tourism impacts on wild animals."

We documented naturally-occurring vigilance throughout ontogeny, and used playback experiments to evaluate age-related variation in hyenas' responses to control sounds or lion roars. We inquired whether juveniles respond to lions more cautiously than do adults. Naturalistic observations showed that juveniles are less vigilant than adults when no immediate threat is present, but more vigilant than adults when lions are present. Our playback experiments revealed that both adult and juvenile hyenas moved in response to lion roars but not to control sounds, and their reactions were stronger to roars emitted by male than female lions. However, juveniles showed a stronger response to lions than adults, as expressed by spending more time avoiding speakers after roar onset, and by having a shorter latency to first movement than adults. Like adults, juvenile hyenas, thus, appear to recognize certain signals as dangerous and respond accordingly. However, our data suggest that young hyenas may need experience with danger early in life to learn the environmental circumstances under which they ought to be vigilant when no threat is immediately apparent."

Coyotes (Canis latrans) recently expanded into the eastern United States, and raccoons (Procyon lotor) are a common mesocarnivore that potentially serve as competitors and food for coyotes. We used camera traps at baited sites to quantify vigilance behavior of feeding raccoons and used binomial logistic regression to analyze the effects of social and environmental factors. Additionally, we created raccoon and coyote activity patterns from the camera trap data by fitting density functions based on circular statistics and calculating the coefficient of overlap (Delta). Overall, raccoons were vigilant 46% of the time while foraging at baited sites. Raccoons were more vigilant during full moon and diurnal hours but less vigilant as group size increased and when other species were present. Raccoons and coyotes demonstrated nocturnal activity patterns, with coyotes more likely to be active during daylight hours. Overall, raccoons did not appear to exhibit high levels of vigilance. Activity pattern results provided further evidence that raccoons do not appear to fear coyotes, as both species were active at the same time and showed a high degree of overlap (Delta = 0.75) with little evidence of temporal segregation in activity. Thus, our study indicates that nonconsumptive effects of coyotes on raccoons are unlikely, which calls into question the ability of coyotes to initiate strong trophic cascades through some mesocarnivores."
"ROSA, SM; MURPHY, MT",TRADE-OFFS AND CONSTRAINTS ON EASTERN KINGBIRD PARENTAL CARE,WILSON BULLETIN,106,668,678,,1994,"Ten Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus) nests were observed for 97 h to determine age-related changes in parental care and to identify possible trade-offs and constraints on feeding, brooding, and vigilant behavior. Feeding rate (trips/h) was related positively to nestling age and brood size, but related negatively to amount of time spent vigilant. Per capita nestling feeding rates (trips/nestling/h) were affected most strongly and negatively by brood size, precipitation, and time spent vigilant. Time spent brooding declined as nestlings aged and as air temperature rose, whereas the amount of time spent shading nestlings varied only (inversely) with cloud cover. Vigilance time averaged about 20% of each hour, was independent of age and brood size, but was related negatively to amount of time spent in nestling maintenance (brooding plus shading), the number of feeding trips made to nests, and nest visibility. Weather had major influences on feeding and brooding behaviors, but regardless of other factors, kingbirds appear to reserve time for vigilance. Parental behavior thus reflects the action of a large number of factors that require compromises in the apportionment of time to the feeding, maintenance, and protection of young."

The Desert Puna of Argentina comprises two habitats: the shrub steppe and the vegas. The former, the most abundant habitat, is a topographically simple area with unavailable free water and poor food quality; the latter is a very scarce and topographically complex habitat and with water available year round and high quality food. Guanaco relies heavily on vision to detect predators and narrow and complex habitats would be risky. Hence, we expected that guanacos would use the vegas in lowest proportion and would increase the time devoted to vigilance. Guanacos spent more time in the shrub-steppe than in the vegas, where the highest percentage of vigilant guanacos was recorded. A positive and significant relationship between time devoted to foraging and number of animals per herd was observed in both habitats. In the shrub-steppe the opposite was observed for vigilance, whereas in the vegas, no relationship was observed. Despite the low availability of vegas and the high predation risk, they represent a critical habitat for guanacos in the Desert Puna, because they representing the only areas with free water available throughout year for wildlife.

Most research on responses to predation risk has come from studies on herbivore prey, whereas little research has focused on mesopredator behavioural responses to risk. We studied antipredator behaviours of mesopredator cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus, exposed to top predator risk from lions, Panthera leo, and leopards, Panthera pardus, by using a playback experiment to manipulate short-term predation risk in areas of differing long-term risk. We did not find support for the risky places hypothesis; cheetah vigilance was not influenced by longterm risk. On the contrary, we found support for the risky times hypothesis; cheetahs were more vigilant and more likely to flee following lion and leopard playbacks. Additionally, we did not find support for the risky times and risky places hypothesis or the predation risk allocation hypothesis; cheetah antipredator behaviours following a predator playback were not associated with long-term predation risk. Finally, cheetahs had higher baseline vigilance in areas of open vegetation but were more likely to flee from lion sounds in areas of dense vegetation and from leopards in areas of open vegetation. We highlight the importance of understanding spatial and temporal factors that influence mesopredator risk perception and show that antipredator behaviours can differ among trophic levels.

The shrimp rely on tactile and chemical cues from their goby partners to warn them of approaching predators. In return, the shrimp construct and maintain the burrows which provide shelter for the goby. Although aspects of this relationship have been well studied, less is known about the interdependence of the two species' activity patterns. We conducted field observations of an obligate shrimp-goby mutualism, Ctenogobiops feroculus and its common shrimp partner Alpheus djeddensis. We found that individual gobies were consistent in their activity levels relative to conspecifics over a 3-day period but were not consistent in terms of the time allocated to vigilance. Both the activity and the vigilance behaviour of the goby directly correlated with the behaviour of their shrimp partners; shrimp with a more active partner were themselves more active, and visibility of the shrimp increased as vigilance time increased. By quantifying the interactions between the two species, we have gained greater insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of these complex behavioural interactions."

Recent reviews of translocation science underline the need to monitor translocated individuals. We sought to quantify social integration within the resident population and acclimation to a new environment of translocated bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in a wild population in Alberta, Canada. We used precise metrics to evaluate post-release sociality, behavior and growth of translocated individuals. We observed a gradual assimilation of relocated sheep in the local population through increased social network centrality and decreased avoidance of residents. Translocated sheep spent more time vigilant and increased vigilance when forming groups with local residents. The initial social integration of translocated individuals involved high rates of received aggression. Translocated sheep gained 19% less mass than residents during the first summer following translocation. Females did not give birth until the third year following translocation. Our results suggest that translocated sheep required one year to acclimate to their new environment and socially integrate into the local population. This study provides empirical quantification of both social integration and temporal acclimation processes for population reinforcement programs of large mammals. It increases our understanding of post-release processes and will assist in evaluating future conservation actions."

However, by doing so males may face the associated costs of increased energetic expenditure, reduced foraging time, and elevated predation risk. We investigated the costs of display in lekking male Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus). We used lek-wide scan sampling to study how males allocated time among courtship display (dancing''), agonism, foraging, and inactivity in relation to female numbers both within and across days. We also addressed the limited attention hypothesis and estimated visual attentiveness by videotaping 13 males and scoring head turns during these different activities. We found that the proportion of males engaged in display increased significantly with female numbers both within and across days. Additionally, foraging decreased with increasing female numbers both within and across days. Our results also suggested that agonism increased on days of high female attendance after females had left the lek. Males turned their heads only half as frequently during display as during other activities. These correlative data suggest two mechanisms by which display costs are potentially incurred: 1) a reduction in on-lek foraging time, and 2) reduced visual attention to the surroundings. It is possible that reduced foraging time and reduced vigilance during display may also be costs of increased courtship display in other nonlekking species."

We investigated wild meerkat (Suricata suricatta) responses to DPCs by taking an experimental approach. When meerkats encounter a DPC they often recruit group members by emitting a call type, which causes the group members to interrupt foraging and approach the caller. The aim of this study was to identify the qualities of olfactory predator cues, which affect the strength of response by meerkats, and determine the benefits of responses to such cues. Experimental exposure to dog (Canis lupus) urine as a DPC revealed that the recruited individuals increased vigilance to fresh urine in comparison to older urine, whereas a higher quantity of urine did not induce such an effect. Both freshness and higher quantities increased the proportion of group members recruited. These results indicate that recruitment might play a crucial role in correctly assessing the current level of danger and that recruiting might facilitate group decision making. To test the prediction that the reaction to a DPC enhances early predator response, we presented a DPC of a predator and a control cue of a herbivore, and each time simultaneously moved a full-mounted caracal (Caracal caracal) in the vicinity of the group. Meerkats responded earlier to the caracal when the DPC was presented, indicating that the response to a DPC facilitates predator response and that they use information from the cue that reliably reflects the risk in the current moment."
HOGSTAD O,WINTER TERRITORIALITY AND THE ADVANTAGES OF SOCIAL FORAGING IN THE TREECREEPER CERTHIA-FAMILIARIS,Fauna Norvegica Series C Cinclus,13,57,64,,1990,"Six treecreepers (all probably males) were observed within non-overlapping ranges of 0.8-2.8 ha during November-March, indicating winter territoriality. Each of the treecreepers was observed singly in company with tits (Parus montanus, P. cristatus, P. ater) and Goldcrests Regulus regulus (pariform guild). Each responded to a playback of alarm calls from P. montanus and of contact calls from P. montanus and P. cristatus. The feeding efficiency of the treecreepers increased significantly with increasing number of guild members within a radius of 15 m, while vigilance decreased with increasing number of guild members within the same distance. It is suggested that the increased feeding rate is a result of less time devoted to vigilance, due to an increase in the degree of predator detection provided by the greater number of birds in the pariform flock. The effect of such combined vigilance of the guild members on the feeding efficiency of the associated treecreepers seemed to be independent of the species composition of the pariform guild. However, when associated with other species (Carduelis spinus, Loxia curvirostra, Pyrrhula pyrrhula), no effect on treecreeper feeding rate was observed."

To examine the applicability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for large areas, we propose an approach to determine rice age, date of planting (dop), and date of harvest (doh) using a time series of Sentinel-1 C-band in the entire Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The effect of the incidence angle of Sentinel-1 data on the backscatter pattern of paddy fields was reduced using the incidence angle normalization approach with an empirical model developed in this study. The time series was processed further to reduce noise with fast Fourier transform and smoothing filter. To evaluate and improve the accuracy of SAR data processing results, the classification outcomes were verified with field survey data through statistical metrics. The findings indicate that the Sentinel-1 images are particularly appropriate for rice age monitoring with R-2 = 0.92 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 7.3 days (n = 241) in comparison to in situ data. The proposed algorithm for estimating dop and doh also shows promising results with R-2 = 0.92 and RMSE = 6.2 days (n = 153) and R-2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 5.7 days (n = 88), respectively. The results have indicated the ability of using Sentinel-1 data to extract growth parameters involving rice age, planting and harvest dates. Information about rice age corresponding to the growth stages of rice fields is important for agricultural management and support the procurement and management of agricultural markets, limiting the negative effects on food security. The results showed that multitemporal Sentinel-1 data can be used to monitor the status of rice growth. Such monitoring system can assist many countries, especially in Asia, for managing agricultural land to ensure productivity. (C) The Authors.

A pair consisted of a male and female maintaining proximity (<10 m) without aggression, pairing behavior involved those behaviors exhibited during this interaction. Some of these behaviors were only observed during pairing. Males were responsible for maintaining proximity to females through repeated approaches and by monitoring their surroundings for the location or movement of the female (i.e., exhibiting vigilance). The incidences of some behaviors were significantly associated with others, specifically dorsal touches by males elicited tail-wagging by females. Tail-wagging probably facilitated the transmission of olfactory information about female receptivity. After tail-wagging the male was more likely to contact and sniff. Contacts, which occurred in every pairing event were positively correlated with sniffs and tail-wagging and might be used as an index of receptivity. Pairing behavior apparently generated a cost of reduced foraging time for males by increasing their vigilance levels."

We evaluated the extent of nest attention by males and estimated its effect on viability and survival of eggs. We assessed whether male absences during incubation were constrained to avoid embryos reaching lethal temperatures or to minimize risk of egg predation. We estimated (1) effect of nest attention on viability of eggs by comparing egg temperature in nests with and without male attention; and (2) effect of male care on egg predation, by comparing survival of eggs in nests with and without male care. Rhea males attended the eggs for 42 days, but effective incubation started 5-7 days after laying of the first egg. The proportion of time that males spent at the nest increased from 64% during egg laying (days 1-10) up to 97.5% during mid and late incubation (days 20-40). Male absences occurred at the warmest hours of the day and their lengths were positively correlated with the temperature of the environment. Male nest attention reduced the rate of egg losses and kept eggs above lower lethal temperatures for embryos during the night. We also estimated relative cost of parental care after hatching by comparing the time allocated to feeding and vigilance by males with chicks, males in nonreproductive groups, and nonreproductive solitary males. Males took care of the chicks for 4-6 months. They allocated less time to feeding and more time to vigilance than males in groups of adults or solitary males. Investment in vigilance decreased as chicks aged. Our results indicate that Greater Rhea males would require high levels of energetic reserves to start a breeding attempt. That high demand could explain why less than only 20% of the males attempt to nest during a breeding season."

To explore how prey species adjust their antipredator behavior in response to these predators, we measured giving-up densities (GUDs) in experimental feeding patches and time spent vigilant for greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), and warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) before and after an introduction of wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). Before the introduction, the only predators in the system were cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). After the release, none of the prey species changed their microhabitat preference, in that they all preferred open grasslands to mixed tree and bush-clumps and bush-clumps. However, kudu and sable fed more intensively (i.e., achieved lower GUDs) and had lower vigilance in open grasslands, while reducing their feeding effort (i.e., higher GUDs) and increasing their vigilance near denser vegetation. When the wild dogs denned in the study site, potentially increasing contact with the prey species, the time kudu spent vigilant and their GUDs increased significantly across all patches, and continued to increase over time. In contrast, sable and warthogs stopped feeding from the experimental patches altogether during this period. The change in feeding intensity and vigilance levels by kudu likely reflected an additive antipredator response to both cheetahs and wild dogs, whereas sable and warthogs only responded to the increased risk from the wild dogs. Our results indicate that the addition of wild dogs influenced the foraging-safety trade-off for the 3 prey species, but that the antipredator behaviors utilized by these species to mitigate predation risk varied within the newly established 2-predator system."

One factor that has received little consideration is illuminance. Social animals exploiting sunlit patches could image the sun on their retinas, restraining visual perception, and, as a result, the use of personal and social information. Our goal was to assess the effects of illuminance under different levels of predation risk by studying pairwise interactions in house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus. We manipulated predation risk levels (low and high) and illuminance (low and high), and recorded changes in patch use, scanning and foraging behaviour, food intake rate, and predator detection. We found that illuminance affected the behaviour of house finches, which (a) avoided sunlit patches, (b) changed vigilance behaviour under high illuminance by reducing scan bout duration, (c) reduced foraging attempts under high light conditions, although food intake was not affected, and (d) increased the latency to detect a predator attack when foraging in pairs under high light conditions and when conspecifics showed antipredator responses that were more difficult to detect visually. If personal and social information sources about predation risk are restricted in sunlit patches, animals might increase their perceived predation risk. We discuss alternative interpretations, such as higher predation risk in sunlit patches due to greater visual exposure to predators. We suggest that heterogeneity in light conditions should be considered an ecological factor affecting foraging and antipredator behaviour in groups.

Accurate information about immediate safety while foraging may be provided by the sentinel, a high-perched non-foraging Babbler that actively scans and warns for predators. We tested whether, at this migratory hotspot, the bewildering number and diversity of potential avian predators (perhaps more than anywhere else in the world) may be more than a reliable sentinel could handle. We monitored ten Babbler groups regularly for a number of hours per day throughout the migration season, and scored whether the Babblers gave alarm calls when different bird species were in sight. Analyses showed that Babblers are very skilled in distinguishing between species of high and low predation threat (interspecific threat-sensitivity). In addition, Babblers distinguished accurately between encounters with dangerous vs. harmless individuals from predator species of potentially high predation threat (intraspecific threat-sensitivity). Overall, Babblers cautiously overestimated predation threat, probably because errors involving alarms for harmless predators have a lower fitness cost than errors involving attacks by dangerous predators that are ignored. However, fewer warnings were given for the more common predators of lower threat, which suggests that Babblers initially overestimated the risk of predation, but subsequently learned to assess the level of threat more accurately as soon as more information was available. Overall, our findings agree closely with theoretical predictions regarding adaptive and sophisticated anti-predation behaviour in a variable world."

We investigate how the structural complexity of cover and group size affect perceived predation risk in goldfish (Carassius auratus) by measuring behaviors indicative of vigilance. Goldfish were videotaped in an aquarium while foraging on a saturated food patch near structurally complex protective cover (artificial plants) or structurally simple obstructive cover (solid blocks) in varying group sizes (three, six, or nine individuals). We measured the amount of time individuals spent foraging and their body position within the patch and their orientation (toward or away from cover). When foraging in the presence of obstructive cover, individuals from all group sizes spent more time on the side of the patch farthest from cover than close to it and oriented toward the cover. The presence of protective cover had no effect on the position or orientation of fish on the food patch for any group size. There was a nonsignificant trend for the proportion of time spent foraging increasing with group size for the obstructive cover treatment but it was independent of group size when fish fed near protective cover. These results indicate that goldfish do alter both their use of space and their orientation behaviors to offset the increased perceived predation risk produced by obstructive cover and that there is a significant effect of habitat structural complexity on the behavior of these fish."

Over 3years, we studied grouping behavior of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) families in Chilean Patagonia during the birthing season and determined their response to variation in predator occurrence and perceived predation risk (habitat structure, calf/adult rate, and density of conspecifics). We considered the effect of two predators, puma (Puma concolor) and culpeo fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). We measured two common (family group size and vigilance) and one novel (family group cohesion) behavioral responses of guanaco. Our results show that guanaco family groups adapted their grouping behavior to both predator occurrence and perceived predation risk. Larger family groups were found in open habitats and areas with high puma occurrence, while guanacos stayed in small family groups in areas with high shrub cover or low visibility. Group cohesion increased in areas with higher occurrence of pumas and culpeo foxes, and also increased in smaller family groups and in areas with low guanaco density. Vigilance (number of vigilant adults) was mainly related to group size and visibility, increasing in areas with low visibility, while residual vigilance (vigilance after removing the group-size effect) did not vary with the explanatory variables examined. Our results suggest that a mix of predator occurrence and perceived predation risk influences guanaco grouping behavior and highlights the importance of evaluating different antipredator responses together and considering all predator species in studies aimed at understanding ungulate behavior."

Conspecifics detecting these calls respond with increased vigilance, promoting predator detection and evasion, but in doing so, lose time from foraging. That loss can be minimized if alarm call recipients discriminate among signalers, and weight their response accordingly. For juvenile ground squirrels, we predicted that the trade-off between foraging and vigilance could be optimized via selective response to alarm calls emitted by their own dam, and/or neighboring colony members over calls broadcast by less familiar conspecifics. Alarm calls of adult female Richardson's ground squirrels were elicited in the field using a predator model and recorded on digital audio tape. Free-living focal juveniles were subjected to playbacks of a call of their mother, and on a separate occasion a call from either another adult female from their own colony, or an adult female from another colony. Neither immediate postural responses and escape behavior, nor the duration of vigilance manifested by juveniles differed with exposure to alarm calls of the three adult female signaler types. Thus, juveniles did not respond preferentially to alarm calls emitted by their mothers or colony members, likely reflecting the high cost of ignoring alarm signals where receivers have had limited opportunity to establish past signaler reliability [Current Zoology 58 (5): 773-780, 2012]."

Life history theory predicts that the amount of time allocated to vital behaviours will change with life history stage, resulting in trade-offs between competing behaviours. Moreover, a range of environmental factors can also affect activity budgets. We studied diurnal time allocation by migratory plains zebras (Equus quagga) in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, and investigated the effect of life history stage, social environment, habitat structure, and day time on time allocation to five behavioural categories (grazing, resting, vigilance, movement, other). We expected (1) increased vulnerability to predation and impeded predator detection to increase vigilance and decrease resting and grazing; (2) energetically costly life stages to increase grazing and decrease resting; and (3) increasing age in young to result in increased vigilance and grazing and decreased resting. Our findings revealed that in young zebras, resting decreased and grazing increased from the youngest to the oldest age class. Band stallions spent more time grazing and less time resting and moving than bachelors. Lactating mares devoted more time to grazing but less to resting and vigilance than other mares. Mares spent most time vigilant in the last third and stallions in the first third of the day. Adult zebras moved more, and mares were more vigilant in the woodland boundary than on short grass plains. Taken together, our study identifies intrinsic and extrinsic factors shaping time allocation decisions and trade-offs between competing behaviours in plains zebra."

Ad lib and applied focal animal sampling were successfully conducted using advanced visual night sights to span a 24-hour period with foraging, vigilance and 'other' as behavioural categories. Vegetation sampling provided evidence of differences between gully and field observations according to sex. Weather conditions appeared to have little impact on behaviour. Sika deer showed reduced vigilance behaviour at night and human disturbance caused them to flee on 50% of the occasions."

With global climate change, expanding shipping routes, and increasing industrial development in theArctic, the polar bear (Ursusmaritimus) faces newchallenges to its survival. Polar bear behavioral response to vessel presence is not well-documented. During the 2008-2014 Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program (CSESP), polar bear occurrence and behavioral data were collected during summer-autumn vessel surveys. We examined polar bear occurrence and behavioral response to vessel presence by distance. During this study, 56,901 km of observation effort occurred from 3 survey vessels and 42 groups (50 individuals) of polar bears were recorded. Over half of the groups exhibited a behavioral response (i.e., vigilance or flee) including all groups of mothers with cubs. The mean distance at which bears responded to vessels (805 +/- 648 m) was closer than the mean distance at which no response was observed (2,001 +/- 1,368 m). Logistic regression analysis revealed that response was associated with distance and our model indicated the estimated distance at which 50% of the polar bears would exhibit a behavioral response to be 1,645 m. Our findings are relevant to assess potential impacts of increasing vessel activity in the Arctic and to assist in the development of effective monitoring and mitigation strategies for polar bears."

Delimitation was accomplished using 106 girdled sentinel trees and management included girdling 18 clusters of trees as population sinks to attract EAB and concentrate larvae for removal. Weekly monitoring of traps hung in sentinel trees facilitated early detection of EAB on 12 trees and allowed deployment of additional sentinels and sinks. Sentinel trees were felled and debarked; 12 were positive for EAB larvae and the spatial extent of infestation estimated at similar to 48 km(2). Sinks nearest the infestation core had the highest numbers of larvae. Larval densities were significantly greater in girdled trees than in proximate ungirdled trees suggesting removal of girdled trees prior to the following year's emergence would lower local EAB densities. Sinks deployed in response to an EAB on a sentinel tree purple prism trap more than 0.6 km from the centre of the known infestation were negative for EAB indicating these would not be effective for managing an infestation of similar size and in similar habitats. This case study provides valuable information to land managers to facilitate delimitation and management of newly discovered EAB infestations."

Collective detection in mixed flocks of emberizid sparrows, however, is an ambiguous and uncertain process. In these flocks, detectors of attack impart little information directly to their flockmates. Non-detectors infer the possibility of an approaching threat based upon the occurrence of departures from the flock, and appear unable to distinguish non-threat-induced departures from those induced by an approaching threat. Under such circumstances, theory suggests that multiple detections of attack (or multiple departures) may be required to incite alarm in the flock. Experiments demonstrated such an effect: multiple threat-induced departures over a short time interval had a markedly greater effect on the escape behaviour of non-detectors than did single threat-induced departures. The effect of departures was moderated by their environmental context. Non-detectors responded more readily to departures that (1) originated from the outer portion of the flock, or (2) occurred when feeding far from protective cover. These sparrows also showed a range of behavioural responses to departures, from no response, to alertness, to immediate, full-blown escape. This ambiguous, departure-based form of collective detection implies that individuals must rely considerably on personal vigilance to detect predatory attack. Such a reliance may leave animals more vigilant than suggested by models of vigilance based upon the conventional version of collective detection.

Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the wild are notably aggressive towards outgroup members but coordinate complex behaviors with many individuals in group hunting and border patrols. One hypothesis claims that these behaviors evolve alongside one another, where outgroup threat selects for ingroup cohesion and group coordination. To test this hypothesis, 5 groups of chimpanzees (N = 29 individuals) were observed after hearing either pant-hoots of unfamiliar wild chimpanzees or control crow vocalizations both in their typical daily environment and in a context of induced feeding competition. We observed a behavioral pattern that was consistent both with increased stress and vigilance (self-directed behaviors increased, play decreased, rest decreased) and increased ingroup cohesion (interindividual proximity decreased, aggression over food decreased, and play during feeding competition increased). These results support the hypothesis that outgroup threat elicits ingroup tolerance in chimpanzees. This suggests that in chimpanzees, like humans, competition between groups fosters group cohesion."

This widely replicated effect has generally been explained in terms of distinct predator detection and risk-dilution effects. We show that a strict distinction between detection and dilution disappears when information about attacks is imperfectly shared (as it is in reality). Furthermore, dilution and detection effects change depending on when during an attack the predator targets a particular prey individual for pursuit. Realistic detection and dilution effects probably interact with each other and also with the targeting behaviour of predators. Instead of considering detection and dilution effects on vigilance, it may be more profitable to consider each prey's probability of being targeted during an attack and its probability of escaping if attacked. This perspective emphasizes that a full understanding of safety in numbers requires an understanding of predator targeting strategies."

Two nonfunctional hypotheses were tested: (1) groups arise from a shortage of haul-out sites or space on sites; and (2) terrestrial groups are extensions of groups formed in the water for reasons not related to hauling-out. Aerial surveys of haul-out site use by seals indicated that sites were not in short supply. Observations of the use of space on one haul-out site suggested that space on sites was not limiting. Arrivals and departures of seals at one study showed that groups formed at the haul-out site and disbanded after the haul-out period. The hypothesis that grouping functions to increase the probability of predator detection was tested by measuring individual and group vigilance relative to group size, and simulating predator attacks in the field. Although individual vigilance decreased with increasing group size, group vigilance increased. Larger groups detected 'attacks' at greater distances and a solitary seal failed to detect an 'attack'. It is proposed that an individual increases its probabiliy of detecting a predator by joining a group."

We predicted that accepter species parasitized infrequently would be found to be more vigilant at their nests during this time than accepter species more heavily parasitized. During our watches we observed seven acts of parasitism, all between 03:44 CST (sunrise - 44 min) and 4:00 CST (sunrise - 25 min). We found no correlation between frequency of parasitism of accepter hosts and nest attentiveness. There was no significant difference between accepters and rejecters in early-morning vigilance. However, females of all species that roosted on their nests were more likely to be present during the critical period for parasitism than females that did not roost. Individuals that did not roost first arrived at their nests, on average, after cowbirds presumably would have arrived to lay and this difference was significant in six species. We suggest roosting on the nest may place the host in the best position to guard against parasitism, although this behavior does not always prevent parasitism."

Recently, advances in technology have made it possible to extend behavioral assessment to the field environment. One of the first devices to measure human behavior in the field was the wrist-worn actigraph. This device, now widely employed, can acquire minute-by-minute information on an individual's level of motor activity. Actigraphs can, with reasonable accuracy, distinguish sleep from waking, the most critical and basic aspect of human behavior. However, rapid technologic advances have provided the opportunity to collect much more information from fully ambulatory humans. Our laboratory has developed a series of wrist-worn devices, which are not much larger then a watch, which can assess simple and choice reaction time, vigilance and memory. In addition, the devices can concurrently assess motor activity with much greater temporal resolution then the standard actigraph. Furthermore, they continuously monitor multiple environmental variables including temperature, humidity. sound and light. We have employed these monitors during training and simulated military operations to collect information that would typically be unavailable under such circumstances. In this paper we will describe various versions of the vigilance monitor and how each successive version extended the capabilities of the device. Samples of data from several studies are presented, included studies conducted in harsh field environments during simulated infantry assaults, a Marine Corps Officer training course and mechanized infantry (Stryker) operations. The monitors have been useful for documenting environmental conditions experienced by wearers, studying patterns of sleep and activity and examining the effects of nutritional manipulations on warfighter performance."

Direct and indirect costs due to geo-hazards are currently rising, causing serious socio-economics and casualty losses. Therefore, creating a priority list turns out to be essential to highlight the most relevant ground deformations and to better focus risk management practices at regional scale. The Sentinel-1 constellation, thanks to the 6-days repeatability and the free availability of the data, allows to easily update the geo-hazard-induced ground motions, compared to other kind of satellite sensors. In this work, a hot-spot-like method is presented by filtering a large stack of Sentinel-1 images processed by means of the SqueeSAR algorithm. Three periods, with six months repetitiveness, have been analysed in order to evaluate the behaviour and evolution of deformation clusters. The target area is Tuscany Region, located in the central part of Italy and affected by a wide gamma of geohazards, ranging from landslides to large subsidence areas. The final output is a geo-database of ground motions that can be used by regional authorities to prioritize and to effectively plan local risk reduction actions."

The German Aerospace Center supported the radiometric and polarimetric calibration of Sentinel-1A by the analysis of point target responses of several acquisitions considering different modes, beams, and polarization channels. An elevation dependent bias, which had not been properly predicted by the used antenna model, was found for all investigated modes. Offsets of up to 2 dB were determined during the SAR instrument calibration phase, in particular, for low and high elevation angles. Therefore, in order to correct these elevation biases, a radiometric refinement was carried out by European Space Agency in November 2015. After that, Sentinel-1A radiometric accuracy and long-term stability were analyzed over a period of 1.5 years. For this period, the absolute calibration factor and the channel imbalance were determined for the main imaging mode. Moreover, a slight drift of the derived calibration factor was observed starting from July 2016. At the same time an anomaly was detected in the front-end affecting several transmit and receive modules in one tile. The radiometric behavior of Sentinel-1A should therefore be monitored for a longer period of time, especially to detect potential degradation effects of the SAR instrument."

The mutually beneficial reciprocity between infants' and parents' behaviors is conserved across mammalian species. Although some studies highlight similarities in responses to infant cries across gender, other studies report differences in their behaviors and brain activity. Zeifman and colleagues in this Special Issue found that high levels of infant crying can trigger increases in testosterone in men, which is accompanied by less sensitive caregiving. Some interpret males' lack of sensitive caregiving as neglectful, but these results could be considered as evolutionarily adaptive. Specifically, increases in testosterone levels from intense infant cries could lead to increased vigilance and alertness toward external stimuli, and thus allow males to be better equipped to protect their young."

Time devoted to foraging decreased as vigilance (time devoted to being alert) increased. Variations in vigilance were explained by beach, reproductive stage, brood size, time of day, and number of people nearby. Overall, Piping Plovers foraged from 46-79 sec., were alert for 14-57 sec., and displayed or ran from people for 1-8 sec. in the 2 min. samples. Plovers at sites less disturbed by people (Little Beach, Holgate) generally devoted more time to foraging and less time to vigilance than birds at the other sites. Time devoted to foraging was generally higher in May, lower in June, and increased again in July. Plovers that were incubating or caring for chicks spent less time foraging than those that had lost their chicks. Chicks spent less time foraging and more time being alert, running, and crouching than did their parents foraging during the same time periods. With increasing brood size, chicks spent less time foraging and more time running or crouching although the number of people nearby did not vary. Behavior was correlated within members of a pair: birds spent less time foraging as their mates increased time devoted to alertness, being off the nest, or displaying. When brooding birds increased alert time, their mates increased their alertness and displaying, and decreased foraging time. As the number of people near foraging plovers increased, time devoted to running and crouching increased and time devoted to feeding decreased. It appears that the presence of people is stressful for breeding adults and chicks, forcing them to spend significantly less time foraging, perhaps accounting for decreased overall reproductive success."

Only the presentation of a stuffed cat induced a significant response. The adult males in particular increased their scanning rate and all adult individuals decreased their rate of vocalizations. The results indicate that visual scanning in marmosets is an appropriate measure of vigilance which seems to serve the function of predator detection and avoidance. The strong response of adult males suggests that they play a special role in predator detection."

The present results indicate that the way in which individual grosbeaks are positioned with respect to one another affects many aspects of their behaviour, especially when a nock contains four or more birds. Birds in a linear array which have difficulty seeing one another, when compared with individuals organized in a circle which can easily see one another: 1. are more vigilant; 2. change their head and body positions more often; 3. react to changes in group size more slowly; 4. show less coordination in head movements; and 5. show more variability in all measures. These differences in behaviour can be explained from a cognitive ethological perspective that favours intentional or representational explanations. Specifically, the data suggest that individual grosbeaks, when scanning and moving about, are visually monitoring the flock in which they are feeding and gathering information about a number of variables including flock size, what others are doing, where others are, which individuals are present, phenotypic features of nock members, food resources, or the location of potential predators. Individuals likely use visual records of the behaviour and perhaps the phenotypic features of others, and this information influences various aspects of their behaviour."

Understanding the relative effect of predator exposure and intraspecific interactions across a variety of anti-predator behaviors provides important insight into inter- and intra-specific drivers of species-specific behaviors. We merged classical behavioral observation methods with camera trapping techniques to examine anti-predator behaviors of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) relative to variation in predator exposure and interspecific interactions. We coded 772 behavioral observations from >180 000 images spanning 605 trap-nights. Seasonal differences in behavioral responses to diminishing returns on foraging effort indicated that deer are risk-averse foragers and are more likely to exhibit risky behaviors in the presence of a concentrated food resource when the nutritional value of food resources are high. However, deer tended to spend less time at a site as resources diminished, supporting marginal value theories of habitat use. Intraspecific interaction predicted vigilance and the amount of time spent at a site. Similar to many other species, deer tended to be less vigilant and spend more time at a site as group size increased. Our research suggests that white-tailed deer in Wisconsin make foraging decisions based on factors associated with individual fitness, presence of conspecifics, and habitat characteristics."
"Benkman, CW","Feeding behavior, flock-size dynamics, and variation in sexual selection in crossbills",AUK,114,163,178,10.2307/4089158,1997,"I present field data on feeding and scanning behavior of White-winged Crossbills (Loxia leucoptera) in relation to flock size. Feeding rates increased and individual levels of vigilance decreased as flock size increased from one to two. Further increases in flock size did not correspond with substantial reductions in individual vigilance, but did correspond with frequent agonistic interactions. As rates of agonistic interactions increased, feeding rates of subordinate age-sex classes (e.g. adult females) declined relative to those of dominant age-sex classes (e.g. adult males). Females (and immatures) may have reduced this effect by avoiding flocks composed mostly of adult males. Assortative flocking occurred in the nonbreeding period (late November to December), but during breeding periods (September and potentially rest of year) the numbers of each age-sex class tended to be positively correlated. Rates of agonistic interactions were higher when crossbills foraged on conifers whose cones were compactly dispersed. Flocks were smaller when rates of agonistic interactions were high and conifers had compact cone dispersions. Flock size increased as seed density declined. Larger flocks, with high levels of collective vigilance, were favored because feeding rate and the time spent scanning while seeds were husked also declined. Crossbills (Loxia spp.) that forage on small-crowned conifers are more sexually dichromatic and have other traits indicating stronger sexual selection than crossbills that forage on large-crowned conifers. I suggest that these differences result from differences in rates of agonistic interactions, which influence female feeding rates compared with male feeding rates, and likely have a differential effect on female mortality rates and the population sex ratio."

Examining competition for carrion in a risk-reward framework allows for a better understanding of how predator guilds compete for and benefit from carrion. We used trail camera data to compare wintertime carrion use and vigilance behavior of four carnivores in Denali National Park and Preserve. We found that carrion use was dominated by wolves (Canis lupus) and wolverines (Gulo gulo), followed by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and coyotes (Canis latrans). Wolves and wolverines were twice as likely to visit a carcass as foxes and coyotes, and their visits were longer and more numerous. Our results suggest scavenging animals reduced their risk exposure primarily by reducing their use of carrion, with some evidence of increased vigilance at busy sites. We found that carrion use and behavior at carcass sites were influenced by the mortality type of the carcass, the age of the carcass, and the long-term intensity of wolf use in the area. Our results also suggest that wolves are the top scavenger, and indicate that intraguild competition for carrion strongly affects which species benefit from carrion, with larger and more aggressive species dominating."

Increasing knowledge of the factors driving variations in shorebird numbers, phenotype and behaviour may allow shorebirds to serve as 'integrative sentinels' of global environmental change. On the basis of numbers, timing of migration, plumage status and body mass, shorebirds could indicate whether ecological and climate systems are generally intact and stable at hemispheric scales, or whether parts of these systems might be changing. To develop this concept, we briefly review the worldwide shorebird migration systems before examining how local weather and global climatic features affect several performance measures of long-distance migrants. What do variations in numbers, phenotype and behaviour tell us about the dependence of shorebirds on weather and climate? How does data on migrating shorebirds integrate global environmental information? Documenting the dependencies between the population processes of shorebirds and global environmental features may be an important step towards assessing the likely effects of projected climate change. In the meantime we can develop the use of aspects of shorebird life histories on large spatial and temporal scales to assay global environmental change."

Whether the returning large carnivores will modify ungulate behavior and indirectly affect lower trophic levels, depends on the ability of ungulates to recognize risk based on past encounters and cues indicating carnivore presence. In two case studies, we tested, by means of camera trapping, the behavioral response of deer to wolf urine. The first case study was in the Netherlands where deer (still) live in absence of wolves, and the second in Poland with long-term wolf presence. As controls we used water (no scent) and all-purpose soap (unfamiliar scent). Deer vigilance level on control plots was 20% in both case studies indicating that wolf occupancy per se does not lead to a consistent difference in behavior. Placing wolf urine did not significantly affect deer behavior in either the wolf-absent or the wolf-present area. More intense cues, or a combination of cues, are likely needed to affect deer behavior. Moreover, we found an unexpected reaction of deer towards all-purpose soap of reduced foraging (and tendency for increased vigilance) in the wolf-present area, whereas it did not affect deer behavior in the wolf-absent area. We hypothesize that deer associate all-purpose soap with human presence, causing no response in human-dominated landscapes (the Netherlands), but triggering a behavioral reaction in more remote areas (Poland). This illustrates attention should be paid to controls used in scent experiments as they may be associated differently than intended."

Greater rheas are threatened South American birds; habitat loss, predation and hunting are the main factors responsible for population declines. The study was conducted in farmlands within a matrix of commercial Eucalyptus plantation and remnants of natural habitats of cerrado vegetation (savannah-like) in southeastern Brazil. Rhea groups were located visually in different habitats visited monthly from January 2004 to December 2005. Time spent searching greater rheas in each habitat was equally distributed. Data were collected using scan sampling with instantaneous recording of behaviours every minute. The time-activity budget of greater rheas was influenced by habitat structure, time of the day, season and group size. Rheas spent more time in open areas than in forested areas (p < 0.001). Vigilance behaviours were more displayed in forested areas, in the dry season and by solitary and small groups of birds. Resting behaviours occurred more often in open lands and within groups with more than three rheas. Food availability, good visibility and low human presence are the possible factors for the preference of greater rheas for pasturelands. The results support the resource availability hypothesis, where it is expected that habitats with a higher food availability will be more used by the animals, group size hypothesis, where the scarcity of resources will lead to smaller groups of animals and that forestry modifies greater rheas habitat use and behaviours."
"Blank, David A.",Grooming behavior in goitered gazelles: the programmed versus stimulus-driven hypothesis,ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,,,,10.1080/03949370.2021.2015449,2022,"Self-grooming is the most commonly observed behavior and serves numerous functions, with the removal of ectoparasites likely the most important. According to a predominant conception, grooming is regulated by two mechanisms: a programmed-grooming model and a stimulus-driven model. The programmed-grooming model predicts, first, that smaller body-size females must groom more frequently compared to larger males (body-size principle); second, the smaller young groom significantly more often than adults (developmental grooming); and third, rutting males, busy with social vigilance, groom significantly less often than females (vigilance principle). The impact of molting was also tested on the grooming rate as an additional hypothesis that is not a part of the programmed-grooming model. According to investigations of a wide variety of ungulates in captive and natural conditions, the predictions of the programmed-grooming mechanism were found to be accurate for most sexually dimorphic ungulates. Here, I tested the principles of the programmed-grooming model in free living, wild goitered gazelles (Gazella subgutturosa), which are parasitized by both keds and ticks. My study found the following: (a) the body-size principle was not supported by my data, especially during the gazelles' molting and rutting periods; (b) the developmental grooming model did not relate to the grooming behavior of goitered gazelle fawns; (c) the vigilance principle was not applicable to male goitered gazelles; and (d) spring molting increased the grooming rate drastically for both males and females and likely had the greatest effect over any other factor, even though keds also contributed to the grooming rate at this time. Though previous studies of tick parasitism on many ungulate species demonstrated that oral grooming was more consistent with programmed-grooming than the stimulus-driven grooming model, my study of ked parasitism of goitered gazelles showed the opposite, suggesting that grooming driven mechanisms were parasite-host dependent. However, grooming behavior is likely a multifaceted phenomenon depending not only on body size, vigilance rate or even from ectoparasite burden, but also on numerous other factors."

However, among resource defense systems, ecological determinants of the variation in male reproductive effort are less understood. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of the effort devoted to territorial defense by male guanacos and how this is affected by predation risk. Time allocation to different activities and displays of aggressive behavior were compared between territorial and bachelor male guanacos within two populations with contrasting levels of predation risk. Territorial males devoted almost twice the time than bachelors to vigilance and moving, at the expense of foraging time. Aggressive interactions were more frequent and severe for territorial males than for bachelors, based on observation. These differences were larger during the reproductive season but remained statistically significant after this period, highlighting the extended effort towards territorial defense beyond the peak of reproductive activity. In contrast to previous observations on females of the same populations, there was no effect of predation risk level or group size on male time allocation, suggesting that under the ecological conditions of the study, intra-sexual competition entails a stronger influence on male individual behavior than predation risk level."
"Rowcliffe, JM; Pettifor, RA; Black, JM",Modelling the dynamics of winter barnacle goose flocks: A progress report,RESEARCH ON ARCTIC GEESE,,195,201,,1998,"Models of foraging behaviour in animals can help us understand the distribution of individuals across the available resources and hence to predict the likely effects of changes in conditions on population size. Models of this kind are well developed for cases where individuals interfere with each other's ability to forage effectively by reducing intake rate at high density, or alternatively where there is no direct interaction between conspecifics. However, although the movement of geese within and between flocks is affected by dominance interactions, they do not show classical interference. These models therefore cannot adequately describe the foraging dynamics of flocking geese. This paper describes the development of a novel approach to this problem, based on a trade-off between the vigilance benefits and the depletion costs of feeding in larger flocks. The need for this development is discussed in relation to the fundamental characteristics of goose flocks which distinguish them from other foraging systems. The approach is placed in the context of a broader project modelling the year-round dynamics of the Svalbard barnacle goose population from the perspective of individual behaviour."
"Luo, Jinming; Wang, Yongjie; Yang, Fan; Liu, Zhijun",Effects of human disturbance on the Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) at stopover sites in northeastern China.,Chinese Birds,3,206,216,,2012,"There is a lack of information of whether the behavior pattern and physical condition of the Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) have been limited by conditions encountered at stopover sites in Changgou village, which is adjacent to Zhalong Nature Reserve in northeastern China, one of the most important stopover sites of this crane. The objective of our research was to investigate the impact of human-caused disturbances on the Hooded Cranes. We investigated three behavior activities of the Hooded Cranes, i.e., flying time, flushing distance and the duration of vigilance. The results indicate that the auditory stimuli caused by local people provoked the most pronounced disturbances to the Hooded Crane. Human-caused disturbances not only frequently interrupt the feeding process of the cranes, but also lead to an increase of 200% in the duration of their vigilance and a significant increase in flying time from 0.4 to 0.7 h (p < 0.05). In addition, high-intensity noise can cause larger flushing distances; foraging cranes will flush away by about 600 m when disturbed by the honking of vehicles. Whistles or shouts by local farmers in the field generated the largest sound intensity, about 120 dB, which caused a flushing distance of over 700 m. In order to reduce the negative effect of human-caused disturbances on these cranes, it is imperative to define a buffer zone around sensitive areas during the fall stopover period. To solve the conflict between the interest of farmers and the demand for crops on the part of the cranes requires financial compensation to the farmers for the crops consumed by the Hooded Crane in order to enhance the conservation of this vulnerable bird species."
"Gendall, Jemma; Lill, Alan; Beckman, Juliey",Tolerance of disturbance by humans in long-time resident and recent colonist urban doves.,Avian Research,6,5,5,,2015,"Background: A critical trait for successful urban dwelling by birds is the ability to tolerate high levels of disturbing stimulation by humans. If such tolerance is partly acquired gradually after colonization, species with a long history of residence in cities are likely to be more tolerant of such stimulation than recent urban colonists, but this has not often been tested. Methods: We tested whether introduced Rock (Columba livia) and Spotted (Streptopelis chinensis) Doves, historically long-term residents of Melbourne, Australia, were more tolerant of disturbance by humans than the very recent colonist, the native Crested Pigeon (Ochyphaps lophotes) by comparing the Flight Initiation Distances (FID) and time allocations to vigilance during foraging of all three species in urban Melbourne. That all three species are members of the Columbiformes reduces the possibility that any species differences in tolerance are simply phylogenetic in origin. Results: Flight initiation distance was shorter in Rock Doves than in the other two species, which did not differ in approachability by a human. Rock Doves retreated from an approaching human mainly by walking a relatively short distance, Crested Pigeons mainly by running a relatively short distance and Spotted Doves primarily by flying a comparatively long distance. The time allocation to anti-predator vigilance of Rock Doves was smaller than that of the other two species, whose allocations were similar. Conclusions: The very recent colonist of eastern Melbourne, the Crested Pigeon, was not the least tolerant of disturbance by humans of the three related species. Natural selection for tolerance therefore probably cannot entirely explain the pattern of tolerance evident among these urban dove species and behavioural flexibility is probably involved. Length of residency in a city is not an infallible guide to a species' level of tolerance of disturbance by humans."

Within a given drainage, elk of both sexes moved into or closer to protective cover (timber) in response to wolf presence. Cow elk responded to elevated risk by increasing vigilance in exchange for foraging, and large mixed (cow, calf, spike) herds substantially decreased in size. In contrast, when wolves were present, bulls did not increase vigilance levels, or decrease feeding, and small bull-only groups slightly increased in size. As a consequence, small bull-only herds and large mixed-sex herds converged on a similar size when wolves were present. We think this response is a balancing of the benefits of risk dilution with increased detectability or attractiveness of larger herds to wolves. Based on proportions in the population, wolves overselected bulls and underselected cows as prey. Thus, bulls showed weaker antipredator responses than cows, despite facing a greater risk of predation. Using marrow fat content from elk killed by wolves as an indicator of body condition, bulls were in significantly worse body condition than cows throughout the winter, and condition deteriorated for both sexes as winter progressed. Overall, we conclude that antipredator behaviours carry substantial foraging costs, that bulls, because of their poorer body condition, are less able to pay these costs than cows, and that differences in ability to pay foraging costs probably explain sex-specific differences in antipredator behaviours.

"Mercier, Hugo",How Gullible Are We? A Review of the Evidence From Psychology and Social Science,REVIEW OF GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY,21,103,122,10.1037/gpr0000111,2017,"A long tradition of scholarship, from ancient Greece to Marxism or some contemporary social psychology, portrays humans as strongly gullible-wont to accept harmful messages by being unduly deferent. However, if humans are reasonably well adapted, they should not be strongly gullible: they should be vigilant toward communicated information. Evidence from experimental psychology reveals that humans are equipped with well-functioning mechanisms of epistemic vigilance. They check the plausibility of messages against their background beliefs, calibrate their trust as a function of the source's competence and benevolence, and critically evaluate arguments offered to them. Even if humans are equipped with well-functioning mechanisms of epistemic vigilance, an adaptive lag might render them gullible in the face of new challenges, from clever marketing to omnipresent propaganda. I review evidence from different cultural domains often taken as proof of strong gullibility: religion, demagoguery, propaganda, political campaigns, advertising, erroneous medical beliefs, and rumors. Converging evidence reveals that communication is much less influential than often believed-that religious proselytizing, propaganda, advertising, and so forth are generally not very effective at changing people's minds. Beliefs that lead to costly behavior are even less likely to be accepted. Finally, it is also argued that most cases of acceptance of misguided communicated information do not stem from undue deference, but from a fit between the communicated information and the audience's preexisting beliefs."

Often documented in studies of vigilance by animals foraging gregariously, this effect describes how individual group members are able to reduce their attention to environmental cues (e.g. predators) as group size increases, since the group can pool information from multiple individuals. Despite extensive literature in one context (foraging-vigilance), it remains unclear whether this effect can be observed in other contexts where animals face different informational demands (e.g. navigation). Using a custom-made sensor combining head-mounted inertial measurement unit and back-mounted GPS, we examined head movement, a proxy for visual scanning behaviour, in homing pigeons, Columba livia, flying alone, in pairs and in flocks (ca. 10 individuals). Individual birds' head movements decreased sharply when they switched from solo to paired flights and again when they switched from paired to flock flights. Homing efficiency (or route straightness) did not decrease in parallel with decreasing head movement but continued to increase over repeated flights. We also found systematic individual differences during flock homing flights, where birds positioned more frontally and more centrally in the flock made larger head movements. Moreover, leaders were positioned more frontally and tended to show larger head movements than followers. Decreased head movement by peripheral birds suggested increased attention to the rest of the flock rather than increased individual vigilance (contra 'the edge effect'). Overall, our results suggest that individual birds reduced their visual scanning during navigation because of the need to attend closely to fellow flock members to maintain flock cohesion. While reduced per capita visual scanning may reduce the amount of environmental information available to individual birds, it is likely to be compensated by the flock's collective attention.

The new theory attempts to account for several key findings, including the discrepancy between low self-reported anxiety and high behavioural and physiological indicators of anxiety shown by individuals with a repressive coping style. According to the theory, repressors have an initial rapid vigilant response triggering behavioural and physiological responses and involving attentional and interpretive biases to self-relevant threat stimuli. These biases may be based on negative self-relevant schematic information. This initial vigilant stage is followed by an avoidance stage involving avoidant cognitive biases (attentional, interpretive, and memory) that inhibit the conscious experience of anxiety. Future research should examine systematically the time course of repressors' reactions to threatening and non-threatening stimuli."

Yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, ground-dwelling sciurid rodents, produce individually distinctive alarm calls. Using an habituation-recovery playback protocol, we show that marmots can perceive differences between the calls of different adult females. We further show that marmots are able to discriminate between at least one broad age-sex category. In contrast to what has been reported in other species, playback of calls from juveniles elicited a greater response (i.e. marmots increased vigilance and suppressed foraging) than did playback of calls from adult females. No other age-sex category led to responses significantly different from adult females. Future studies will seek to understand why individual discriminative abilities exist, but we have shown that individuals are able to identify when young, and presumably vulnerable, marmots are calling, and to respond by engaging in vigilance.

Although this alert distance has been studied before, no consideration has been devoted to the relationship between vigilance behavior and the probabilities of detecting pedestrians. Our goal was to test whether and how differences in scanning behavior of two model species (spot-winged pigeon and eared dove) would affect the predicted and observed probabilities of detection of pedestrian approaches in two conditions: individuals foraging alone and in flocks. Overall, we found differences between species and between foraging conditions, but no interaction effects. Spot-winged pigeons and individuals foraging alone spent more time scanning, with longer scanning bout duration, than eared doves and individuals foraging in groups, respectively. Spot-winged pigeons showed greater alert distances (observed detection probabilities) than eared doves, and so did solitary individuals as compared to individuals foraging in groups. Greater scanning time may have increased predicted and observed detection probabilities of spot-winged pigeons. Expected probabilities of detection of pedestrian approaches were higher for group than for solitary foraging conditions, contrary to observed alert distances, probably due to a lack of collective detection in flocks. Our results suggest that vigilance behavior can affect the distance at which birds detect human disturbance and the estimation of tolerance. This behavioral effect could have implications in management scenarios (e.g. determining buffer areas), as similar levels of human visitation to protected areas may exert different effects according to the probabilities of detecting visitors within the detection windows of different species.

Because the evolutionary advantage of this behaviour is generally unknown, we used controlled group size manipulations within an aviary to investigate whether group size influences (1) the time that the covey spends feeding, (2) the percentage of the covey that is vigilant, (3) the overall vigilance of the group and (4) the time to predator detection. We found that increasing group size increased the time that coveys spent in an exposed feeding area, reduced individual vigilance, improved group vigilance and decreased the time to detection of a potential predator. Additionally, we used experimental reductions of wild northern bobwhite coveys to test whether groups size influences (1) individual and covey survival, (2) daily movement in maintaining covey size and (3) mass change. We conducted field research on 12 independent 259-ha study areas (6 control plots and 6 treatments, where 60% of the population was removed) in east-central Kansas, U.S.A. between 9 November and 31 January, 1997-2000. We radio-marked 386 radiocollared individuals that comprised 137 groups on the study areas. Covey size did not differ between or within years or treatments ((X) over bar +/- SE: 10.98 +/- 0.22 individuals). Our results indicate that a stable group size existed between I and 22 individuals, with 11 being an optimal group size. Small coveys (1-7 individuals) had lower group persistence and individual survival, and used increased movement to create or join larger groups where survival was higher. Large groups (15-22) had lower individual survival, increased group movement and individual mass loss. Density-dependent feedbacks (e.g. lower survival and increased competition) may have lowered larger coveys to a stable size. Our results suggest the regulation of an optimal covey size of 11 was promoted by high group persistence, low group movement, improved feeding efficiency, improved individual predator detection and improved individual survival.

Since 1992, recovery efforts for the endangered Great Lakes piping plover population have included captive rearing, but released young have lower survival than wild plover chicks. We tested the hypothesis that captive-reared chicks lack the ability to recognize predators by using visual and auditory stimuli. Vocalizations of predators and non-predators were combined with parental alarm calls, predator silhouettes, and a control to test for vigilant responses in captive-reared chicks prior to release. We tested for increases in average percent time spent on vigilant behaviors associated with exposure to predator and non-predator stimuli using linear mixed models. Chicks exhibited the greatest increase in vigilance when a treatment was combined with a parental alarm, regardless of whether the treatment was a predator or non-predator. Compared to white noise, average vigilance increased from 1.7% to 21.9% during non-predator treatments (95% CI: 8.0-34.2%) and to 78.3% during predator treatments (95% CI: 65.7-91.1%), indicating that chicks innately recognize avian predators as threatening. Average vigilance increased by 56.4% during predator treatments compared to non-predator treatments (95% CI: 49.8-64.8%), but individuals did not appear to differentiate between specific predators or non-predators. Our results provide strong evidence that captive-reared chicks innately recognize avian predators, which suggests that decreased post-release survival in captive-reared piping plovers is most likely caused by some other captivity-induced difference or by the lack of a parentally-taught behavior.

We examined seasonal home range and daily activity patterns of the endangered Swayne's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei) in Maze National Park, Ethiopia. We tracked two groups of Swayne's hartebeests in open grassland for 1 year. Each group's daily activities (0700-1900 h) and GPS locations were recorded at 15-min intervals on 5 days every month. Activities were grouped into five behavioral categories: feeding, resting, traveling, vigilance, and other. In addition, we carried out nocturnal monitoring during full moon periods to further document movements patterns. We produced 95% and 50% kernel density estimates (KDE) of home range sizes for each group. Home range estimates did not vary across seasons. Feeding and traveling peaked during the early morning and late afternoon, whereas resting occurred most frequently during the midday hours in both seasons. The proportion of time spent feeding was higher during the dry season, whereas a greater proportion of time was spent resting during the wet season. Vigilance behavior occurred consistently throughout the day during both seasons. Time spent feeding and traveling did not vary significantly between seasons. Activity patterns of Swayne's hartebeests are strongly influenced both by time of day and season, while home range size is less influenced by seasonality and may instead reflect temporal variation in food availability. Our findings will help to inform management strategies and conserve one of the last two extant populations of Swayne's hartebeests."

O.; Elvidge, Chris K.; Jackson, Christopher D.; Chivers, Douglas P.; Brown, Grant E.",The responses of prey fish to temporal variation in predation risk: sensory habituation or risk assessment?,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,21,532,536,10.1093/beheco/arq023,2010,"Predation is an important selection pressure acting on prey behavior. Although numerous studies have shown that when predation risk is high, prey tend to increase vigilance and reduce foraging effort, until recently, few studies have looked at how temporal patterns of risk influence the trade-off between foraging and antipredator behavior. The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey should respond strongly to predators that are usually absent, as they can meet their energy demands during safe periods. In contrast, if predators are almost always present, prey need to forage actively even though predators are present, a counter-intuitive prediction for many behavioral ecologists. This decrease in antipredator behavior on increasing exposure to risk has thus far been attributed to sensory habituation. Using cichlids, we show that sensory habituation is likely not the proximate explanation for the reduction in antipredator behaviors in this system. Such responses may rather be the result of adaptive decision making."

A standardized test with large carnivore and ungulate guilds in three ecosystems,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,232,164,172,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.02.012,2019,"If access to food is affected by the risk of predation, then the number of individuals killed by predators is an incomplete measure of the limiting effect of predation. Nonetheless, it is often assumed that the costs of anti predator responses (risk effects) are either small enough to be ignored or positively correlated with direct predation, and thus unlikely to alter inferences based on predation rates. These assumptions are rarely tested. Here we studied five large carnivores and ten prey species in three Zambian ecosystems to test relationships between direct predation, antipredator vigilance and trade-offs with foraging. The presence of a predator caused vigilance to increase by a factor of 2.4, with substantial variation among prey species in the strength of this response. This was associated with a 28% decrease in the proportion of individuals foraging, a trade-off that was consistent across species. We detected no correlation between direct predation and the strength of antipredator responses, which undermines the gambit of ignoring risk effects. The strength of antipredator responses was uncorrelated with broad attributes of predators and environments, but was correlated with attributes of prey. Responses were stronger for small species and for browsers/mixed feeders relative to grazers. It has previously been noted that small ungulates face higher rates of direct predation. Building on this inference, our results suggest that carnivore loss/restoration will also have stronger behaviorally-mediated effects on small ungulates, particularly browsers and mixed feeders. If such species increase their representation where carnivores are depleted, then cascading effects on vegetation would be expected."

We investigated interactions between coyotes, Canis latrans, and recolonizing wolves at ungulate carcasses in Montana's Madison Range. We used a field-experimental study design consisting of a two-level carcass treatment (wolf presence, wolf absence) to assess factors influencing coyote risk assessment, carrion consumption and aggressive encounters with wolves. Socially dominant coyotes (alphas and betas) responded to wolf presence by increasing the proportion of time spent vigilant while scavenging. Vigilance behaviour was more pronounced when scavenging closer to structurally complex vegetation where lateral occlusion inhibited the ability of coyotes to scan for, and possibly escape from, returning wolves. Despite greater time spent vigilant, alpha coyotes consumed the greatest amount of carrion biomass by feeding on carcasses in earlier stages of consumption when organs and large muscle tissues were still present. This finding suggests that alpha coyotes might trade off greater risk for higher-quality food items. Coyotes would aggressively confront wolves: numerical advantage by coyotes and the stage of carcass consumption were influential in determining whether coyotes were able to displace wolves from carcasses. Coyotes relied on a gradient of risk-sensitive behaviours, ranging from elevated vigilance to aggressive confrontation, to manage risk associated with wolf presence. Identification of these behaviours, and their sensitivity to numeric and social factors, is an important step in elucidating mechanisms of resource partitioning in social canids.

We expected higher bite rates and vigilance in lactating females with young and higher bite rates in young growing individuals, than in non-reproducing females or rams. Lactating ewes had higher bite rates than yeld ewes and than subadult or adult rams. Subadult rams had higher bite rates than adult rams or yeld ewes. On recently burned grassland in spring, however, rams had a higher bite rate than adult females, while the contrary was true on control plots and on the burned plots in autumn. Bite rates declined for both ewes and rams from April to September and varied from year to year. While rams of different ages had significantly different bite rates, there was no effect of age on bite rates for ewes. There was no correlation between bite rates and available total biomass or biomass of live vegetation, or the numbers of steps taken while foraging for either ewes or rams. Adult rams had a lower vigilance rate than adult ewes, and vigilance decreased with increasing bite rates for all sheep. Bite rates in bighorn sheep vary greatly according to age, season and vegetation structure. An increase in bite rates during the forage growing season may compensate for higher energy demands during lactation and growth. There is a potential trade-off between foraging and vigilance as vigilance decreased with increasing bite rates."

If beneficial, social relationships may reduce predation risk and thus increase an individual's sense of security. We tested this hypothesis by studying the responses of female yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) to broadcast alarm calls from unfamiliar individuals. First, we quantified affiliative interactions of animals in the field to calculate a set of social network measures. Because attributes of sociality are often correlated, we used principal component analysis to reduce our social network metrics to two unrelated factors and used the social network measure that accounted for the most variance for each principal component in further analyses. We then quantified the change in time allocated to vigilance and foraging following alarm call playback from baseline levels to the first 30 s and the second 30 s period (i.e., 31-60 s) following playback. We expected that if marmots with strong affiliative relationships felt more secure, they would forage more and allocate less time to vigilance after their immediate vigilance response to the broadcast alarm calls. Using mixed effects models that controlled for variation explained by a number of biologically important covariates and permutation tests to test the significance of social network variables, we found that marmots with a higher incloseness allocated significantly more time to vigilance in both the first and second 30 s after hearing a novel alarm call. Additionally, and while not significant (the observed parameter estimate fell between the 90 and 95% CI), marmots with a higher outstrength increased foraging in the second 30 s after hearing a novel alarmcall. If we assume that time allocated to foraging is a measure of security, then marmots with strong affiliative relationships reacted more to an alarm call from a novel individual and seemingly felt more secure than their counterparts. Our results, therefore, suggest that strong social relationships increase perceptions of security and illustrate an effect of social relationships on predation risk assessment.Significance statementIn many species, including humans, there are benefits from maintaining good social relationships. These benefits include better health and greater longevity. We studied yellow-bellied marmots, a ground-dwelling squirrel that is notable because it has variable social relationships. Capitalizing on this social variation, we found that marmots that maintain strong affiliative relationships with other marmots may indeed forage more after hearing an artificially broadcast alarm call than marmots with weaker affiliative relationships. This result suggests that marmots that are more socially connected with others in their group may feel relatively more secure, possibly because they have others that can help them assess risk, and that a benefit of maintaining strong friendly social ties is that it permits animals to forage more. Thus, we suggest a new way that social relationships can be beneficial: they increase perceptions of security and this ultimatelymay facilitate foraging."
"Thiollay, Jean-Marc",Comparative foraging behavior between solitary and flocking insectivores in a neotropical forest: Does vulnerability matter?,Ornitologia Neotropical,14,47,65,,2003,"Mixed-species flocks of insectivorous birds are a common feature of tropical forests. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain this social behavior: feeding enhancement and antipredator defense. This paper points out the comparative foraging behavior and habitat selection of flocking vs solitary species, to assess whether their respective vulnerability to predators could be related to their flocking propensity. When birds are foraging, their major components of vulnerability are their conspicuousness, their degree of vigilance and the protection or concealment provided by the surrounding vegetation. I selected the 37 most common and representative insectivores of a primary Neotropical rain forest understory and divided them into three equal groups according to their flocking propensity. During 944 continuous > 1-min feeding bouts, I measured the detectability and vigilance of individual birds. Compared to solitary foragers or occasional flock participants, obligate flock members were more detectable, less vigilant, and more likely to be susceptible to attacks by stalking predators. They used more active foraging techniques that were both less compatible with sustained vigilance and made them more conspicuous. They also used less protective substrates and the more risky mid-level of open understory. Such foraging sites looked neither open enough to allow a safe radius of detection and escape, nor dense enough to provide inaccessibility, concealment, or refuge. The results suggested that the apparent vulnerability to predation of at least obligate flock members may be a determinant, more than a mere consequence, of their flocking behavior. Flocking may afford the antipredator protection necessary for them to use safely enough their risky foraging behaviors and habitats. In short, solitary foragers would have relatively safe foraging sites and behaviors, compared to obligate flock species which should forage in flocks to retain their risky behavioral syndrome, while facultative attendants may have intermediate or adaptable behaviors and thus derive variable, but not essential benefits from joining flocks."

Studies of noise pollution show a wide range of effects on birds, such as alterations in communication, parental behaviour, physiology and reproductive success. These human-induced changes are likely to have long-term impacts, such as altered nestling physiology and survival, as well as reduced local population size. Further experimental field studies that simultaneously investigate the effects of noise exposure on avian behaviour, physiology and reproductive success are needed. Here, we used an experimental field study to investigate impacts of short-term traffic noise exposure on parental behaviour (i.e. vigilance and feeding rate), nestling body size and oxidative stress (as measured by oxidative status) and nestling fledging success in tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor. Our results show negative consequences of traffic noise exposure, despite a relatively modest playback regime (6 h, every other day). Adults in noise-exposed territories were less vigilant earlier in the nestling period and fed at a higher rate later in the nestling period, compared to controls. However, increased feeding rate in noise-exposed nests did not compensate for noise impacts on nestlings: noise-exposed nestlings were smaller and had higher oxidative status, compared to control nestlings. Noise-exposed nestlings took longer to fledge, but we found no effect of noise on fledging success. These results highlight the potential long-term consequences of short-term noise exposure (decreased nestling size and increased oxidative status) and add to a growing body of literature, showing that noise pollution can negatively impact birds through both direct and indirect pathways.

In these species the possibility that direct benefits other than paternal care may play an important role in the evolution of female choice has received little attention. I tested whether direct benefits are associated with female choice in the polygamous feral fowl, Gallus g. domesticus, where females prefer socially dominant copulation partners and males do not care for the young but do provide females with three commodities: food, vigilance, and sperm. I used a combination of empirical and experimental data to show that male propensity to offer food and vigilance, but not sperm, was positively associated with male social status, suggesting that the provision of these resources may be costly and condition dependent in males. Copulation success was correlated with male status but not with the number of feedings a female received from a male, indicating that a female preferred dominant partners that in general provided any female with more food, rather than partners that provided only her with more food, consistent with the idea that females may use male resource provisioning as a proximate mechanism to assess male condition. Together, these results indicate that male resources provisioning is (1) tightly linked to male social status, (2) a potential indicator of male condition and possibly genetic quality, and (3) a potential criterion for females to select dominant partners, thus playing an important role in the evolution of partner choice even in polygamous species lacking paternal care."

Macropods (such as kangaroos and wallabies) are iconic Australian native marsupials; however, some are considered important rangeland pests, and their presence in the urban and peri-urban environment often results in conflict. The management of these macropods is a contentious and volatile issue. We evaluated lion (Panthera leo), Sumatran tiger (P. tigris sumatrae), and dingo (Canis lupus dingo) fecal odors as short-term odor-based repellents for wild eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) and red-necked wallabies (M. rufogriseus). These odors were used to protect' highly palatable food sources; with any food not consumed (residue) collected and weighed each day. Trials were conducted at Long Grass Nature Reserve in Queensland, Australia from 9-29 January 2009. Both eastern grey kangaroos and red-necked wallabies relocated a minimum of 100m away from the food station treated with lion odors on the first day of the trial. As a result of this spatial shift, more food was consumed at the control food stations than at any food station treated with predator odors (regardless of predator). In particular, eastern grey kangaroos never fed from a single predator-odor food station. An increase in vigilance behaviors was observed for both macropod species, and red-necked wallabies were more likely to exhibit vigilance behaviors than feeding behaviors at predator odor food stations. There was no difference in food residue between any predator odors and these food stations were only visited on the first day of the study. Use of predator fecal odors may repel macropods from highly palatable food sources, and predator fecal odors also may be useful for macropod relocation. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society."

However, how does it work in species that do not produce such signals? We investigated how detection of a threat occurred in groups of kangaroos. We showed that detectors, through their vigilant posture, provided information about the threat to other close group members and reactions proceeded sequentially like a domino effect. Collective detection thus appears not to be restricted to social species that exhibit conspicuous alarm signals.Although collective detection plays a key role in determining individual survival, few studies have carefully examined the collective process of detection. We investigated collective detection in the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), a species that forages in temporary groups and rarely produces auditory alarm signals on detection. In experimental trials, we exposed one group member to a predation threat (a python, Morelia spilota) that its companions could only detect indirectly by observing the reaction of the detector. We videotaped these and control trials in which individuals were not exposed to the python and focal females simply used vigilance routinely. Our aims were to 1) examine whether collective detection occurred and, if so, 2) investigate the temporal pattern of the information transfer among individuals. The latencies between the focal females first scans and those of their 4 neighbors were shorter in the exposed than those in the control groups. The latencies between successive individuals scans were on average shorter in the exposed groups and at the beginning of the reaction chain, and interindividual distances acted to constrain information transfer. More individuals became vigilant in the exposed than in the control groups. Thus, detection of the snake by focal females provided information about a potential threat to other close group members and reactions to this initial detection proceeded sequentially like a domino effect. Collective detection thus is not restricted to social species that exhibit conspicuous alarm signals."

Human activities in general, and hunting in particular, often have significant impacts on the behaviour of wildlife through the anti-predator behaviours they evoke. Wild boar populations are rapidly expanding worldwide and their population densities are increasing.Aims. To examine hunting effects in combination with different land-use factors on the behaviour and social structure of wild boars (Sus scrofa) in Israel. Specifically, to examine differences in vigilant behaviour and social structure in agricultural areas (hunting permitted) and nature reserves (hunting prohibited).Methods. Motion-triggered cameras were installed to record wild boars' social structure and vigilance behaviour along movement trails. Age and sex of individual wild boars were identified, as were the size and structure of their social groups, and hunting in each of the studied areas was quantified.Key results. Results indicated significant differences in the vigilance behaviour of wild boars between agricultural areas and nature reserves. In agricultural areas, adult females were significantly more vigilant (P < 0.001) compared with adult males (P = 0.150). Additionally, in these areas there were significantly more adult males and fewer females leading family groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore, male yearlings were significantly more vigilant in agricultural areas (P < 0.001) compared with female yearlings (P = 0.164). Male yearlings tended to roam significantly more with family groups in agricultural areas compared with nature reserves, where they tended to roam alone or in groups (P = 0.029, P = 0.035).Conclusions. These results indicate social and behavioural differences in wild boars between agricultural areas and nature reserves, suggesting that hunting may have a substantial impact on their social structure and behaviour.Implications. Overall, the findings support the behavioural and social consequences of human hunting. Long-term implications of altered behavioural and social responses should be considered in management and conservations strategies. For instance, the high proportion of male yearlings in family groups in agricultural areas in autumn (October-December, mating season) may offer young males early access to reproductive females, even within the same social group. This may eventually lead to an increase in the reproductive potential of female wild boars."

This calls for an improvement of our knowledge on how large carnivores manage to coexist with humans, and on the effects that human activity has on large carnivore behaviour, especially in areas where carnivore populations are still endangered. Brown bears Ursus arctos have been shown to be sensitive to the presence of people and their activities. Thus, bear conservation and management should take into account potential behavioural alterations related to living in human-modified landscapes. We studied the behaviour of brown bears in the Cantabrian Mountains, NW Spain, where an endangered population thrives in a human-modified landscape. We analysed bear observations video-recorded over a 10-year period to try to identify human and landscape elements that could influence bear behaviour. Neither the occurrence nor the duration of vigilance behaviour in Cantabrian bears seemed to be influenced by the proximity of human infrastructures and activity. Our findings suggest that the general pattern of human avoidance by bears is adapted to the human-modified landscape they inhabit. Bears generally avoid people, but close presence of human infrastructures or activity did not seem to trigger an increased bear behavioural response. Coexistence between large carnivores and humans in human-modified landscapes is possible, even when human encroachment is high, provided that carnivores are not heavily persecuted and direct interactions are avoided. Further research should also document the potential existence of other responses to human presence and activity, e.g., hunting, traffic noise, and measuring stress levels with physiological indicators.

Although direct detection of a predator is assumed to be a better indicator of risk, only three previous studies have directly contrasted the relative information content of conspecific alarm calls to predator sounds. Studied species typically reacted equally or stronger to conspecific alarm calls than to predator sounds, suggesting that an indirect cue may be a more reliable indicator of risk. We studied zenaida doves', Zenaida aurita, responsiveness to predator sounds and conspecific alarm signals. When flushed, zenaida doves produced voluntary mechanical wing whistles, which we predicted to be alarm signals. Observing responses to wing flap playbacks with and without whistles, we found that doves increased vigilance significantly more to wing whistles than to wing flaps without whistles or control playbacks. These results indicate that conspecifics interpret wing whistles as alarm signals. We then conducted another playback experiment, which demonstrated that red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis, playbacks elicited higher levels of dove vigilance than conspecific wing whistles. Contrary to other species, zenaida doves seemingly consider predator vocalizations more informative than conspecific alarm signals. Therefore, the reliability of acoustic signals associated with predation risk may strongly influence prey responsiveness to direct and indirect cues.

Although deep learning proved its effectiveness to classify optical multispectral data, this peculiar classification task shows many challenges: (1) the considered TSs are noisy due to the presence of clouds that corrupts the multitemporal spectral signature, thus affecting the classification results, (2) TSs of different tiles are made up of images acquired in different dates (different temporal sampling), and (3) a large training database of labeled samples is needed to train the deep model from scratch. To address these problems, this paper presents an approach based on three main steps: (1) a preprocessing step that aims to generate temporally homogeneous TSs of images across tiles that accurately represent the phenological behavior of the crops, (2) a training set extraction step that automatically establishes a large training database leveraging publicly available thematic products, and (3) a multitemporal deep learning classification where a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for crop type mapping. Experimental results show that the proposed system architecture is promising for solving large-scale problems.

We aimed to investigate whether this close proximity to zoo visitors impacted upon four species of macropod (red kangaroo Macropus rufus, red-necked wallaby Macropus rufogriseus, swamp wallaby Wallabia bicolor, and quokka Setonix brachyurus) in a free-range exhibit in an Australian zoo. Specifically, we used instantaneous scan sampling to assess animal behavior and examined whether visitor number affected the proportion of individuals that exhibited four target behaviors; visitor-directed vigilance, retreat, resting, and foraging behavior. We found that the proportion of individuals exhibiting visitor-directed vigilance significantly increased as pedestrian visitor number increased for three of the four species, and the proportion of individuals that were resting was significantly negatively related to visitor number for both wallaby species. The proportion of individuals of each species foraging or retreating was unrelated to visitor number. These data suggest that a visitor effect exists in a walk-through exhibit of macropods, and once visitor numbers go beyond a threshold, the behavior of more animals is impacted, likely compromising welfare. Interestingly, quokka do not appear to be affected by zoo visitors; which may be due to visitor pressure being perceived differently due to evolutionary differences, or that housing and husbandry ameliorate the visitor effect for this species but not others. Like many studies before, taking a species-specific approach to understanding zoo visitor-animal interactions has determined how the visitor effect likely impacts macropods differently."

We found the general trend for flicking being a reflection of vigilance and predation risk. Flicking was related to flock size as rates decreased with increasing flock size, which might be related to a decreased individual predation risk in larger flocks. Moreover, we found flicking to be related to body condition and prey flushing. However, effect sizes for these hypotheses were only available from very few studies (body condition k=2, prey flushing k=3). Hence, future research concerning these two functions are necessary. Finally, our results suggested that flicking is not used for social communication, as it was not related to the presence of a conspecific or social status of an individual."

A number of studies have demonstrated that red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have a profound effect on the population biology of some species. However, not all species exposed to fox predation have declined. We studied the antipredator behaviour of a species that has not declined - the red-necked pademelon (Thylogale thetis), and contrasted it with previous studies on a species that has declined - the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), to try to understand behavioural factors associated with survival. We focused on two antipredator behaviours: predator recognition and the way in which antipredator vigilance is influenced by the presence of conspecifics. We found that predator-naive pademelons responded to the sight of certain predators, suggesting that they had some degree of innate recognition ability. However, pademelons responded similarly to a broad range of acoustic stimuli, including dingo howls, wedge-tailed eagle calls, foot-thumps - a predator-elicited sound - and a control sound, suggesting that they did not specifically recognize predator vocalizations. Unlike a number of other macropodid marsupials, including tammars, pademelons did not modify time allocated to antipredator vigilance as group size increased. Taken together, these results suggest that red-necked pademelons independently assessed and managed their predation risk whereas tammars relied more on conspecifics to assess and manage risk. We suggest that these factors may have been important determinants of species survival. More generally, we suggest that a fundamental understanding of antipredator behaviour can enlighten conservation efforts."

We studied the degree to which competition for food influenced the time tammar wallabies (Macropus eugeni) allocate to foraging and vigilance by experimentally manipulating access to food, while holding other factors constant. Groups of six wallabies were observed when they had access to either one or six non-depleting bins of supplemental food. Food availability had no effect on the time allocated to foraging, looking or affiliative interactions, and this was true whether individuals or groups were treated as the unit of analysis. However, wallabies engaged in substantially more aggressive acts in the high-competition treatment. These results, when combined with other findings, suggest that the moderately social tammar wallaby receives an antipredator benefit by aggregating with conspecifics which is not reduced significantly by foraging competition."

The majority of studies reporting moon-light effects have been conducted on small-body sized mammals which are relatively vulnerable to a variety of predators. Moonlight effects were studied experimentally on a mid-sized mammal, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), a macropodid marsupial. Four groups of six adult female wallabies were observed for 6 days during each of three moon phases (no moon, quarter moon and full moon). In addition to natural illumination, wallabies were exposed to 2 days each of three artificial light treatments (no light, red light, white light) during each moon phase treatment. Subjects were videotaped at night with an image intensifier affixed to a video camera. Time budgets were calculated from the video record, and later analyzed in a repeated-measures factorial ANOVA. There was no effect of natural moonlight on time allocation, suggesting that wallabies had no endogenous cycle associated with moonlight. There were effects of artificial illumination and of the experimental group on time allocation. Wallabies tended to forage more and allocate less, time to antipredator vigilance under the two light treatments suggesting that, unlike previous studies on a variety of other taxa, they associated safety with increased illumination. We speculate that differences among groups might reflect the different seasons over which Wallabies were studied; Results suggest that the nocturnally active tammar wallaby exercises caution in the dark."

Predation may be an important selective pressure, acting mainly on females. In this study, I tested the latter hypothesis on the coal-crested finch (Charitospiza eucosma Oberholser, 1905) in a neotropical savanna of the Central Brazil (Cerrado). I used capture methods for ascertaining the sex ratio in the population, and focal observations to gather behavioral data. My results show that the sex ratio is skewed toward males (1:1.39). Males were more vigilant, vocalized for longer periods of time, and used higher perches than females. Females foraged more, spent more time on parental care and remained on the ground for longer periods than males. These results support the 'foraging effort hypothesis, suggesting that females are more preyed upon because they spend more time foraging. Ultimately, this may reflect the fact that females invest more on parental care than males. The sex-dependent parental investment may favor the evolution of different antipredator strategies in males and females: the camouflage in females as a less efficient strategy than vigilance in males."

We recorded seasonal variation in individual and social behaviour of a natural population of degus (Octodon degus), a diurnal, semi-subterranean and social rodent from central Chile. We related changes in degu activity to differences in sex, seasonality (breeding activity, abundance of high quality food), and abundance of degu predators. On average, degus allocated most of their time while active above ground to foraging (46%) and alertness (32%); activities such as resting (8%), locomotor activity (7%), self-grooming (3%), burrow digging (0.2%), dust-bathing (1%), and social interactions (3%) occupied a relatively small percentage of degus' time budget. Time spent in foraging and total vigilance did not vary seasonally, but they were inversely related, reflecting a trade-off. Degus adjusted bipedal vigilance and locomotor activity partially to the presence of predators. Sex interacted with seasonality to influence degu behaviour. Male degus dust-bathed more and were more aggressive toward conspecifics than females during breeding time. We hypothesize that breeding activity is a more important predictor than abundance of high quality food to account for these interactions."

Because sleeping reduces the ability of an individual to detect potential threats, not all individuals should sleep at the same time. The obvious solution of taking turns to sleep is not documented in animal groups. Individuals can also organize their sleeping bouts independently of each other but this simple strategy can be dangerous if too many individuals happen to sleep at the same time. One solution to this problem is to monitor the behaviour of other group members and adjust sleeping bouts accordingly. For instance, as the number of sleeping individuals increases, companions may decide that it must be a safe time to sleep. However, when fewer group members are sleeping, an individual may benefit by curtailing sleep, given that it would be more vulnerable than vigilant group members should an attack occur. Such monitoring can therefore lead to contagious behaviour in the group, which can be detected in a group by collective waves of activities through time. Using spectral analysis, I investigated the proportion of sleeping birds in loafing gulls (Larus spp.) as a function of time over 2 yr and found that in many groups, the proportion of sleeping birds rises and decreases in a systematic and statistically significant fashion. These results add more weight to the now increasingly supported view that vigilance in general is a social phenomenon and suggest that adaptive behaviour at the level of the individual can lead to collective phenomena such as waves of sleep in animal groups."

The goal of this study was to describe and compare the visual fields of two ground-foraging passerines, House Finch Carpodacus mexicanus and House Sparrow Passer domesticus. We found that both species have a binocular field type that is associated with the accurate control of bill position when pecking. Both species have eye movements of relatively large amplitude, which can produce substantial variations in the configuration of the binocular fields. We propose that in these ground foragers, their relatively wide binocular fields could function to increase foraging efficiency by locating multiple rather than single food items prior to pecking events. The lateral fields of both species are wide enough to facilitate the detection of predators or conspecifics while head-down foraging. This suggests that foraging and scanning are not mutually exclusive activities in these species, as previously assumed. Furthermore, we found some slight, but significant, differences between species: House Sparrow binocular fields are both wider and vertically taller, and the blind area is wider than in House Finches. These differences may be related to variations in the degree of eye movements and position of the orbits in the skull."

The two continuous feeding strategies did not differ among individuals in vigilance rate, nor in vigilance time or mean scan duration. However, with respect to flocking behaviour, visual foragers differed from tactile foragers in foraging flock size. The relationships between flocking behaviour and foraging strategy are discussed.

Quantifying the impact that these organisms have on their prey can be challenging, as direct observation and measurement of arthropod predation is difficult. The use of sentinel prey is one method to measure predator impact; however, despite widespread use, few studies have compared predation on different prey types within a single experiment. This study evaluated the predation rates on four sentinel prey items in grass and wheat fields in south-east Queensland, Australia. Attack rates on live and dead Helicoverpa armigera eggs, and dead H. armigera larvae and artificial plasticine larvae, were compared and the predators that were attracted to each prey type were documented with the use of field cameras. There was no significant difference in predation rates between sentinel eggs, while dead larvae were significantly more attacked than artificial larvae. Prey were attacked by a diverse range of predators, including ants, beetles, various nymph and juvenile insects and small mammals. Different predators were active in grass and crop fields, with predator activity peaking around dawn and dusk. The same trends were observed within and between the two habitats studied, providing a measure of confidence in the sentinel prey method. A range of different sentinel prey types could be suitable for use in most comparative studies; however, each prey type has its own benefits and limitations, and these should be carefully evaluated to determine which is most suitable to address the research questions."

However, the response of group- foraging individuals to cryptic prey remains poorly studied. We investigated the effect of the presence of an experienced or a naive conspeci. c on the ability of nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata, to exploit millet seeds presented on cryptic and noncryptic backgrounds. The conspeci. c's level of experience did not affect a focal bird's foraging, so we lumped both experience condition for analysis. The presence of a competitor tended to increase the occurrences of vigilance and food searching, but it did not affect the duration of vigilance. In contrast, foraging on a cryptic background significantly affected foraging by reducing the occurrences of food searching and vigilance, and increasing the latency to eat the first seed as well as the number of detection errors. Background type and competitor presence interacted significantly for searching bout duration, number of seeds eaten and foraging efficiency. In all cases, competitor presence negatively affected foraging efficiency under cryptic backgrounds. Finally, the foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a competitor on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers."

Activities of parents with different numbers of offspring also were compared. The dominant activities of geese were alert, resting and feeding behaviors, which together averaged greater than or equal to 70% of the diurnal period regardless of social class, habitat, year, season or location. For both males and females, parents spent more time alert than pairs during fall, winter and spring. Parental vigilance probably benefitted young by allowing them greater access to food. Generally, the costs of maintaining this parental vigilance were apparently spread across several activities so that time spent resting or feeding did not differ between parents and pairs. The only exception was for females at Union County Conservation Area (CA) in fall, when the behavioral cost of parental vigilance was less time feeding. Parent males with greater than or equal to 3 offspring rested less than those with only one offspring. In lake habitats, females with two offspring fed more than females with three offspring. It is suggested that for Interior Canada Geese, diurnal time constraints on parents during fall-spring have only minor influences on the evolution of optimal brood size when compared to constraints during the nesting season."

We report marked differences in the visual fields of two auk species. In air, Common Guillemots Uria aalge have relatively narrow binocular fields typical of those found in non-passerine predatory birds. Atlantic Puffins Fratercula arctica have much broader binocular fields similar to those that have hitherto been recorded in passerines and in a penguin. In water, visual fields narrow considerably and binocularity in the direction of the bill is probably abolished in both auk species. Although perceptual challenges associated with foraging are similar in both species during the breeding season, when they are piscivorous, Puffins (but not Guillemots) face more exacting perceptual challenges when foraging at other times, when they take a high proportion of small invertebrate prey. Capturing this prey probably requires more accurate, visually guided bill placement and we argue that this is met by the Puffin's broader binocular field, which is retained upon immersion; its upward orientation may enable prey to be seen in silhouette. These visual field configurations have potentially important consequences that render these birds vulnerable to collision with human artefacts underwater, but not in air. They also have consequences for vigilance behaviour."

We measured time the head was up (head up), step lengths (m/min), and tortuosity of foraging paths in 547 focal observations in a nomnigratory population of Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) in Redwood National and State Parks, California, United States. Focal observations were 4-15 min in length. Head up was positively related to proximity (within 1 body length of other elk) for females and males but the slope was steeper for males. When males were aggregated with females, head up was more elevated than when males were aggregated with other males. Sex-specific social behaviors did not influence step length and foraging path tortuosity. Social behavior disrupted efficient foraging. Connecting social behavior to foraging behavior can help explain the numerous ways that size-dimorphic females and males display ecological differences."

The results showed that when Tb is decreasing near the beginning of the dark phase, the percentage of total recording time (%TRT) spent in SWS and PS was elevated in fasting due to increased frequency of episodes and increased duration of PS episodes. When Tb was low during the middle segment of the dark phase, SWS was elevated in fasting due to increased episode duration. However, fasting did not alter PS, which increased in %TRT across the segment due to increased episode frequency.

Although predator-prey interactions increasingly occur in habitats that experience multiple forms of human-generated disturbance, it is unclear how different forms of disturbance might affect antipredator behavior. Fire is a contemporary disturbance that has dramatic effects on terrestrial habitats. Such habitats may have also experienced past disturbances, like agricultural land use, that leave lasting legacies on habitat structure (e.g., overstory and understory composition). It is unclear how these past and present disturbances affect the use of different antipredator behaviors, like temporal avoidance and vigilance. We examined whether variation in disturbance regimes generates differences in ungulate antipredator behavior by using cameras to measure white-tailed deer vigilance and activity time across 24 longleaf pine woodlands that vary in past land use and contemporary fire regime. Regardless of land-use history, woodlands with high fire frequencies had 4 times less vegetation cover than low-fire woodlands, generating riskier habitats for deer; however, deer responded to fire with different antipredator strategies depending on land-use history. In nonagricultural woodlands, fire affected deer activity time such that activity was nocturnal in low-fire woodlands and crepuscular in high-fire woodlands. In post-agricultural woodlands, fire affected vigilance and not activity time such that deer were more vigilant in high-fire woodlands than in low-fire woodlands. These results suggest that ungulate antipredator behavior may vary spatially depending on past land use and contemporary fire regime, and such disturbances may generate landscapes of fear that persist for decades after agricultural use."

Pikas increased their vigilance after playback of alarm calls of heterospecific mammals (marmots and ground squirrels), but responded most strongly to conspecific calls. While responses to playback calls of their own, of neighbours and of a stranger did not differ, pikas did discriminate between individual callers in a habituation-discrimination experiment. The ability to make use of information from different sources in their acoustic environment likely facilitates pikas' behavioural decisions that affect foraging, predator avoidance and nepotism."

Five studies examined this issue, focusing on self-control tasks requiring avoidance or vigilance. Studies 1 to 3 indicated that these tasks resulted in greater relative right hemispheric activation. Studies 4 and 5 indicated that, consistent with this pattern of differential activation, initial vigilance self-control resulted in better subsequent performance on a spatial self-regulatory task but worse performance on a verbal self-regulatory task. These findings provide additional insight into the dynamics of self-regulatory behavior across tasks, suggesting the combination of tasks examined may influence the pattern of results obtained."

Results showed that frequencies of foraging and moving were the main behaviors of the plateau pikas. In yak foraging areas, pikas foraged more frequently than they were vigilant in winter with reversed pattern in summer; and this occurred in both pastoral and bedding areas for domestic herbivores.

Previous research has found that some animal species can discriminate among conspecifics, and recent findings indicate that some species are also able to discriminate among heterospecifics, including humans. The ability to discriminate between humans based on voice recognition has been thoroughly investigated in domestic species and in some wild species housed in captivity. However, human voice recognition remains largely untested in wild animals living in their natural environment. In the present study, we investigated whether wild Western Australian magpies can discriminate between the voices of familiar and unfamiliar humans using playback experiments. Magpies showed an increase in vigilance when exposed to playback of unfamiliar voices compared with familiar, suggesting that magpies perceive unfamiliar humans as a greater threat. These results provide the first evidence that birds in their natural environment have the capacity to discriminate between humans using vocal recognition. Given that humans can represent a threat for wild animals, this capacity to discriminate based on vocal familiarity may be beneficial."

We exposed free-living adult RGS to playbacks of alarm calls differing in rate and length to determine whether adult receivers respond to the same alarm parameters as juveniles. Adult squirrels did not respond differentially to differences in call rate or length, suggesting that adult RGS do not attend to call rate as do juveniles. This difference in response may be attributable to a developmental change in the perceptual mechanisms by which individuals extract information regarding response urgency, but could also be a product of adult receivers devaluing information encoded in alarm calls emitted by relatively inexperienced juvenile signalers."

The durations of 12 behaviors were compared between 14 females who were barren in the following year (BN) and 28 females who fawned in the next year (FN). The results showed that barren females were more active and affinitive during the non-mating season of the previous year than females who fawned, who were more alert and expressed male-specific tail-pasting behavior during the mating season."

Despite the potential benefits for the development of social, cognitive and motor skills, play behavior has costs: energy expenditure, and the risks of injury and predation. As the fitness benefits of play are presumably to be gained as adults, we expect young animals to minimize its immediate costs. Here, we describe play behavior in golden lion tamarins (GLTs) (Leontopithecus rosalia ) and test cost-minimizing hypotheses. We collected data on play behavior and adult vigilance in nine groups (four wild and five supplemented, the latter deriving from a reintroduction) of wild-living lion tamarins (16 infants) in Brazil. Results showed that play occupied 3.8% of the activity budget, occurred during the hottest times of the day, and was characterized by being mainly social, involving partners of different ages, and sometimes different species. We found no differences in playing time between wild and supplemented groups. The lion tamarins played less in 'dangerous' substrates (canopy branches and forest floor), and more in 'safe' substrates (large branches and vine tangles), and favored playing in the center of the group over the periphery. The reproductive animals were vigilant during 78% of the time the infants were playing, and were mostly oriented away from the playing animals. The observed organization of play behavior suggests that juvenile GLTs minimize the risk of predation and accidental injuries, but do not seem to minimize energy expenditure and the risks of social injuries. The social-cognitive benefits acquired from experience of older partners during play may overcome the costs of the latter behavior, and because little time was spent in play, the energetic costs may be inconsequential."
"GERSTNER, GE; FAZIO, VA",EVIDENCE OF A UNIVERSAL PERCEPTUAL UNIT IN MAMMALS,ETHOLOGY,101,89,100,,1995,"Evidence from many studies conducted over the past century suggests that human perception is partitioned into 1-4-s units. More recently, a similar 1-4-s time constant has been found in non-perceptual phenomena, i.e. movement patterns, of both human and non-human mammalian species. Based on these findings, it appears that an evolutionarily conserved mechanism exists that segments human and non-human mammalian motor actions into 1-4-s units. This being the case, it is believed that the 1-4-s segmentation seen in human perception may also occur in mammalian perception. However, it is currently impossible to determine whether both human and non-human perception is partitioned into 1-4-s units because the paradigms used to study the 1-4-s unit in human perception cannot be applied to non-human species. This study hypothesized that vigilance postures represent a paradigm that will allow such comparative work. This is based on the fact that investigators recently found that vigilant postures in humans are partitioned into 1-4-s units, and the literature argues strongly that vigilance is largely a perceptual phenomenon. With this in mind, the current study determined whether similar vigilant postures occur in non-human mammals and whether such vigilant postures are also segmented into 1-4-s units. The study found that such postures averaged 2-3.5 s in primates (n = 1 species), carnivores (n = 2 species), artiodactyls (n = 3 species), and marsupials (n = 1 species). These findings support the hypothesis that perception in humans and other mammals is partitioned into units by a conserved mechanism. It is believed that vigilant postures will be an important quantifiable bioassay with which to conduct comparative studies of mammalian perception."

We hypothesized that this decrease in activity is a predator-avoidance response to wind conditions that decrease the effectiveness of the alarm calls of pikas. We examined this hypothesis by broadcasting and rerecording the prominent frequencies (900-5,500 Hz) of pikas' calls and by observing behavior of focal pikas during varying weather conditions. Both attenuation of pure tones and the amount of wind noise increased significantly as wind speed increased. Additionally, wind direction created asymmetrical patterns of attenuation of pure tones, potentially distorting and degrading the call. Further, pikas spent significantly more time inactive at higher wind speeds, with nonvigilant active behaviors decreasing at a higher rate than vigilant active behaviors. Examination of these data supports the hypothesis and suggests that wind influences the behavior of animals that rely on alarm calls."
GLUECK E,AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF FEEDING VIGILANCE AND PREDATOR AVOIDANCE IN A SINGLE BIRD,Oecologia (Berlin),71,268,272,,1987,"In an aviary experiment with captive Goldfinches (Carduelis carduelis L.) vigilance and foraging behaviour were recorded before and after the appearance of a predator. When foraging, individual Goldfinches had a low head jerk rate during the first minute, but each scan was of relatively expanded duration; the scanning rate increased with a shorter duration of each scan up to the time the predator, a Merlin (Falco columbarius), appeared. Thereafter the birds showed a low head jerk rate, which returned to the former level after ten minutes. The time spent feeding was low if head jerk rate was low and high if head jerk rate was high. There were significantly more scans of long duration after the predator was visible compared with undisturbed feeding. The intake loss of individuals due to increased vigilance after the appearance of the predator during the following minutes is calculated to be 53%. A linear, negative regression function is formulated relating the number of scans per time unit and total time spent scanning: SCAN DURATION = -0.99 .times. HEAD JERKS + 62.46 (r = -0.96, P < 0.001) With increased number of scans the total time spent vigilant is decreased. From this is concluded that if birds ingest relatively large sized seeds and therefore only a few per time unit they gain a higher security against predators compared to feeding on small sized seeds and ingesting relatively more, because time not spent vigilant is increased with increased pecking rate."

The behaviour of both parents and offspring appear to be influenced by declining food availability over the winter. Parental vigilance increased with brood size and may be explained by vigilance having functions in addition to antipredator behaviour where the benefits are shared among the brood. There was no increase in parental aggression with brood size and this does not fit the prediction of shared care. Nevertheless, large families are able to monopolize better feeding areas compared with smaller families and large families static feed more but walk feed less than do small families, the former apparently being the preferred mode. The presence of additional young, rather than increasing the amount of parental aggression, seems to enhance the family's competitive ability. Because parents with large broods benefit from enhanced access to resources there is likely to be no additional significant cost in the parental care of larger broods (sensu Trivers 1972)."

Behaviour Therapy, 28, 271-284)] implicating attention to pain as an important factor in the development of chronic pain highlight the need for a self-report measure that assesses the tendency to attend to pain. The Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire (PVAQ: McCracken, 1997) is a potentially useful measure of pain-related attention. However. its present wording precludes its use with non-clinical samples and its psychometric properties have not been examined in samples other than chronic low back pain. In the present study, the Factor structure and psychometric properties of the PVAQ modified for use with a non-chronic pain sample were evaluated. A series of principal-components analyses supported a hierarchical solution comprised of three lower-order factors (viz. Awareness of Change, Intrusion, and Monitoring) and a single higher-order pain vigilance and attention Factor. Cronbach`s alphas indicated that the PVAQ total scale and the three subscales identified in the principal-components analysis had excellent to adequate internal consistency. Supportive of the validity of the PVAQ, significant positive associations between PVAQ scores and important pain variables (viz.. pain severity ratings and change/restriction in lifestyle) were found. Potential applications of the modified PVAQ as well as directions for further psychometric evaluation are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

However, to fully understand the benefits of group-living, it is important to quantify the costs of living alone. Here, we look at the fate of floaters (individuals who have no fixed territory and remain alone for extended periods) in a population of cooperatively breeding pied babblers Turdoides bicolor. We found that individuals spent less time foraging and more time vigilant for predators when found as a floater compared to when they were in a group. Consequently, they suffered a continuous loss of body mass, with long-term floaters suffering the highest losses. This had a long-term effect: floaters that eventually did regain a position in a group usually entered as helpers, in contrast to dispersers, who usually entered a new group as breeders. This high cost of living alone highlights the benefits of group-living and may help to understand patterns of delayed dispersal in some social species."

However, they have at least two potentially damaging ecological effects. Their rotating blades are hazardous to raptors which occasionally fly into them. And wind turbines are very noisy when active, a feature that may interfere with the lives of animals beneath them. We studied California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area of Northern California. These squirrels emit vocalizations that alert others to the presence of a predator, and so may be forced to compensate for turbine noise by modifying antipredator behavior. We compared the antipredator behavior of squirrels at two sites, one close to and the other far from turbines, and under two conditions, during baseline and playback of conspecific alarm calls. We generated composite two variables using principle components analysis, one representing vigilance and one representing another cautionary antipredator tactic, for further statistical comparisons. Animals at the Turbine site exhibited elevated levels of vigilance and showed increased caution demonstrated in part, by returning to the area near their burrows during alarm calling. We conclude that this site difference is probably caused by the disparity in turbine noise, since predator abundance, group size, and vegetation type and density were similar for the two sites. Though population level impacts of these behavioral differences remain to be explored, our results indicate that behavioral impacts of turbines on wildlife should be considered during future turbine development.

This playback study focused on the antipredator behavior differences between melanistic and gray morphs of eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in Hiram, Ohio. Vigilance, tail flagging, freezing, and escape behaviors were recorded in response to digital playback of an American robin call, a chickadee call, a car alarm, a buzzer, or one of two different red-tailed hawk calls. All squirrels exhibited increased antipredator behavior after hearing increasingly threatening stimuli. Consistent with prior findings in other species with color polymorphism, gray morphs were more likely to escape after hearing a threatening call. A growing body of evidence indicates it is possible to study pleiotropic effects of genes in free living animals."

For example, by comparing the interaction between tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and dugongs (Dugong dugon) to that between gray wolves (Canis lupus) and elk (Cervus elaphus), we show that top predators in marine and terrestrial ecosystems trigger three similar types of anti-predator behavior: (1) encounter avoidance, (2) escape facilitation, and (3) increased vigilance. By implication, the ecological roles of top predators in both ecosystems may be more similar than previously thought, and studies that fail to account for multiple modes of anti-predator behavior are likely to underestimate these roles and the consequences of eliminating predators from ecosystems. We encourage more communication between marine and terrestrial ecologists, in the interest of generating further insights into ecosystem dynamics and conservation."
"Earnst, SL",Parental care in Tundra Swans during the pre-fledging period,WATERBIRDS,25,268,277,,2002,"Among studies that have quantified the care of precocial young, few have investigated forms of parental care other than vigilance. During the pre-fledging period, Tundra Swan (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) parents provided simultaneous biparental care by foraging near each other and their cygnets, and cygnets spent more time foraging during bouts in which both parents were foraging nearby than when only one parent was foraging nearby. Parents spent nearly twice as much foraging time on land than did non-parents, a habitat in which cygnets foraged more intensely than parents (i.e., spent more time foraging during foraging bouts) and could graze on protein-rich sedges rather than use more difficult below-water foraging methods. Parents also spent more than twice as much time being vigilant and more than three times as much time defending their territory than non-parents, behaviors that presumably benefited cygnets by decreasing predation risk and indirect foraging competition, respectively. Parents therefore incurred the costs of foraging less intensely during foraging bouts, spending more time interacting, more time in vigilance, and less time sleeping/preening than non-parents."

Observations were made of 33 Przewalski horses (Equus ferus przewalskii) (male N=20, female N=13) living under natural social conditions on a large reserve in France. Significant left-eye/side biases were found in agonistic interactions within harem bands (M +/- SE bias to left 58%+/- 0.01 for threats, P<0.001; 68%+/- 0.05 for attacks; P<0.001)and in stallion fights (threats, 52%+/- 0.01 left, P<0.001; attacks, 63%+/- 0.02 left, P<0.001): as many as 80% of the horses were significantly lateralized in attack responses within harem bands. Laterality of vigilance was measured as lifting up the head from grazing and turning it to the left or right side: a directional bias to the left was found (M +/- SE 53% +/- 0.02 left, P<0.001). Side bias in reactivity was calculated as the percent of head lifts above the level of the withers on the left or right side and this was also left side biased (M +/- SE 73% +/- 0.03 left, P<0.001). These results indicate right-hemisphere specialization for control of aggression and responses to novelty. The left bias in attack scores within harem bands was stronger in males than females (P=0.024) and in immature than adult horses (P=0.032). Immature horses were also more strongly lateralized than adults in vigilance scores (P=0.022), which may suggest that experience reduces these side biases. Our results show that Przewalski horses exhibit left eye preferences, as do feral horses, and do so even more strongly than feral horses. Considering feral and Przewalski horses together, we deduce that ancestral horses had similar lateral biases. Also similar to feral horses, the Przewalski horses showed no significant forelimb preference at the group level or in the majority of horses at the individual level, confirming the hypothesis that previously reported limb preferences in domestic breeds are entrained or generated by breed-specific selection.

We used wild-caught chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) to investigate (a) the effect of settling in period duration on the likelihood that chaffinches foraged during experimental trials and (b) whether settling in period duration influenced measures of foraging and vigilance behaviour recorded from those experiments. The probability of collecting foraging data from an individual's first trial fell below 50% if it had been in captivity for more than 12 days prior to that trial, whereas the probability was > 75% if trials were completed within two days of capture. The successful collection of foraging data from subsequent trials was also dependent on the number of days an individual spent in captivity prior to its first trial and on whether that individual foraged in its first trial, suggesting that some individuals were more inclined to forage in captivity. Individuals that foraged in their first trial had a 94% higher success rate in subsequent trials than those that did not. However, settling in period duration did not significantly influence the peck rate, mean search period or mean vigilance period of individuals that did forage. Our results show that allowing a settling in period actually reduced the likelihood of collecting foraging data from chaffinches and that commencing experiments shortly after capture increased data collection efficiency. We discuss the possibility that the inability to collect data from certain birds following a settling in period could lead to potentially important biases in results. particularly if propensity to forage is linked to an individual's coping strategy or personality. We conclude that it may not always be beneficial to allow wild-caught animals to habituate to captivity before commencing experiments. In some cases, testing animals soon after capture may increase the likelihood of data collection, reducing both the number of study animals required and the length of time they spend in captivity."

We investigated an aerial alarm call of the American robin and specifically examined how call rate (reflecting intensity) and age affect the anti-predator behaviors of responders. Both juveniles and adults significantly altered their behavior upon hearing playbacks of seet calls; they foraged less and increased vigilance and other anti-predator behaviors. Adult robins were also able to distinguish between low intensity and high intensity calls; skygazing, an important behaviour that allows robins to scan for raptors, increased with call rate. Juveniles, on the other hand, skygazed less and there was a trend for juveniles to spend more time alert than adults suggesting that some learning may be involved."

Predation is by nature highly variable in time; however, this aspect of predation risk has traditionally been overlooked by behavioural ecologists. Lima and Bednekoff proposed the predation risk allocation hypothesis (RAH), predicting how temporal variation in predation risk drives prey antipredator behaviours. This model is based on the concept that prey adaptively allocate their foraging and antipredator efforts across high- and low-risk situations, depending on the duration of high- vs. low-risk situations and the relative risk associated with each of them. An unstudied extension of the RAH is the effect of predictability of predation risk. A predictable risk should lead to prey displaying minimal vigilance behaviours during predictable low-risk periods and the strongest antipredator behaviours during risky periods. Conversely, an unpredictable predation risk should result in prey displaying constant vigilance behaviour, with suboptimal foraging rates during periods of safety but antipredator behaviours of lower intensity during periods of risk. We tested this extension of the RAH using convict cichlids exposed to high-risk alarm cues at two frequencies of risk (1x vs. 3x) per day, on either a fixed or random schedule for 5 d. We then tested the fish for a response to high-risk cues (alarm cues) and to low-risk cues (disturbance resulting from the introduction of distilled water). Our study supports previous results on the effects of risk frequency and cue intensity on cichlid behaviour. We failed to show an effect of risk predictability on the behavioural responses of cichlids to high-risk alarm cues, but predictability did influence responses to low-risk cues. We encourage further studies to test the effect of predictability in other systems."

Perceived predation risk constitutes a major factor that should shape adaptive phenotypic plasticity in sleep but it is unclear to what degree an individual can tailor sleep to different types of risk. If animals base behavioural decisions on the predation landscape then we would expect individuals to adjust their sleep behaviour when exposed to changes in predation risk. Here we investigated the plasticity of phenotypic sleep in wild great tits roosting in nestboxes and exposed to different types of predation risk. Following our prediction, when exposed to experimentally increased perceived predation risk from owls, Strix aluco (a bird that can prey on birds solely outside their roosting cavity), individuals increased total sleep duration. Contrary to our prediction, when exposed to experimentally increased perceived predation risk from martens, Martes martes (a mammal that can prey on birds inside cavities), individuals woke up less often during the night, but otherwise did not change their sleep behaviour. Birds did not alter total time spent awake during the night in response to predator exposure. Our findings demonstrate that individual great tits modify their sleep behaviour in response to changes in predation risk. Ecological factors including exposure to predators, resource availability and reproductive competition may act as significant constraints on natural sleep patterns and warrant further investigation with free- living individuals.

Fire intensity as defined by Byram (1959) is the most commonly used term describing fire behavior in the wildfire community. It is, however, difficult to observe from space. Here, we assess fire spread and fire radiative power using infrared sensors with different spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. The sensors used offer either high spatial resolution (Sentinel-2) for fire detection, but a low temporal resolution, moderate spatial resolution and daily observations (VIIRS), and high temporal resolution with low spatial resolution and fire radiative power retrievals (Meteosat SEVIRI). We extracted fire fronts from Sentinel-2 (using the shortwave infrared bands) and use the available fire products for S-NPP VIIRS and Meteosat SEVIRI. Rate of spread was analyzed by measuring the displacement of fire fronts between the mid-morning Sentinel-2 overpasses and the early afternoon VIIRS overpasses. We retrieved FRP from 15-min Meteosat SEVIRI observations and estimated total fire radiative energy release over the observed fire fronts. This was then converted to total fuel consumption, and, by making use of Sentinel-2-derived burned area, to fuel consumption per unit area. Using rate of spread and fuel consumption per unit area, Byram's fire intensity could be derived. We tested this approach on a small number of fires in a frequently burning West African savanna landscape. Comparison to field experiments in the area showed similar numbers between field observations and remote-sensing-derived estimates.

The results showed that adult and juvenile tundra swan had roughly the same behavioral rhythm, and no significant difference was found in other behaviours. Adult tundra swan took on more vigilance tasks. The wintering swan spent most of their time to foraging (45. 47%). Foraging rate showed two peaks, one began from 9:00 am, foraging rate up to 79. 48%, another appeared in late afternoon 17:00. During the morning, swans showed a higher rate of flying behaviour, but in the other time of this day, it showed lower rate. Diurnal activity rhythm of wintering tundra swans, vigilance, resting, cruise and preening behavior kept a low percentage as 10%, while the percentage of standing and wing-spreading behavior fluctuated at a very low level. There was no conflicting behaviour in this research."

Studies of suites of behaviours across well-defined contrasts of predation risk and type are rare, however. Here we explored the degree to which six herbivore species adjusted their antipredator behaviours to two predator treatments (lion, Panthera leo, versus cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, and wild dogs, Lycaon pictus). We focused on prey behaviour (vigilance, grouping, temporal use) at waterholes. We predicted that if the hunting strategy of the predator was the key driver of antipredator behaviour, ambushing lions would elicit a greater response than cursorial cheetah and wild dogs. Alternatively, if predator preference was the main driver, then we expected prey species to adjust their antipredator behaviours in response to the predators that specifically target them (i.e. preferred prey of the different predators). Overall, we found that the herbivores maintained greater vigilance, generally moved in larger groups and used waterholes less at dawn, at dusk or at night (when lions are active) when exposed to the potential threat of ambushing lions. However, some species within the accessible prey range of cheetah and/or wild dogs (i.e. red hartebeest, warthog, gemsbok) moved in larger groups when exposed to these predators. Yet, the magnitude of the differences in group size for these herbivores were small. Thus, we suggest that, overall, the potential threat of ambushing lions was the main driver of antipredator behaviour around waterholes, probably determined by prey weight preference and the possibility of being ambushed.

The landslide occurred in the early morning of 24 June 2017 and killed more than 100 people in the village of Xinmo. Sentinel-1 images have been processed through an advanced multi-interferogram analysis capable of maximising the density of measurement points, generating ground deformation maps and displacement time series for an area of 460 km(2) straddling the Minjiang River and the Songping Gully. InSAR data clearly show the precursors of the slope failure in the source area of the Maoxian landslide, with a maximum displacement rate detected of 27 mm/year along the line of sight of the satellite. Deformation time series of measurement points identified within the main scarp of the landslide exhibit an acceleration starting from April 2017. A detailed time series analysis leads to the classification of different deformation behaviours. The Fukuzono method for forecasting the time of failure appear to be applicable to the displacement data exhibiting progressive acceleration. Results suggest that satellite radar data, systematically acquired over large areas with short revisiting time, could be used not only as a tool for mapping unstable areas, but also for landslide monitoring, at least for some typologies of sliding phenomena."

Although delayed juvenile dispersal occurs in non-cooperative breeders, studies investigating family formation in these species are rare. Juveniles delay natal dispersal in response to ecological constraints of dispersal and/or benefits of philopatry, with parents predicted to adjust their tolerance towards independent offspring according to their direct fitness benefits. Consequently, precocial chick development is often associated with low parental care and short family association. White-breasted mesites (Mesitornis variegata) are group-living but non-cooperatively breeding birds that live in saturated habitats, whose semi-precocial young exhibit large variation in the timing of natal dispersal. We investigated whether the development of foraging skills of nutritionally independent juvenile mesites affects their dispersal decisions. Additionally, because parents show aggression towards older offspring particularly around the subsequent breeding season, we studied whether family-living is costly for parents. Our results indicate that juveniles develop their foraging skills slowly, that juveniles with poorer foraging skills tend to disperse later, and that adults experience foraging and reproductive costs from extended juvenile association. Therefore, it may be beneficial for less skilled juveniles to remain longer in the safety of the family when breeding vacancies are scarce. Furthermore, parental costs of family-living may trigger parental aggression towards juveniles, resulting in the dissolution of families and the lack of cooperative breeding in this species. This study highlights the importance of cost-benefit analyses from both the parents' and offspring's perspective to understand family stability and, hence, evolutionary routes towards cooperative breeding."
"Zhou, You; Radford, Andrew N.; Magrath, Robert D.","Why does noise reduce response to alarm calls? Experimental assessment of masking, distraction and greater vigilance in wild birds",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,33,1280,1289,10.1111/1365-2435.13333,2019,"1. Environmental noise from anthropogenic and other sources affects many aspects of animal ecology and behaviour, including acoustic communication. Acoustic masking is often assumed in field studies to be the cause of compromised communication in noise, but other mechanisms could have similar effects.2. We tested experimentally how background noise disrupted the response to conspecific alarm calls in wild superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus, assessing the effects of acoustic masking, distraction and changes in vigilance. We first examined the birds' response to alarm-call playbacks accompanied by different amplitudes of background noise that overlapped the calls in acoustic frequency. We then scored and videoed their response to alarm calls in two types of background noise, that did or did not overlap call frequency, but were broadcast at a constant amplitude.3. Birds were less likely to flee to alarm calls in higher amplitudes of overlapping noise, demonstrating that noise itself compromised communication independently of environmental correlates. Background noise affected the response only if it overlapped in frequency with the alarm calls, implying that the effect was not due to distraction. Further, birds were equally vigilant during background noise of overlapping or non-overlapping frequency, indicating that the lack of response to alarm calls in overlapping noise was not due to enhanced vigilance and awareness that there was no predator.4. We conclude that alarm-call reception was compromised by masking, a mechanism that is often assumed but rarely tested in an ecological context. Masking compromised reception of high-frequency aerial alarm calls and so could reduce survival in background noise of similar frequency. While anthropogenic noise, which is often of lower frequency, is unlikely to affect communication with these calls, it could affect reception of acoustic cues of danger, or other conspecific or heterospecific alarm calls."

We studied antipredator behavior of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) and western gray kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) on Kangaroo Island (KI), South Australia, and at Tutanning Nature Reserve on the mainland of western Australia. Both species on KI have been isolated from native mammalian predators for several thousand years. On KI, wallabies (because of their size) are vulnerable to diurnal aerial predators. In contrast, on the mainland both species have been exposed continuously to native and introduced mammalian and avian predators. At both locations, wallabies modified the amount of time they allocated to vigilance and foraging in response to group size, whereas kangaroos did so only at the higher risk Tutanning site. Both species modified overall time budgets (they were warier at the higher risk site), and both species modified space-use patterns as a function of risk. At the higher risk site, tammars were closer to cover, whereas kangaroos were, on average, farther from cover. We hypothesize that the presence of a single predator, even if it is active at a different time of day, may profoundly affect the way a species responds to the loss of other predators by maintaining certain antipredator behaviors. Such an effect of ancestral predators may be expected as long as species encounter some predators."

Both visual obstructions and background noise can reduce detectability of predators, which may increase reliance on social information, such as from alarm calls. Furthermore, a combination of visual and auditory constraints might greatly increase reliance on social information, because the loss of information from one source cannot be compensated by the other. Testing these possibilities requires manipulating personal information while broadcasting alarm calls. We therefore experimentally tested the effects of a visual barrier, traffic noise, and their combination on the response of Australian magpies, Cracticus tibicen, to heterospecific alarm calls. The barrier blocked only visual cues, while playback of moderate traffic noise could mask subtle acoustic cues of danger, such as of a predator's movement, but not the alarm-call playback. We predicted that response to alarm calls would increase with either visual or acoustic constraint, and that there would be a disproportionate response when both were present. As predicted, individuals responded more strongly to alarm calls when there was a visual barrier. However, moderate traffic noise did not affect responses, and the effect of the visual barrier was not greater during traffic-noise playback. We conclude that a reduction of personal, visual information led to a greater reliance on social information from alarm calls, confirming indirect evidence from other species. The absence of a traffic-noise effect could be because in Australian magpies hearing subtle cues is less important than vision in detecting predators."

It starts with the argument that structural considerations (often linked to trait concepts) and processing considerations (often linked to situational demands and actual behavior) are not fundamentally in opposition, but that global and uncontextualized trait concepts (e.g., trait anxiety) require revision to incorporate cognitive-affective units such as appraisals, goals, or self-regulatory competencies (cf. Mischel, 2004). The article then presents a personality-oriented coping theory (the model of coping modes; MCM; Hock & Krohne, 2004; Krohne, 1993, 2003) which attempts to incorporate these units. The MCM distinguishes vigilant (uncertainty-oriented) and cognitively avoidant (arousal-oriented) coping processes and views them as dispositional preferences related to personality. Empirical evidence (based on cognitive-experimental designs in the fields of attentional orientation and the interpretation and retrieval of ambiguous and aversive information) is reviewed and supports central assumptions of the theory.

Parental investment in vigilance and defence of offspring progressively decreased during the post-fledging dependence period. The number of feeds was also slightly reduced towards the end of the period. However, this does not seem to be the main factor which leads to juvenile independence. The fact that the family rupture is sudden and that the post-fledging dependence period tends to shorten as the season progresses suggests that juvenile and adult migratory urgency may be as important a factor as reduced parental investment in breaking the family ties."

Daily activities of the family group are highly synchronized and individuals maintain a spacial proximity throughout the day. Adult females initiate and lead most group travel including flight from potential danger. Klipspringer avoid predators through frequent vigilance, especially by adult males, and loud duetted alarm calls by the adult pair.

While outside, adult bears were inactive 49.5% of the time, whereas cubs were inactive 13.4% of the time. We found no significant relationships between den emergence activity and weather.

However, the duration of vigilance behaviors at sites near industrial activity was not significantly shorter than at the other sites studied (t = -1.8902, df = 4, p = 0.07).

Samples were obtained from 10 different study sites where Coots fed both on water and on land (N=139 feeding-bouts). Flock structure differed significantly between feeding methods, and nearest-neighbor distance was lower on land (water: 5.2 +/- 0.3 Coot length, land: 2.8 +/- 0.2 Coot length). Mean feeding-bout length-defined as the time of uninterrupted feeding-was significantly different (water: 12.2 +/- 0.8 s, land: 9.4 +/- 0.8 s). When Using the study sites as samples, aquatic feeding-bouts were also significantly longer. In a general linear mixed model a significant influence of feeding method on feeding-bout length was found, again with a higher font length in the water. Feeding-bout lengths were positively correlated between aquatic and terrestrial feeding within the same study site. These results suggest that Coots perceived more safety during aquatic feeding which was reflected in longer feeding-bouts."

Drinking under the risk of predation may elicit similar prey behaviours to those in foraging animals, but has been little studied. Agile wallabies, Macropus agilis, manipulate their environment by excavating drinking holes just out of reach of predatory saltwater crocodiles. Paradoxically, however, some wallabies drink from the river's edge despite the immediate availability of the lower-risk drinking holes. We studied the behaviour of wallabies with multiple drinking options to test a series of predictions for animals drinking under the risk of predation. More wallabies drank during the day than at night, regardless of drinking site. However, night-drinking wallabies were much more likely to use the excavated holes than the 'riskier' river. This spatiotemporal dichotomy in perceived predation risk may reflect a mismatch in nocturnal sensory capabilities between predator and prey, and would provide sufficient motivation for wallabies to create low-risk drinking holes. Drinking duration, our surrogate for harvest, was not influenced by drinking site type ( hole versus river), drinking time or social context (solitary versus group), suggesting that some animals may not forego drinking during high-risk periods, as predicted and observed for some foraging animals. Compared to wallabies in groups, solitary wallabies were less likely to drink from the river, especially at night, and were more vigilant. Although evidence is limited, our research suggests that vigilance may be ineffective for nocturnally drinking wallabies in the face of this concealed, ambush predator.

We compared the estimates of FID and AD under ideal conditions (i.e. of black swans, Cygnus atratus, a large species with obvious behaviour, and at a location where swans allowed close approaches in open habitats), by one experienced and four inexperienced observers.Key results. FID did not differ among observers but AD differed between the experienced and all inexperienced observers, and among inexperienced observers. Thus, FID estimates appear more repeatable than those of AD. Experience apparently results in more conservative estimates of AD.Conclusions. FID represents a repeatable measure that is consistent across observers. This study supports its broad application in the study of wildlife escape behaviour.Implications.

Predator targeting of specific prey during attacks determines how danger is distributed among group members, and thereby determines key aspects of the safety of feeding in groups, such as risk dilution and its relationship to antipredator vigilance. During the main experiment, a model hawk suddenly appeared at either 3 m or 9 m from finches feeding near protective cover. The 9 m attacks always caused nearly all birds to flee to cover. During 3 m attacks, only birds directly in the line of attack fled to cover; the other birds instead consistently flew nearly perpendicular to the attack and away from cover. These results suggest that most finches did not perceive themselves to be targeted for attack when the hawk appeared at close range; otherwise, all birds appeared to perceive themselves as potential targets. A second experiment demonstrated that information about predator targeting is derived from observation of the predator itself rather than the behaviour of flockmates in the direct line of attack. A third experiment demonstrated that distance to cover also influenced the birds' response to targeting; thus, reactions to apparent nontargeting were not simply a matter of moving away from the line of attack. The differential perception of targeting during an attack is probably a widespread phenomenon in social birds and other animals. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The otters displayed less swimming and resting, less sleeping and more begging, vocalisations and overall vigilance in winter compared to summer, suggesting more hunger due to increased energetic demands for thermoregulation. The introduction of an additional mid-morning feed in winter without increasing the total amount of food per day was only partly effective on the targeted behaviours. The overall vigilance displays and vocalisations increased significantly, resting and sleeping decreased, but begging did not change compared to previous winter and summer values. Begging before the feed at 14:00 hours was less frequent, suggesting less hunger at this time, but increased to higher values later in the afternoon. An increase in the total amount of food per day from 20% to 30% of otter body weight in January 2019, with return to 3 feeds/day, was more effective at reducing the targeted behaviours. There were decreases in overall vigilance displays and in the frequencies of begging and short calls and increases in play behaviours, social affiliative interactions and resting and sleeping, suggesting a reduction in levels of hunger and related stress. This study emphasized the importance of considering how local climate affects enclosure conditions when assessing the nutritional, enrichment and climatisation needs of Asian small-clawed otters."

Beyond alerting others and maintaining that state of alertness, however, repetitive signal elements may be parsed so as to encode information about the nature of potential threats. To determine how call length and variation in intersyllable latency might prove informative in the repetitive alarm vocalizations of Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii), we conducted a field-based playback experiment quantifying antipredator responses to manipulated alarm calls. Free-living juvenile squirrels were exposed to playbacks of 12 syllable (long) and six syllable (short) calls with a constant (monotonous) or changing (variable) call rate. The length of calls had no significant effect on the behaviour of call recipients during and immediately after call production; however, call recipients showed greater vigilance after the playback of monotonous calls than after variable calls. The absence of a call length effect is not consistent with tonic communication in the strict sense; rather, enhanced responsiveness to monotonous relative to variable calls suggests that multiple syllables, and the emergent patterns of intersyllable latency, communicate information about response urgency or the distance to a predatory threat. Only monotonous calls convey those aspects with any certainty on the part of the signaller and hence are selectively attended to by receivers."

We used novel mini-GPS technology and time local convex hull analyses to determine how golden-mantled ground squirrels (Callospermophilus lateralis) use a spatiotemporal strategy to optimize foraging early in the year when individuals are in an energy deficit. By using serial correlation from GPS data, we could better understand how individuals use a time management strategy influenced by distance traveled from the burrow, location of food patches, location of refuge patches, and vegetative cover type. Individuals maximized time spent in food patches rather than in travel corridors or at the burrow, suggesting the need to forage was prioritized. Individuals spent more time at patches farther from the burrow relative to nearer patches, potentially as a function of intermittent antipredator vigilance activity and energy optimization. Individuals also had high rates of revisitation, but low visit duration, in risky canopy cover types, suggesting that individuals used areas of low vegetative understory cover to travel efficiently between high-value food patches. Increased predation risk incurred while traveling in these open areas was possibly offset by use of refuges. Understanding these spatiotemporal movement patterns and how they relate to dynamic intrinsic and extrinsic demands has the potential to redefine optimal foraging behavior and better inform management and conservation practices."

However, few studies have rigorously assessed the adaptive value of physiological and behavioural rhythms in animals. We laid the groundwork for an assessment of the adaptive rhythm hypothesis by assaying diel rhythms of foraging and antipredator behaviour in the trashline orb-weaver Cyclosa turbinata (Araneae: Araneidae). When confronted with a predator stimulus in experimental arenas, C. turbinata showed thanatosis behaviour more frequently and for longer durations during the day. However, assays of antipredator response within webs revealed more complex diel patterns of avoidance behaviours and no pattern of avoidance behaviour duration. A preliminary assay of prey capture behaviour suggested that C. turbinata also shows nocturnal patterns of foraging aggression. A refined foraging experiment, in which we randomized prey stimulus frequency, found that time of day and spider ID strongly predicted the likelihood of showing prey capture behaviour. Only spider ID predicted latency to attack the prey stimulus despite low individual repeatability (r = 0.10). These results support our prediction that C. turbinata modulate foraging aggression over the diel cycle, but we found no evidence of a trade-off between foraging behaviour and predator vigilance. However, overall patterns of vigilance may be masked by diel changes in antipredator strategies that correspond to fluctuations in the relative abundances of predator types.

"Treves, A",Has predation shaped the social systems of arboreal primates?,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,20,35,67,10.1023/A:1020532216737,1999,"I studied antipredator behavior in two species of monkeys to elucidate the role of predation in shaping the social systems of arboreal primates. I compared the responses of monkeys to auditory and visual contact with predators to response elicited by sound playback experiments using the recorded calls of predators. Changes in vigilance and aggregation persisting up to 30 min after predator encounter occurred in both cases. Measures of vigilance shed light on individual perceptions of risk while aggregation measures-intragroup spatial cohesion and polyspecific associations-permit direct inference about the protective benefits of grouping for the monkeys. They responded to real predator encounters and simulations in similar ways. Thus, sound playbacks of predator vocalizations are effective to simulate predator proximity. Contrary to predictions, predator encounters did not lead invariably to increased cohesion within groups or to increased time spent vigilant. Moreover behavior in polyspecific associations was no different from that in single-species groups. Only red colobus encountering chimpanzees behaved as predicted by increasing vigilance and intragroup cohesion. The red colobus social system may have developed to protect against chimpanzee attack. In contrast, red-tailed monkey encounters with raptors and chimpanzees involved no change in time spent vigilant, coupled with decreases in intragroup cohesion. I conclude that predation is not a uniform selective pressure and patterns of social behavior within groups do not predict antipredator behavior."

In contrast to fully domesticated species, there is still a lack of studies on the behaviour of deer under farm conditions and their response to changes in their environment. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the behaviour of fallow deer after the introduction of the novel object (NO) into the enclosure. The herd was observed at the most frequently visited part of the enclosure, i.e. the foraging area near the feeding station. We installed several different Non-animal NOs (abstract object/installation, camping chair, colourful boxes) and Animal NO (animal-shaped toy) with intervening Controls (periods without NO). Results generally showed that time spent at the foraging area decreased in the presence of NO (p < 0.05). This effect was significantly stronger when NO had an animal shape (horse-shaped toy), with the frequency of animal appearance also being lower with frequent complete absence of animals at the foraging area. However, diurnal rhythm of animal appearance did not differ, nor did group size. When looking at the ratio among different behaviours that animals performed in the foraging area (movement, stationary, feeding), we found no differences between the Control and Non-animal NO (feeding 42-43 %, stationary 38-39 %). However, in the presence of Animal NO, feeding behaviours increased significantly (57 %), while the stationary behaviours decreased significantly (24 %). While resting predominated among stationary behaviours in the Control and Non-animal NO treatments (72-75 %), vigilance represented the most stationary behaviours in the presence of Animal NO (58 %). Movement was consistently performed to the same extent (18-20 %). Therefore, the presence of the novel object reduced foraging activity and increased vigilance in fallow deer, and deer breeders should consider this. Avoidance of the foraging area within the enclosure, where animals have fewer alternative food sources, can be particularly problematic. Therefore, preventing or disturbing their regular foraging routine should be minimized to meet basic welfare requirements."

This geophagy has probable health benefits, such as mineral supplementation or gastrointestinal tract protection, and is likely to be an important behavior for a species' ecology, health, diet, and conservation. We investigated geophagy in the Critically Endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Lagothrix flavicauda). We collected observational data and camera trap records over 2 years at La Esperanza study site, northern Peru. Geophagy was rare, with 67 events recorded during the study. All age/sex classes engaged in geophagy, but adult males spent significantly less time consuming earthin situthan adult females did. Geophagy occurred predominantly during the dry season and was a solitary behavior. The forest floor is presumably a high-risk environment for these predominantly arboreal Primates and our study animals employed various strategies to minimize predation risk. These included using a single route to access and leave geophagy sites, displaying increased vigilance behaviors before and during geophagy events, and minimizing the time spent on the forest floor (mean: 15 [plus or minus] SD 9 s). They also maximized the benefits of being on the forest floor by removing earth to consumeex situ.These findings provide the first steps in the systemic approach required to understand the role geophagy plays in our study species, whose almost exclusive arboreality, coupled with the increased predation risk associated with terrestriality, suggests that geophagy confers an important benefit."

Adult RGS spent a greater proportion of time vigilant in response to two vs. one calling squirrel, whereas juvenile RGS did not respond differentially to two vs. one caller. Apparently then, the relative inexperience of juvenile RGS with alarm calls and the context in which such calls are emitted precludes their enumeration of alarm callers. Taken together with our earlier finding that adult but not juvenile RGS ignore information regarding response urgency encoded in the rate of juvenile produced repetitive calls, our present results suggest a developmental shift in response-urgency perception. Adult RGS selectively extract information regarding response urgency via discrimination of the number of callers, ignoring less reliable information encoded in the rate of repetitive calls issued by inexperienced juvenile signallers."

We examined responses of starlings to the presence of conspecifics by manipulating foraging-group density experimentally, while ensuring that each subject's foraging opportunities were unchanged. To do this, we used individuals foraging simultaneously in four bottomless enclosures placed at various separations in natural foraging grounds. We measured foraging and scanning intensity and qualitative aspects of scanning of focal individuals. Additionally, we examined the temporal distribution of scanning between individuals. The focal individual analysis showed that (1) food-searching activity increased, while time spent scanning, time off the ground and scanning bout length decreased with flock density; (2) food finding per unit of searching effort increased with density; (3) head orientation during scanning was sensitive to companions' proximity: heads pointed away from the companions at close distance, toward them at intermediate distance, and was random farther away. The analysis of the (temporal overlapping in scanning) temporal distribution of scanning for the group showed that scanning was significantly synchronized when companions were adjacent to each other but was not significantly different from random at further separations. We conclude that behavioral responses of individuals to the presence of others generate important changes in foraging performance even in the absence of physical interference and, more generally, that assessing the mechanisms that control the behavior of group members at different flock densities offers a way to understand the functional and ecological significance of foraging aggregations."

This prospecting behaviour has been described in many bird species. However, the nature of the information gathered by prospectors often remains unknown. We collected data on prospecting behaviour in the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, a small hole-nesting passerine bird, to investigate whether prospectors could gather information on their conspecifics' reproductive success, that is, 'public information'. If they could, they would be expected to inspect conspecific nests, prospect at the time when public information is reliable, and be attracted to, and spend time at, successful sites. Prospecting at conspecific nests was frequent. Prospectors were mainly males, and prospecting activity closely matched the peak of nesting activity. The probability of observing a prospector at a nest increased with parental activity, measured by feeding rate and vigilance behaviour, but did not depend on direct measures of success of the inspected nest (nestling number and condition), or on female characteristics. Because feeding rate and vigilance behaviour were predictors of breeding success at fledging, prospectors were attracted to the most successful nests when cueing on conspicuous parental activity. Therefore, prospectors could gather accurate information on local conspecific reproductive success that may be used for breeding patch choice in the following year. We discuss alternative explanations for our results, and the need to test experimentally whether prospectors gather public information. We also discuss the role of breeding constraints on, and the origin of sex differences in, prospecting. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, reintroductions and shifting conservation attitudes have lead to some population repatriations. Since the ecological consequences of predation may relate to indirect effects of predation risk, reconstruction of carnivore ecosystem function could depend on adequate predator recognition by prey. We evaluated behavioral responses in naive and lion exposed impala (Aepyceros melampus), blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), and warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) to audio calls of a native (African lion Panthera leo) and an alien (grey wolf Canis lupus) predator as well as to unfamiliar (music) and familiar (running water) neutral controls. Our results demonstrated stronger behavioral responses to lions than to any of the other calls, even in naive populations, and suggest that retained predator recognition may enable rapid reconstruction of carnivore ecosystem function throughout Africa. However, since recognition may be lost in large increments, we urge that carnivore repatriations should be a prioritized component of African ecosystem conservation."

Several secondary iron minerals are precipitated in these settings that can be detected via remote sensing applications. The purpose of this research is to investigate the capacity of hyperspectral analysis to determine the abundance of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)-indicator secondary iron minerals in mine sites with the guidance of ground truth information. To this end, we focus on an abandoned coal mine site in Turkey to detect secondary iron minerals associated with AMD via multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery, in accordance with the laboratory analysis of fieldcollected samples through X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Inductive Coupled Plasma (ICP), and ASD spectral analysis. In relation with the conducted laboratory XRD and ICP results, the proposed methodology first reveals the iron-induced absorption feature located between 700 and 900 nm on field-collected ASD spectra and reference USGS spectra through a baseline method, namely parabola fitting method. The subsequent remote sensing analysis then applies hyperspectral unmixing to Sentinel-2 imagery and identifies the spectral endmember indicating iron-absorption behavior by computing its spectral angle distance to reference spectra. The experiments reveal that while the iron absorption characteristics are not apparent in pixel spectra, the utilized unmixing methodology enables capturing of those features at sub-pixel level on the resulting endmembers. Second, the comparison between the calculated abundances with unmixing and iron levels obtained with ground based ICP analysis indicate coherent correlation values. Finally, among the utilized unmixing methods, the performance of SISAL is found better than MVSA with the resulting correlation values of 0.76 and 0.63, respectively, while also returning closer endmembers to the reference iron spectra. The performed research demonstrates the potential of hyperspectral applications on Sentinel-2 data to uncover the sub-pixel iron-induced spectral features in the visible region, proving compatible results between the spectral and laboratory analysis."

However, due to sleep inertia, impaired performance immediately upon waking is typical. We investigated the impact of a preceding stressor (an alarm/mobilisation procedure) on sleepiness and performance upon waking. Healthy, adult males (n = 16) attended the sleep laboratory for four consecutive nights which included two, counterbalanced on-call sleeps where participants were woken at 04:00 h by (a) an alarm/mobilisation procedure (Alarm) or (b) gently by a researcher (Control). Following waking was a 2-h testing session comprising the repeated administration of the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and 5-min Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Results from within-subjects analysis of variance in both the Control and Alarm conditions showed that for subjective sleepiness (KSS) there was a significant fixed effect of time (p = 0.012), with participants becoming less sleepy as time post-wake increased. In terms of PVT performance outcomes, in neither the Alarm or Control conditions were there measurable signs of sleep inertia with performance remaining stable across the 2-h testing period. Based on previous research measuring impact of sleep inertia when woken near the circadian nadir, performance findings in particular were unexpected. We propose that stress caused by study procedures (i.e. finger pricks using lancets) unrelated to the simulated wake-up protocols may have countered any impact of sleep inertia on performance."

This coordination may rely on intrapair acoustic communication, which is surprisingly poorly understood. Here we examined the impact of an increased level of background noise on intrapair acoustic communication at the nest in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. We monitored how partners adapted their acoustic interactions in response to a playback of wind noise inside the nestbox during incubation. Both zebra finch parents incubate and use coordinated call duets when they meet at the nest. The incubating parent can vocalize to its partner either outside the nestbox (sentinel duets) or inside the nestbox (relief and visit duets), depending on the context of the meeting. Pairs use these duets to communicate on predation threats (sentinel duets), incubation duties (relief) and other nesting activities (visit duets). Each of these duets probably represents a critical component of pair coordination. In response to the noise playback, partners called less and more rapidly during visit and relief duets. Female and male calls were more regularly and precisely alternated during relief duets. Mates increased the number of visit duets and their spatial proximity during sentinel duets. Furthermore, both females and males produced louder, higher-frequency and less broadband calls. Taken together our results show that birds use several strategies to adjust to noise during incubation, underlining the importance of effective intrapair communication for breeding pairs.

In precocial birds, where the young feed themselves, the costs and benefits of brood size are still poorly understood. An experimental manipulation of brood size was employed to examine the effects of brood size on both parents and young in a wild population of barnacle geese [Branta leucopsis (Bechstein)] during brood-rearing on Svalbard.2. Social dominance of the family unit, the amount of vigilance behaviour of the parents, the growth of the goslings in the family unit and an index of body condition for female parents during moult were all positively correlated with brood size.3. When brood size changed as a result of natural events (i.e. predation or adoption) or experimental manipulation, rates of dominance, parental vigilance, gosling growth and female parent condition changed in a similar direction to the observed relation between the variable and brood size in unchanged broods.4. After fledging, the fast-growing goslings in large broods survived better during autumn migration, while there was no apparent net cost in survival or next-year breeding for the parents.5. Via a direct effect of brood size on dominance of the family unit, large broods were beneficial for both parent and young in a situation where there was strong intraspecific competition for the available food resources.6. This study provides a clear demonstration of a causal relationship between brood size and various components of both gosling and adult fitness and is of direct relevance to the phenomenon of adoption and the evolution of brood size in this species."
"Hogstad, Olav",Winter flock coherence in Willow Tits - who decide what and why,Ornis Norvegica,32,190,201,,2009,"Willow Tits Poecile montana (Parus montanus) spend the non-breeding season in mixed-age flocks consisting most often of one social dominant adult mated pair that remain in their territory for the whole of their lives. together with two or four subordinate unrelated first-year birds that have settled after a post-natal dispersal. Since the adults expel the subordinates from the safer parts of the trees in term of predation, juveniles forage in more favourable microhabitats after the flocks temporarily have split into age-specific sub-flocks. However, due to the effect of many eyes, each individual may spend less time scanning for predators and more time foraging when being in a big flock rather than in a small one. To find whether adults or juveniles initiate the splitting into age-specific sub-flocks and set the flock coherence. I followed 6-10 different flocks yearly over nine winters.Independent of ambient temperature, adult Willow Tits were the first to leave the flock when foraging in the same tree more often than juveniles, whereas juveniles left the flock more often in mild weather (>= 6 degrees C) than in cold (< 6 degrees C). When the adult left the flock first, juveniles followed the adult more often in cold than in mild Weather, more frequently so within 12 hours than later. After being split into adult and juvenile flocks, the juveniles moved towards and accompanied adults, not the other way round. Juveniles apparently applied for adult company and mostly decided the flock size, When one of the adults left the flock first, its mate followed as the second bird more often than any of the other flock members. In mild weather, when adult and juveniles foraged in separate sub-flocks, dominant adults had no influence on the behaviour of the juveniles that foraged mostly in the upper half of pines, an area supposed to be less exposed to predators. When in company with adults and differing in space use, the juveniles used more time for vigilance and less for foraging than adults. but did not differ in foraging and vigilance time without the company of the alpha pair.Although company of dominant adults may be disadvantageous for the subordinate juvenile flock members, juveniles capitalize on the greater experience of the adults and provide more time to foraging due to a greater anti-predation benefit due to vigilance reduction because of the effect of many eyes. However , most important: because the habitat is probably saturated with dominant territory owners, flock membership of juveniles is the main route to territory ownership and probably their only chance to breed at the site the following spring. Juvenile Willow Tits that do not succeed in achieving a flock membership during summer and autumn, may leave the area and take part in long-distance movements, settle in a suboptimal habitat or live as floaters that switch among several flocks, alternatives apparently being fatal."
"Yosef, Reuven",Individual distances among Greater Flamingos as indicators of tourism pressure,Waterbirds,23,26,31,10.2307/1522143,2000,"One of the greatest challenges facing ecologists and conservationists is to ensure the continued coexistence of wildlife with the increasing pressure of human recreation. In birds, the use of flock members to reduce individual levels of vigilance has been the focus of many studies that have tried to explain the relationship among vigilance, group size, and distance to cover by using foraging or preening as indicators of disturbance. To avoid the confounding variables associated with foraging and preening, in this study I observed the effects of increasing levels of human disturbance on vigilance by measuring distances among individuals in flocks of Greater Flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus). Reactions to 112 disturbances were recorded during 61 hr of observation. Undisturbed flamingos exhibited no relationship between individual distance and flock size. When joggers appeared, birds became alert but continued to feed. Individual distance was not influenced by flock size when motor vehicles (jeeps) drove past, but was different in value from that in undisturbed flocks. However, when tour groups stopped and the occupants got out of vehicles, individual distance was significantly reduced and flock size positively influenced flock cohesiveness (i.e., smaller flocks had smaller individual distance values than large flocks). Flamingos appeared to be especially disturbed by all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), and in 82% of the encounters they flew away. In these cases, flock cohesiveness was extremely dense, but flock size did not influence flock reaction. This study demonstrated that flocking species seek protection in numbers, but they leave an area when insufficient conspecifics are present and when serious disturbance occurs."

Here, our aims were: (a) to investigate the relationships between temperament dimensions obtained through behavioral tests and the social rank of white-eyed parakeets (Psittacara leucophthalmus), and (b) to evaluate the relationships between temperament dimensions with social and non-social behaviors in group-housing captivity. Three temperament tests were applied for each parakeet singly: reaction to an unknown person, novel object, and reaction to potential predator tests. Bird's behaviors during the tests were recorded, generating 13 behavioral variables to which a factor analysis was applied to extract the main dimensions of parakeets' temperament. Social rank was obtained through the observation of aggressive social interactions for animals kept in groups of four individuals, recording the winner and loser of each event. To extract the dominance hierarchy, we used the Elo-rating and David's index of dominance (as higher values are more dominant). Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to investigate the relationships between temperament dimensions with social rank and parakeets' behaviors in group-housing captivity obtained with the two methods. Individual differences in parakeets in three main temperament dimensions were described ('vigilance', 'boldness', and 'responsiveness to humans'). David's score was significantly correlated with 'boldness' (r = 0.63), and a trend was found for Elo-rating (r = 0.54). For the 'vigilance' dimension, dominant parakeets based on David's score (r = 0.53) and Elo-rating (r = 0.55) tended to be more vigilant. Temperament was also related to the behavioral categories in group-housing captivity. Bold parakeets spent more time in preening (r = 0.56), had a higher frequency of negative social interactions (r = 0.64), and tended to spend less time interacting with the environment (r = 0.51). Vigilant parakeets had a lower frequency of positive social interactions (r = 0.55) and spent a lower percentage of time in locomotion (r = 0.55). In conclusion, the temperament dimensions obtained for parakeets through behavioral tests were related to their social rank and the behaviors in group-housing captivity. For captive social psittacids, such as those in rescue centers, temperament could prove useful in decisions about choosing individuals to be housed together, because temperament allows inferences about the dominance of the individuals, avoiding unnecessary disputes and injuries inside the aviaries."
"Barbosa, A",The effects of predation risk on scanning and flocking behavior in Dunlin,JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY,68,607,612,,1997,"Dunlin (Calidris alpina) scanning and flocking behavior was studied in two habitats with different predation risk. Mean flock size, time spent scanning, and mean scan duration were higher in rice fields (dhe less profitable and high-risk habitat) than in littoral habitats (the more profitable and low-risk habitat), although vigilance rate was not different between habitats. Increased scanning and flocking behavior probably increase efficency in predator avoidance. The results are explained as behavioral changes to ensure safety in a high predation-risk situation when starvation risk is also present."

These effects explained up to 79% of the variation in the behaviors. Marmots allocated more time (40-60%, 110-265 min daily) above-ground to sitting/lying than to any other activity. Foraging was the other major activity (12-23%, 37 to 94 min daily). Vigilance/alert varied from 1.1 to 14.5% and from 12.0 to 71.7 min daily. Social status affected the time budget, especially time allocated to vigilance/alert. All other behaviors averaged about 5% or less except for out-of-sight and enter-burrow. The adult male cohort spent significantly more time above-ground than all other cohorts and reproductive females allocated significantly more time to foraging than the other cohorts. The amount of time spent above-ground decreased linearly from the down-river site to the up-river site. The proportion of time spent above-ground was significantly less at mid day than in the morning or afternoon. Above-ground activity was lowest during gestation, increased during lactation, remained high during early post-lactation, and declined during the final season-period. The following significant relationships common to the three colonies suggest species characteristics or common environmental influences: ; more time allocated to foraging and foraging-vigilance in the afternoon and more time allocated to foraging-alert, alert, and locomotion during gestation and lactation than during post-lactation. Marmots adjust their behaviors according to prevailing conditions. The remaining significant relationships can be attributed to specific age-sex cohorts or to habitat differences. Because marmots allocate so much time to sitting/lying, we suggest that energy budgets are not constrained by foraging time but by time required to process ingested food. Similarly, time spent vigilant/alert does not seem to constrain energy intake. Social behavior is not limited by time, but could easily be expanded by spending less time inactive. In general, there do not seem to be tradeoffs among activities. Among other species of ground-dwelling sciurids, social behavior occupies a small proportion of the time budget, but the amount of time allocated to foraging and sitting/lying varies widely."

Field trials with sentinel eggs of C. miles were conducted in SW Spain oak forests in which O. rudnevi was known to occur, using as positive controls sentinel eggs of both Cerambyx (Cerambyx) cerdo Linnaeus, 1758, and Cerambyx (Cerambyx) welensii (Kuster, 1845), the only two O. rudnevi hosts known to date. Laboratory assays were conducted using non-choice tests and choice tests (C. miles vs. C. cerdo). Results showed that C. miles eggs were attacked and successfully parasitised by O. rudnevi in the wild, uncorrected parasitism rates (P-U) being similar to those of C. cerdo and C. welensii (2.2-5.2%), and net parasitism rates (P-N) even significantly higher in C. miles (8.9%) than in C. welensii (3.3%). Interestingly, C. miles sentinel eggs were parasitised in holm oak forests in which C. miles was unknown to occur, suggesting that egg-derived volatile cues were important in host location. In the laboratory, non-choice tests showed no differences in P-N among C. miles, C. cerdo and C. welensii (80-88%), signifying that O. rudnevi performed alike in the three hosts. Choice tests showed that O. rudnevi did not exhibit host preference between C. miles (53%) and C. cerdo (47%). Similar tests proved that eggs of Cerambyx (Microcerambyx) scopolii Fuessly, 1775, and Prinobius myardi Mulsant, 1842, were never selected as hosts by O. rudnevi. Our results and the chorological, ecological and phylogenetic available evidence suggest that O. rudnevi behaves as an oligophagous egg parasitoid, which could be associated to other Cerambyx (s. str.) species over the Western Palaearctic realm."

In Fennoscandia, the endangered arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is subject to increasing tourism interest and some regions recommend a minimum approach distance of 300 m, but the guidelines have not been scientifically validated. We conducted experimental human approaches towards arctic fox den sites to study activity and behavioral changes in response to the approaching observer. The first arctic foxes hid when approached within 300 m, but many had increased their vigilance already at the start distance of 500 m. At approximately 200 m, the hiding probability increased rapidly at dens disturbed and undisturbed by tourism activities. Arctic foxes at disturbed dens allowed the observer to approach more closely before they increased their vigilance and before they hid compared to foxes at undisturbed dens. We confirm that a minimum distance of 300 m might be sufficient for most arctic foxes to refrain from hiding, but a longer distance would be required to avoid causing any disturbance. We recommend a minimum approach distance of >= 300 m to be implemented in all Fennoscandian regions inhabited by the arctic fox. (c) 2020 The Wildlife Society."

Understanding specific responses to disturbances can help conservation management better protect wildlife populations to coexist with local communities. Here, we studied the response of a model ungulate species, the impala (Aepyceros melampus), to different types of human activities in the Serengeti ecosystem. Impala were studied in central Serengeti National Park (CSNP), an area with relatively low human disturbance, and, with increasing levels of human disturbance, in western Serengeti National Park (WSNP), Grumeti Game Reserve (GGR), Ikona Wildlife Management Area (IWMA), and Loliondo Game Controlled Area (LGCA); pastoralism and/or hunting are the main disturbances in these areas. We hypothesised that in the exploited GGR, IWMA and LGCA areas, 1) impala would spend more time on costly behaviours, 2) sex ratios would be more female skewed, and 3) group sizes, reproduction and recruitment ratios would be lower compared to CSNP. We found that impala spent less time resting in IWMA and LGCA, as well as a significantly lower proportion of males, and lower reproduction and recruitment ratios in LGCA. Impala synchronized their behaviour, increasing their social cohesion potentially resulting in more efficient anti-predator strategies. Human activities induced a behavioural response in impala, indicating that in less regulated areas where pastoralism and hunting are allowed, these disturbances can potentially affect impala population persistence. These results highlight the importance of protected areas for wildlife populations, and the need for continuous monitoring of the impala and other ungulate populations in less regulated areas, as the underlying anthropogenic disturbances are likely impacting diverse species.

Tick-removal grooming is regulated both by a central control mechanism (programmed grooming model) and by cutaneous stimulation from tick bites (stimulus-driven model). The programmed grooming model predicts that organismic factors that impact the cost-benefit ratio of grooming (e.g., sex and body size) will influence the rate of grooming. The 'vigilance principle' predicts that breeding males of sexually dimorphic species will groom less than females to maintain high levels of vigilance for rival males and oestrus females. The intraspecific body size principle predicts that juveniles will engage in more frequent grooming than larger-bodied adults to compensate for the higher cost of tick infestation for smaller animals. To examine the generalizability of these predictions, we surveyed the grooming rate of 53 species/subspecies of ungulates (primarily Bovidae and Cervidae) in tick-free zoological parks in which stimulus-driven grooming was controlled for. Matched-pair analysis supported both predictions. Males delivered fewer oral grooming episodes per hour than females in 85% of sexually dimorphic species (n = 40), but only 56% of monomorphic species (n = 11) exhibited sexually dimorphic grooming, which was not different from random. Juvenile oral episodes per hour exceeded that of adult females in 74% of surveyed species (n = 36). As predicted by the body size principle, the grooming rate of juveniles declined as juveniles grew larger and less vulnerable to tick infestation. In separate analyses of Bovidae and Cervidae to control for common ancestry, both families supported sexually dimorphic grooming, but developmentally dimorphic grooming was supported only for Bovidae. Our results indicate that sexually dimorphic grooming is widespread in the ungulate species surveyed, suggesting that programmed grooming evolved at least as early as the common ancestor to the Artiodactyla."
"BARBOSA, A",FORAGING STRATEGIES AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON SCANNING AND FLOCKING BEHAVIOR OF WADERS,JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY,26,182,186,10.2307/3677317,1995,"Scanning and flocking behaviour of 16 species of wader showing three different foraging strategies (pause-travel, visual continuous, tactile continuous) was studied to test predictions regarding the effect of foraging technique on such behaviours. The scanning hypothesis predicts that (I) pause-travel foraging species will spend less time vigilant and will scan less frequently than species using a continuous foraging strategy (either visual or tactile); the flocking hypothesis predicts that (2) visually hunting species (both pause-travel and visual continuous) will tend to form smaller flocks than tactile-foraging species. The results show differences between pause-travel and continuous foraging species in vigilance rate but not in time spent vigilant or in mean scan duration. The two continuous strategies did not differ in any variable related to scanning behaviour. However, with respect to flocking behaviour, both pause-travel and visual continuous-foraging species differed from tactile continuous-foraging species in foraging flock size. These results are discussed in the light of the syndrome hypothesis."

However, little analysis is available to suggest how social welfare would be affected by consumer and industry responses to these new vaccines. To address this void, we use stated-preference data to estimate consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for food safety vaccines and then simulate the welfare impacts of subsidizing consumer purchases of the vaccine given two different industry responses: maintaining current levels of food safety vigilance and reducing food safety vigilance due to a moral hazard response that undermines consumer confidence in food safety. To obtain consumer preferences for the vaccine, we simultaneously estimate a three-equation model that recognizes the recursive nature of responses to questions probing respondents' willingness to purchase vaccines and perceptions of the probability and severity of possible foodborne illness incidents and the joint distribution of unobservable components. Our simulations show large consumer WTP if vaccines are relatively inexpensive while the presence of moral hazard increases respondents' willingness to pay and voluntary uptake of vaccine.

Many species use acoustic signals to communicate about the presence of predators, and some of them use non-vocal sounds. Here, we evaluated the role of the non-vocal sound produced by scaled doves (Columbina squammata) during escape takeoffs. Initially, we investigated the context of the non-vocal sound production to access the effects of natural threats on individuals' escape response. Then, we used simulated attacks (a direct running movement toward the focal individuals) to confirm the preliminary observations and to evaluate how position in the group affects escape response and vigilance. For both the observational and experimental parts, we registered, among other variables, the occurrence of takeoff flight, if it was followed by a production of non-vocal sound, the position of the individuals within the flock and their response (e.g., stay, flew, vigilance). We observed that both solitary and flocked individuals produce non-vocal sounds during takeoff flights, although it was more commonly registered for flocks. The production of the non-vocal sound elicited a faster escape response on flock members, and individuals at the center of the flock showed a higher probability to takeoff. The results suggest that the non-vocal sound may signal information about predation risk and that it may be directed both to conspecifics and to the predator itself. Our results therefore contribute to the understanding of the evolution of mechanical sound production in birds and shed some light on its function as a communication signal, especially under a predation context."

Mate retention tactics range from vigilance to violence, and are linked to variables such as marital satisfaction and relationship aggression. The Mate Retention Inventory (MRI, 104 items comprising 19 tactics) has proven to be reliable and valid. Given the importance of assessing mate retention in various contexts, there is a need for a briefer version of the MRI. In Study 1 (N = 1032), we develop a short form of the MRI (the MRI-SF), which assesses performance of 19 mate retention tactics using two items per tactic. The tactic scales show internal consistency, high correlations with the MRI long-form tactic scales, and links with assessments of controlling behavior, relationship violence, and an assessment of injury. Study 2 (N = 625) replicates the MRI-SF reliability and high correlations with the MRI long-form tactic scales, and shows links to a sexual coercion measure. We conclude that the MRI-SF is sufficiently reliable and valid that it can be used in basic and applied research in place of the MRI long-form for most purposes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Sentinel-1A C-band interferograms show about a 7-cm line of sight movement caused by the M-S 6.4 Menyuan earthquake; meanwhile, several features indicative of ground movement were detected by the proposed method and demonstrated by the Gaofen-1 optical images; the interpretation of high-resolution optical data complemented the goal of better understanding the behavior of geo-hazard disasters. InSAR time series analysis provides an opportunity for continuous monitoring of geo-hazards in remote areas, while the optical image method is easily affected by decorrelation due to snowfall."

Whilst a number of different methodologies are currently in use, little is known about how arthropod predators respond to artificially manipulated sentinel prey in comparison with predation on free-living prey populations. We assessed how attack rates on immobilized (aphids stuck to cards) and artificial (plasticine lepidopteran larvae mimics) sentinel prey differed to predation on free-moving live prey (aphids). Predation was assessed in response to density of the common invertebrate predators, a foliar-active ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and a ground-active beetle Pterostichus madidus (Coleoptera: Carabidae). Significant increases in attack rates were found for the immobilized and artificial prey between the low and high predator density treatments. However, an increased predator density did not significantly reduce numbers of free-living live aphids included in the mesocosms in addition to the alternate prey. We also found no signs of predation on the artificial prey by the predator H. axyridis. These findings suggest that if our assessment of predation had been based solely on the foliar artificial prey, then no increase in predation would have been found in response to increased predator density. Our results demonstrate that predators differentially respond to sentinel prey items which could affect the level of predation recorded where target pest species are not being used."

Treatments were imposed for 1-day periods, with five replicates of each treatment (total of 10 study days). Instantaneous point sampling and continuous sampling were used to record penguin behaviour including proximity to visitor viewing area, surface swimming, diving, vigilance, visibility, resting and intra-group aggression during a total of 3 h on each of the 10 study days.

An important component of predicting how food shortages will affect animal populations is to measure the functional response, i.e. the relationship between food density and feeding rate, over the range of environmental conditions experienced by foraging animals. Crop stubble fields are an important foraging habitat for many species of seed-eating farmland bird. However, some important questions remain regarding farmland bird foraging behaviour in this habitat, and in particular the effect of stubble on farmland bird functional responses is unknown. We measured the functional responses of a seed-eating passerine, the Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, consuming seeds placed on the substrate surface in three different treatments: bare soil, low density stubble and high density stubble. Stubble presence significantly reduced feeding rates, but there was no significant difference between the two stubble treatments. Stubble reduced feeding rates by reducing the maximum attack distance, i.e. the distance over which an individual food item is targeted and consumed. The searching speed, handling time per seed, proportion of time spent vigilant, duration of vigilance bouts and duration of head-down search periods were unaffected by the presence of stubble. The frequency of vigilance bouts was higher in the bare soil treatment, but this is likely to be a consequence of the increased feeding rate. We show the influence of a key habitat type on the functional response of a seed-eating passerine, and discuss the consequences of this for farmland bird conservation."

One strategy employed by carnivores to minimize potentially costly interspecific competition is avoidance of dominant species. Recent research has highlighted the importance of consistent individual differences in behavior (i.e. temperament traits) in understanding behavioral variation during predator-prey interactions and intraspecific interactions. However, the importance of such individual differences to interspecific competition has received little attention. Here, we examined the responses of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) to their primary competitors, African lions (Panthera leo), to (1) determine whether hyenas avoid lions and (2) evaluate the potential importance of individual differences in behavior during interspecific competition. Spotted hyenas and lions co-occur throughout much of Africa and are vigorous competitors. Whereas lions sometimes kill hyenas and steal their food, lions also represent a source of food for hyenas via scavenging. Using audio playback experiments, we found that hyenas do not uniformly avoid potential encounters with lions. Indeed, we noted considerable variation among individuals in their responses to lion roars, and this variation reflected consistent individual differences in risk-taking and vigilance tendencies. Individual differences in vigilance behavior were specific to interactions with lions. We conclude that individual differences in behavior have the potential to play an important role in determining the nature and outcome of interspecific competition."

Peter",Working the crowd: sociable vervets benefit by reducing exposure to risk,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,27,988,994,10.1093/beheco/arw003,2016,"Reduction of predation risk represents the most likely explanation for the evolution of group-living among the anthropoid primates. Obligate sociality leads to increased competition for resources, meaning that animals may face a trade-off between safe positions within the troop and increased foraging efficiency. Dominance has been proposed to be a major factor influencing spatial position within primate troops, but it is also possible that animals can improve their spatial position using social strategies, such as grooming. In many species, dominance rank and social preference (as expressed through grooming) are confounded. In our study population of vervet monkeys, however, dominance does not underpin social preference, enabling us to test whether 1) more sociable vervets experience reduced exposure to predation risk, as indexed by vigilance, and 2) that dominant animals accepted increased risk in order to forage at the front of the troop. We collected spatially explicit data on the individual locations of members of 2 troops at predetermined times over a 4-month period. We constructed bounded Voronoi tessellations for each temporal snapshot, with the area of each animal's tile identifying its domain of danger. We also collected data on time spent vigilant and foraging, dominance rank, and grooming behavior. We found no effect of dominance, but animals with larger grooming networks were less exposed to predation risk, from which they benefitted through both reduced vigilance and increased foraging time. We interpret these results in the light of current debates about the ways in which sociality affects fitness."

Research shows, independently, both types of cues can influence anti-predator and foraging behaviours in prey species. However, since animals naturally encounter indirect and direct cues simultaneously, we were interested in quantifying their cumulative effect. Our aim was to evaluate food intake and behaviours (patch use, feeding (rate and time), vigilance) of a nocturnal mammalian herbivore to indirect (open vs. covered microhabitats; illumination) and direct (fox/owl odours) predator cues. We ran a preference trial with four paired treatments using a covered Safe food patch and an open Risk food patch, with one of four combinations of indirect and direct predator cues. Predation risk had a significant effect on both intake and behaviour (including feeding time, rate, and vigilance), but these effects differed depending on cues. No two combinations of cues produced exactly the same effects, illustrating the complexity of interactions that occur between cues. Covered patches were always perceived as less risky than open patches, but unexpectedly, open patches were perceived as riskier when dark rather than light. The strongest suite of (negative) responses to risk was associated with combined indirect and direct cues. These results highlight the importance of considering jointly, intake from a patch, intake rate, and behaviours, such as the proportion of time spent vigilant, when quantifying predation risk, rather than intake alone."

The calf joined a local herd of elk, and its radio signal revealed that the elk, in two months' time, travelled eight times back and forth between the herd's traditional semi-open winter range at Devona and a largely wooded area at Rocky River > 3 km away. Each time, on their trans-valley route the elk crossed a busy highway, a railway, and a partly frozen river. Sightings of elk and Wolves (Canis lupus) were inversely correlated on 97 days of observation at Devona. We conclude that the elk's migrations were prompted by their urge to avoid and flee from Wolves, which were common at both locations."

Selection should favor animals that make good trade-offs between sleep attributes (e.g., location, timing, duration) and predation risk, in other words, sleep should be facultative. The few studies that document sleep plasticity in response to predation risk have focused on endothermic vertebrates. We tested the hypothesis that a representative ectothermic vertebrate, the Desert Iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis), exhibits behavioral sleep plasticity in response to predation risk. We found a reduction (> 50%) in total sleep time during daylight when Desert Iguanas were exposed continuously to a Sidewinder (Crotalus cerastes) in a laboratory setting. During asynchronous eye closure (ASEC) bouts, the eye of the iguana distant to the Sidewinder was more often closed, whereas the proximal eye was more often open, suggesting unihemispheric sleep (which has not been confirmed yet in reptiles) to maintain vigilance. Desert Iguanas spent more time aboveground and less time within their burrows when the Sidewinder was present. Snake activity was minimal, with movements occurring just 1.1% of the time, suggesting that iguanas were not merely responding to a moving object. Our findings suggest that Desert Iguanas will forgo sleep and remain vigilant when the potential for predation is increased. These findings illustrate the importance of ecology in shaping the behavior and probably the associated physiological and neurological attributes of sleep in ectothermic vertebrates."

The present research was conducted to measure Benzo a pyrene (BaP) concentration in different tissues of Rock Dove Columba livia as a sentinel species in in vitro and in vivo conditions. For this purpose, five groups were exposed to different concentrations (0.1, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 mg. kg-1 bw) of BaP. Also, for the comparison of in vitro results with urban conditions, 12 body samples were captured from the Tehran megacity. Results showed different accumulation patterns among the studied groups, which can be due to different intake pathways of pollutants by these birds. According to the results, in case of bioaccumulation factor, the rapid biotransformation rate of BaP in tissues of pigeons might affect their amount. Overall, the fat tissue at first and after that, the muscle tissue of C. livia could serve as a suitable biomonitor for BaP in the Tehran megacity."

The pre-laying period is unusually long for a goose species nesting at high latitudes (73-degrees-N). Geese arrived at Bylot Island around 27 May but the peak initiation of egg-laying was around 12-14 June. During pre-laying, paired females fed for 75% and were alert for 6% of the 24-hr day, whereas males fed for 44% and were alert for 33% of the day. In one year that laying geese were observed, females fed less than during pre-laying and time spent at the nest increased. Time budget was not related to time of day or number of days before egg-laying. Although male vigilance apparently enabled females to devote more time to feeding, male alert behavior was poorly synchronized with female feeding. Pair copulations were recorded frequently (0.23/hr) and 2 extra-pair copulations were observed. Males were involved more often than females in aggressive interactions (2.55 vs. 0.36 aggressions bird-1 hr-1) and often attacked neighboring pairs. The proportion of pairs with yearlings was low (6.3%) and parents frequently attacked their young (1.53 bird-1 hr-1). However, presence of yearlings did not influence time budget of pairs. The long pre-laying delay and the intense feeding activity of females suggest that, in addition to energy reserves accumulated during the spring migration, food intake on the nesting ground may also be an important source of energy for laying Greater Snow Geese."

We investigated antipredator responses (predator detection probabilities and vigilance behavior) in 2 species with different visual properties (European starlings, Sturus vulgaris, have higher acuity and wider blind areas at the rear of their heads than house sparrows, Passer domesticus) in relation to distance to the predator, body posture, and head orientation. Visual acuity may affect the distance at which a predator is detected; while the size of the blind area may influence the body postures and head orientation with the highest predator detection probabilities. Distance to the decreased predator detection probabilities of house sparrows (lower acuity) but not those of European starlings. Certain body postures and head orientations, influenced both species despite the interspecific differences in visual field configuration. Times allocated to scanning were similar, but European starlings had longer head-up scan bouts likely to enhance scanning coverage, whereas house sparrows had higher head-up scan rates probably to reduce the length of interscan intervals. We discuss alternative interpretations; however, our findings suggest that sensory configurations may limit the effectiveness of some antipredator strategies under certain ecological conditions, which has implications for understanding the evolution of different behavioral mechanisms that reduce predation risk."
"Rieucau, Guillaume; Giraldeau, Luc-Alain",Group size effect caused by food competition in nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata),BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,20,421,425,10.1093/beheco/arn144,2009,"When foraging group sizes increase, animals generally decrease the time devoted to antipredator detection and increase their foraging rate, the commonly reported group size effect. The increased foraging rate is thought to follow from increased safety from predators because as group size increases, more eyes are available to detect predators and the risk of being a predator's victim is diluted. This increased safety then allows higher feeding rates because individuals can reallocate time spent in vigilance to foraging. However, increased foraging rates can also be due to increased competition for resources as the number of companions increases. We tested whether increased feeding rates are the product of competition or antipredation when group size increases in nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata). We used edited video playbacks to change group size and type of competitor: vigilant only, feeding only, and controls. We found that the increased feeding rate associated with an increased group size only resulted when the companions were feeding. Video playbacks of nonforaging companions neither decreased an individual's use of vigilance while handling food nor did it release the full increase of feeding rate. Focal birds lowered their scanning time while feeding as the frequency of pecking by simulated nonvigilant companions increased. We conclude that the group size effect reported in nutmeg mannikins is not a product of safety benefits of group living but may also arise from the costs imposed by competition for resources."

We measured flock size, density, peck rate, foraging time, vigilance, aggression, and invertebrate abundance in five habitats. Seven sites contained shore-grazed grass, short-ungrazed grass, tall-grazed grass, tall-ungrazed grass, and feedlot habitat treatments. Cowbird flock sizes were largest in short-grazed grass, but densities were highest in feedlots. Foraging time and aggression did not differ among habitats, but peck rates were highest in feedlots, and vigilance at foraging sites was highest in short-grass habitats. Females spent more time foraging than males, but peck rates did not vary significantly with sex. Males spent more time in vigilant and aggressive behaviors than did females. Invertebrate biomass and density were lowest in feedlots. Large flock sizes and high peck rates coincided with high invertebrate densities in short-grazed grass. Cowbird flock size was positively related to invertebrate density, but foraging time and peck rate were not related to invertebrate density. We conclude that cattle were an important component of the habitat that influenced cowbird foraging behavior. Cowbirds selected feedlots because of readily available grain and selected short-grazed grass because of the availability of invertebrate foods. Compared with grazing, grass height was of secondary importance to foraging cowbirds."

An individual's perception of predation risk may depend on many factors, such as distance to refuge and group size, but it is Unclear whether individuals respond to different factors ill a similar manner. We tested whether flocks of foraging starlings responded in the same way to an increased perception of predation risk by assessing three factors: (1) neighbor distances, (2) habitat obstruction, and (3) recent exposure to a predator. We found that in all three scenarios of increased risk, starlings reduced their interscan intervals (food-searching bouts), which increased the frequency of their vigilance periods. We then examined how one of these factors, habitat obstruction, affected escape speed by simulating an attack with a model predator. Starlings were slower to respond in visually Obstructed habitats (long grass swards) and slower when the), had their head down in obstructed habitats than when they had their head down in open habitats. In addition, reaction times were quicker when starlings could employ their peripheral fields of vision. Our results demonstrate that. different Sources of increased risk call generate similar behavioral responses within a species. The degree of Visibility in the physical and social environment affects both the actual and perceived risk of predation."
Sun Li-Xing,Anti-predation does not fully explain grouping in the Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis).,Acta Zoologica Sinica,48,302,308,,2002,"The grouping behavior of the Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis) was studied at Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve, Jiangxi, China. I made three predictions to test the hypothesis that grouping is an anti-predatory strategy: (1) group size is negatively related to vegetation cover, (2) animals in groups have more time to feed than solitary animals, and (3) animals spend less time in vigilance when they are in groups than when they are alone. Results showed that group size was largest in the mating season and smallest in the parturition season. Deer tended to form larger groups when they were in short grass areas than in tall grass areas. Hence, the first prediction is supported. However, solitary deer and deer in groups did not differ in time allocated to feeding or vigilance. Therefore, predictions 2 and 3 are not supported. Time budget analysis revealed that females with young allocated less time to feeding, but more time to walking during the non-mating season. During the mating season, females grouped with males spent less time feeding than solitary females, and solitary males spent more time looking for females than did males grouped with females during the mating season. In light of the complications found in the grouping behavior of the water deer, the anti-predatory hypothesis seems to be insufficient as the only reason for the deer to group. Other socio-ecological factors are also important in determining the grouping behavior of this species."

In summer, swimming and paddling (adults and cubs) and diving (adults) were recorded significantly more frequently than in winter, correlated with significantly higher frequencies of use of the water features. For the cubs, the relative frequency of diving was significantly lower compared to winter, as the cubs were still learning to swim and forage underwater. The levels of activity and the diversity of behaviours were higher around feeding times in both seasons. The cubs were already swimming in shallow water at 3.5 months-old and in deeper water at 4.5 months-old, mostly as a family group. At 3.5-6 months-old they were out of sight in the den significantly more frequently than the adults and displayed more play-fighting. By 8-9.5 months-old they moved around independently, foraging or playing and their behavioural budget was similar to that of the adults. Object juggling and vigilance standing were displayed from around 4 months-old, when weaning also occurred. The introduction of additional structural enrichment (logs, holt, nest-box) in early autumn increased the frequency of use of ground areas in winter, when the water temperatures were below 10 [degree]C. The feeding and structural enrichment strategies used were effective for keeping the otters active outdoors and maintaining their high display value in the cold season (day time summer air temperatures 15-27 [degree]C > winter 3.5-10 [degree]C), emphasizing the importance of enrichment for good welfare."

The Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris) is a highly social facultative cooperative breeder from southern Africa that harasses several species of venomous snakes. We examined whether harassment was part of alloparental care by comparing harassment behaviours among different age and sex classes in Cape ground squirrel social groups. We also assessed how individuals adjusted their behaviour dependent on levels of risk by examining the Cape ground squirrel's harassment behaviour among non-venomous, and two species of venomous snakes. We found adult females with emerged juvenile offspring took the most risk, harassing for longer durations and at higher intensities than other group members, suggesting that snake harassment was a maternal behaviour. Females with juvenile offspring only harassed the highest risk elapid snake but increased vigilance and inspection with increasing snake risk suggesting that the Cape ground squirrel can discriminate between different types of snake predators."

It is expected that social species will possess a functionally and structurally complex vocal repertoire. While several studies on mammalian systems exist supporting this, evidence from avian systems is comparatively limited. Towards this, we present evidence for complex acoustic communication in a cooperatively breeding passerine, Jungle Babbler. Jungle Babblers were found to possess a diverse vocal repertoire comprising 15 call types produced in either affiliative or agonistic context. These calls mediated the coordination of various social behaviours including group movement, foraging, brood care, aggression and vigilance. Yet, 8 out of 15 vocalizations were produced in the context of vigilance. This disproportionate investment of vocalizations towards coordinated acoustic vigilance is characteristic of many cooperatively breeding birds. Discriminant function analysis based on acoustic features verifies the classification of calls based on behavioural contexts. We also find evidence for the prediction that functionally similar calls are likely to be structurally similar as well. Multisyllabic calls were found to be composed of acoustically distinct notes that occur in a defined order in most cases. This implies that there may be underlying rules that determine call composition to give rise to functional calls to which receivers respond. Our study demonstrates that Jungle Babblers possess a structurally and functionally complex vocal repertoire. It also lays the foundation for future investigations on combinatorial and syntactical rules underlying call function and structure in bird vocalizations. Significance statement Studies on vocal complexity in birds have focussed mainly on repertoire size, structure and function. However, acoustic features of elements that constitute a call/song are rarely examined to evaluate vocal complexity. We examined complex communication in a cooperatively breeding social passerine, Jungle Babbler, for which we assessed repertoire size, function, acoustic features of calls and their constituent elements. Jungle Babblers were found to possess a functionally diverse vocal repertoire comprising 15 call types, 53% of which were in the context of vigilance. Discriminant function analysis based on acoustic features upheld the context-based call classification, implying that the calls were both functionally and structurally distinct. We also found that several calls were composed of multiple, acoustically distinct notes. These findings will be foundational in understanding the interrelations between sociality and communicative complexity and underlying combinatorial rules that determine call structure and function."

However, this negative correlation may be explained additionally in terms of the 'dilution effect' and 'selfish herd geometry'. Our experimental investigation of the scanning behaviour of free-living spotted turtle doves foraging at different shaped feeders revealed that flock geometry influenced individual scanning rates. The time spent scanning declined with group size less rapidly among birds foraging in linear flocks than among those foraging in more two-dimensional flocks. These results were not confounded by aggressive behaviour, and indicate that the benefits of foraging in groups include the so-called selfish herd geometry."

We tested whether freezing behaviour (complete immobility in a previously foraging bird) observed in chaffinches before escaping from an approaching potential threat functions as a period of risk-assessment, and whether information on predator identity is gained even when time available is very short. We flew either a model of a sparrowhawk (predator) or a woodpigeon (no threat) at single chaffinches. Escape delays were significantly shorter with the hawk, except when a model first appeared close to the chaffinch. Chaffinches were significantly more vigilant when they resumed feeding after exposure to the sparrowhawk compared to the woodpigeon showing that they were able to distinguish between threats, and this applied even when time available for assessment was short (an average of 0.29 s). Our results show freezing in chaffinches functions as an effective economic risk assessment period, and that threat information is gained even when very short periods of time are available during an attack."

Thereafter, a continuous decline due to persistent persecution and habitat loss led the native population to extinction in 2002, long after the disappearance of the species as a breeder from the rest of continental Iberia. Reintroduction was the only remaining option to restore a breeding population and it was carried out in a vast inland reservoir in 2011[long dash]2015 with the collaboration of Finland and Sweden as donor countries. A total of 56 nestlings were translocated, of which 47 successfully dispersed. From 2016[long dash]2018, the follow-up of the project focused on improving nesting conditions through artificial platforms set up in favourable areas (reservoirs, estuarine marshlands, large rivers), especially those regularly used by over-summering ospreys. So far, 25 platforms of different types were set up. Portugal offers a wide range of favourable habitats for ospreys: large rivers and estuaries, sizable inland reservoirs, and a relatively well preserved rocky coast that can become naturally reoccupied, thereby restoring the species historical distribution. Natural wetlands and artificial reservoirs offer few and often precarious natural nest supports but this could be compensated by artificial platforms, which can hopefully foster the spreading out of the founder population. Altogether, there are good perspectives for a self-sustaining breeding population of ospreys in southern coastal and inland Portugal in the future, provided that sustainable monitoring and vigilance, and management of human disturbance are assured. At the same time, further improvement of nesting conditions with platforms wherever necessary should closely follow the expansion of the population."

Badgers were observed seven times in a marmot colony and extensive digging at marmot burrows was recorded five times in 40 y. When four badgers occupied a burrow at the edge of a marmot colony, the behavior of marmots and badgers was observed for 7 d and the marmots for an additional 6 d after the badgers departed. Badgers hunted at a significantly higher rate in the afternoon than in the morning. The adult female usually hunted alone, failed to capture any adult marmots, but did kill young marmots. When badgers were present, marmots had more frequent alarm calls, lower rates of foraging and higher rates of vigilance than when badgers were absent. I estimated that badgers killed 67 of 1423 individual marmots. The risk of being killed by a badger was highest for young, intermediate for yearlings and lowest for adults. Badgers probably have little impact on marmot demography except for localized, short-term increases in mortality, but may significantly affect the fitness of individual marmots."

However, 'true' individual recognition, between adult group members, has never been demonstrated in a cooperatively breeding bird or mammal species. We tested whether a wild cooperative mammal, the dwarf mongoose, Helogale parvula, could recognize individual group members from their vocalizations. We provided test subjects with a large, desirable food item and then simulated the approach of another group member using playbacks of its contact calls. Mongooses were more vigilant after hearing the calls of individuals of higher rank than themselves (that could steal their food) compared with individuals of lower rank than themselves (that could not). We showed that the mongooses were not simply responding to age-related cues that conveyed potential information on rank, and provide some evidence that they were associating the unique characteristics of the call with an individually specific characteristic of the caller (i.e. its relative rank). We conclude that dwarf mongooses exhibit 'true' individual recognition, and this finding supports the potential validity of mechanisms that rely on individuals monitoring the behaviour of others to explain the evolution of cooperative behaviour.

I tested whether time budget and habitat use in adult wintering Common Cranes (Grus grus) in dehesas (pastoral woodland) of western Spain were affected by the presence of juveniles. Juvenile cranes devote less time to vigilance and spend more time feeding than adults in dehesas. Likewise, juveniles are involved in fewer aggressive encounters than adult cranes. Contrary to expectation, adults accompanied by juveniles devoted the same amount of time to vigilance and feeding and had the same intake rate than adults without juveniles in attendance. However, adult cranes with offspring in attendance were involved in more aggressive encounters than adults without juveniles in attendance when both adult groups were involved in large flocks. In contrast, when adults accompanied by juveniles were in small flocks they were involved in fewer aggressive encounters than adults without juveniles. I also detected a differential use of dehesas by adult cranes that was linked to juvenile presence and explained by the vulnerability of juvenile cranes in intraspecific social relationships. Adults with juveniles in attendance preferred dehesas with livestock where flock sizes were smaller than those in dehesas without livestock, and therefore where they might reduce the number of aggressive encounters with other cranes."

We investigated the response of Diana monkeys to increased predation risk by looking at behavioural changes associated with male long-distance calls, which are reliably given to certain predators. After male long-distance calls, group spread and nearest-neighbour distance decreased whilst travel and association rates for the group increased. The average height and exposure level of individuals in the group did not change after calls. Individual Diana monkeys changed their behaviour and were more likely to be vigilant or travel and less likely to engage in social or resting behaviours after long-distance calls. In addition, movement rates increased with the number of species the Diana monkeys were associated with. Diana monkey long-distance calls facilitate the joining of groups of other species. Black and white colobus and lesser spot-nosed monkeys were more likely to be in an association following a long-distance call than before. Behavioural responses, such as increased travel or association rates, that reduce foraging efficiency are interpreted as evidence of a non-lethal impact of increased predation risk."

Mated birds associated closely within the flock Females spent more time feeding than did their mates, while male geese were more vigilant and more frequently involved in aggressive encounters. Increased aggression by males and females at the centre of the flock could be a consequence of the shorter distances between birds at the middle.Male vigilance was higher at the edge. Male vigilance may protect the mate from potential predators (particularly at the edge of the flock) and possibly from interference by conspecifics. Protection enables females to decrease the time they spend vigilant, and thus increase the time spent feeding, allowing them to gain the reserves of fat and protein needed for successful breeding."

The first goal of this article is to justify the potential utility of a transdiagnostic perspective for theory, research and treatment using empirical evidence and clinical vignettes. We then take as an example one set of cognitive processes-attentional processes-to illustrate the approach. Evidence for three attentional processes is provided: vigilance to external concern-related stimuli; vigilance to internal concern-related stimuli (self-focused attention) and attentional avoidance. It is concluded that each of these attentional processes are transdiagnostic. We then discuss three possible resolutions to the question: How can a transdiagnostic perspective be valid when the different psychological disorders present so differently? The three proposals are: (1) variations in idiosyncratic current concerns; (2) variations in the degree of shared processes and (3) distinct processes for specific disorders or groups of disorders. The role of a transdiagnostic approach in supporting the development and testing of theories of psychopathology is highlighted and the need for future studies that incorporate multiple patient groups is discussed."

Existing glacial lake inventories, chiefly created using Landsat satellite imagery, mainly relate to 1990 onwards and relatively long (decadal) temporal scales. Moreover, there is a lack of robust information on the expansion and the GLOF hazard status of glacial lakes in the Bhutan Himalaya. We mapped Bhutanese glacial lakes from the 1960s to 2020, and used these data to determine their distribution patterns, expansion behavior, and GLOF hazard status. 2,187 glacial lakes (corresponding to 130.19 +/- 2.09 km(2)) were mapped from high spatial resolution (1.82-7.62 m), Corona KH-4 images from the 1960s. Using the Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Sentinel-1 (20 m x 22 m), we mapped 2,553 (151.81 +/- 7.76 km(2)), 2,566 (152.64 +/- 7.83 km(2)), 2,572 (153.94 +/- 7.83 km(2)), 2,569 (153.97 +/- 7.79 km(2)) and 2,574 (156.63 +/- 7.95 km(2)) glacial lakes in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The glacier-fed lakes were mainly present in the Phochu (22.63%) and the Kurichu (20.66%) basins. A total of 157 glacier-fed lakes have changed into non-glacier-fed lakes over the 60 years of lake evolution. Glacier-connected lakes (which constitutes 42.25% of the total glacier-fed lake) area growth accounted for 75.4% of the total expansion, reaffirming the dominant role of glacier-melt water in expanding glacial lakes. Between 2016 and 2020, 19 (4.82 km(2)) new glacial lakes were formed with an average annual expansion rate of 0.96 km(2) per year. We identified 31 lakes with a very-high and 34 with high GLOF hazard levels. These very-high to high GLOF hazard lakes were primarily located in the Phochu, Kurichu, Drangmechu, and Mochu basins. We concluded that the increasing glacier melt is the main driver of glacial lake expansion. Our results imply that extending glacial lakes studies back to the 1960s provides new insights on glacial lake evolution from glacier-fed lakes to non-glacier-fed lakes. Additionally, we reaffirmed the capacity of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to determine annual glacial lake changes. The results from this study can be a valuable basis for future glacial lake monitoring and prioritizing limited resources for GLOF mitigation programs."
"Getschow, Cynthia M.; Rivers, Pearl; Sterman, Samantha; Lumpkin, David C.; Tarvin, Keith A.",Does Gray Squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) Response to Heterospecific Alarm Calls Depend on Familiarity or Acoustic Similarity?,ETHOLOGY,119,983,992,10.1111/eth.12145,2013,"In habitats in which multiple species are prey to the same predators, individuals can greatly benefit from recognizing information regarding predators that is provided by other species. Past studies have demonstrated that various mammals respond to familiar heterospecific alarm calls, but whether acoustic similarity to a familiar call can prompt a mammal's recognition of an unfamiliar call has yet to be shown. We presented alarm calls to free-ranging eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) and recorded behavioral changes in vigilance and antipredatory response. Playbacks included alarm calls of a sympatric bird (American robin, Turdus migratorius), an allopatric bird with a call structure similar to that of the robin (common blackbird, Turdus merula), and an allopatric bird with a distinct call structure (New Holland honeyeater, Phylidonyris novaehollandiae). Squirrels responded significantly more frequently to squirrel alarm calls (positive control) than to robin song (negative control) or honeyeater calls. Squirrel response to robin and blackbird alarm calls was statistically similar to their response to squirrel alarm calls, indicating that squirrels responded to those alarm calls as if they provided information about the presence of predators. However, squirrel response to robin song was not statistically different from response to any of the other avian calls, including the robin and blackbird alarms, suggesting that squirrels neither respond to blackbird alarms as if they clearly signify danger, nor as if they clearly do not signify danger, perhaps reflecting some ambiguity in interpretation of the calls. These results suggest that squirrel responses to alarm calls are generally based on call familiarity, but that acoustic similarity of an unfamiliar allopatric call to a familiar call also can elicit antipredator behavior. The lack of response to honeyeater alarm calls also supports the hypothesis that call recognition by gray squirrels is dependent on familiarity, rather than simply detection of an acoustic feature common to alarm calls across a variety of avian species."

To determine whether common or differing decisional styles were associated with alcohol and gambling problems university students (n = 462) completed online the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, and the South Oaks Gambling Screen to assess their alcohol use, and gambling patterns. There was some comorbidity between those at risk for alcohol and gambling-related problems, with both groups frequenting more gaming venues, however, participants at risk for alcohol related problems differed in their decisional styles from those at risk for gambling problems. A greater risk of alcohol related problems was linked to lower vigilance scores and increased tendencies towards procrastination. A higher risk of gambling problems was associated with lower decisional self-esteem and an increased proneness to hypervigilance or panic. Therefore, while a predisposition towards addiction manifests as a preference for addictive behaviour, it is associated with different decisional styles. Problem drinkers are more likely to have an avoidant decisional style, while problem gamblers are not confident in their ability to make decisions, and their decisions feel pressured.

In riparian areas, tourists can conveniently reach primates via motor boats, but no study has directly examined whether such boats cause stress in primates. Our goal was to test whether the approach of a motor boat induces stress-related and other behaviors in proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus), an Endangered species. We studied six one-male, multifemale groups living in a remote riparian area in Sabah, Malaysia, and conducted an experiment by approaching the monkeys in a motor boat by using three conditions with different speeds and travel distances (fast-close, slow-close, and slow-far conditions; 7-8 subjects per condition). For each condition, we compared stress-related behaviors before the boat approach with after the boat started approaching. Feeding, allogrooming and aggression were similarly examined, respectively. We also observed the monkeys' behaviors at other times to examine age-sex classes differences in vigilance, social proximity, allogrooming, aggression and play (87 subjects). In the experiment, subjects displayed stress-related behaviors for longer in the fast-close and slow-close conditions once the boat started approaching than before the boat approach. The subjects also reduced feeding in the fast-close condition after the boat started approaching. In our observational study, males were more vigilant than females-a behavior that is likely to relate to male-male competition and group protection. This study provides evidence that even a single motor boat moving slowly, with humans behaving calmly, may negatively affect primate behavior and induce stress-an impact that is likely to be larger with tourist boats. Our study also shows that using conditions comparable to the slow-far condition (speed of 3.6 km/hr; no closer than 60 m), where no impact was observed, may help with to develop guidelines for primate tourism in riparian areas. Future research that examines the impact of boats on other primates is needed."

Therefore, 24 hours trapping was conducted at the urban Sungai Dua and sub-urban Batu Maung residence area, Penang, Malaysia, using two different traps; BG-Sentinel Trap and CDC Fay-Prince Light Trap under two different light conditions to investigate the possibility effect of light to both mosquito species. CDC Fay-Prince light trap was effective in trapping Cx. quinquefasciatus than BG-Sentinel traps. The results indicated that both traps were ineffective to capture Ae. albopictus. In this study, the peak activity of Ae. albopictus was not following the diel host-seeking activity which this species active at daylight (6:00am-8:00am) and during night time (6:00pm-8:00pm). Whereas, Cx. quinquefasctus was captured mostly during the nocturnal time (12:00am-6:00am) with a greater number of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes captured under no light conditions. Meteorological parameter recorded within experiment such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed did not correlate with the abundance of both mosquito species (p> 0.05). However, light intensity parameters significantly affected Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquito abundance in both residential areas (p= 0.002), but not the Ae. albopictus mosquitoes (p= 0.086 Sungai Dua; p= 0.803 Batu Maung) as light is not a primary cue attraction factor to any host source towards this species. Ovitraps seem to be better tools for collecting and surveillance population of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes as compared to BG-Sentinel trap (Paired t-test; p= 0.019) and CDC Fay-Prince light trap (Paired t-test; p= 0.025). As a conclusion, BG-Sentinel trap and CDC Fay-Prince light traps is a not suitable tool for monitoring the activities of Ae. albopictus in the residential area, but CDC Fay-Prince light traps still found effective to use to capture Cx. quinquefasciatus. This study has therefore established immature sampling as the most effective method of capturing Ae. albopictus in a residential area."

A comparative analysis and review,ETHOLOGY,128,1,14,10.1111/eth.13233,2022,"In species in which adults of the two sexes show long-term association, males often engage in acts of assistance (services) aimed at females and/or their young in various behavioural contexts that are not reciprocated. We conducted a quantitative review of the primate literature on sex differences in involvement in protection against predation. We found that males were more likely to be at the front of group progressions, especially in contexts of increased risk, were more vigilant, sometimes to the point of becoming sentinels, were more active in mobbing, and were far more likely to counter-attack felids and monkey-eating raptors than females did. Our evaluation showed that these services may be an expression of male parental care or aimed at bonded partners, but we also encountered many cases in which non-sires, unrelated to either females or immatures, provide them. We hence investigate explanations invoking group augmentation or costly signalling. Currently, available data on male anti-predation services in nonhuman primates do not allow us to distinguish among them, although costly signalling better explains data on birds and humans. We develop predictions that will allow more detailed tests of the various hypotheses for this understudied phenomenon."

Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data for the period from October-2018 to March-2019 was analysed in this study. The major objective of this study was to generate crop growth profiles of different crops and identify the relationships between crop phenology and crop growth stages by generating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profiles of wheat and mustard crops.The results of spectral behavior of wheat (normal & late sown) and mustard during active growth stages indicated that these winter crops have distinct spectral signatures in Sentinel-2 spectral bands. The NDVI growth profiles of wheat and mustard indicate the temporal variations during different growth stages of these crops. The maximum temporal variations were observed during early growth stages to flowering & grain filling stages. The difference in sowing dates of wheat and mustard crops result in different phenological stages of these winter crops. The NDVI curve of Rabi Season-2018-19 was divided into different phenological growth phases namely, i) Phase-I: G(0) (Spectral emergence) to G(1)(Flag leaf emergence), Phase-II: G(1) (Flag leaf emergence) to G(max) (Flowering and Grain filling), Phase-III: G(max) (Flowering and Grain filling) to G(2) (Dough Stage) and Phase-IV: G(2) (Dough Stage) to G(3) (Physiological Maturity). The temporal changes in the NDVI was analysed by computing the Temporal Normalized Phenology Index (TNPI) between different phenological phases from G(0) to G(3).Mean TNPI values of wheat crop for different phenological phases were computed which indicated that rising part of NDVI profile of growth phases from G(0) to G(max) higher TNPI values whereas the declining part of NDVI profile of growth phases from G(max) to G(3) showed lower TNPI values. The difference NDVI images were generated using the NDVI images of two different phenological phases of wheat crop which represent the temporal changes in wheat crop greenness, where 0 represents no temporal change and 1 represents the maximum temporal change in vegetation greenness across wheat crop areas in the study area."
"Blumstein, Daniel T.; Ferando, Eleonora; Stankowich, Theodore",A test of the multipredator hypothesis: yellow-bellied marmots respond fearfully to the sight of novel and extinct predators,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,78,873,878,10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.07.010,2009,"Should prey retain an ability to respond to the sight of their extinct predators? The multipredator hypothesis (Blumstein 2006, Ethology, 112, 209-217) assumes that antipredator adaptations evolve together and thus prey may respond to extinct predators as long as they have experience with other predators. We tested this prediction in yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, a species with both extant and extinct predators. Marmots were baited to a predetermined location and then shown one of five life-size photographic stimuli: a medium-size sub-Saharan antelope, the gray duiker, Silvicapra grimmia, as a control stimulus; a red fox, Vulpes vulpes, a low-risk predator; a coyote, Canis latrans, a higher risk predator; a mountain lion, Felis concolor, an extant predator, but one with which our population had no ontogenetic experience; and a wolf, Canis lupus, an extinct predator. Marmots responded differently to each stimulus: they stopped foraging after seeing the duiker, engaged in low vigilance after seeing the fox, seemed to monitor the coyote, fled the wolf, and engaged in high vigilance (and on one occasion alarm-called) in response to the mountain lion. This pattern of responses was consistent with the different risks associated with each species: foxes required monitoring but marmots could generally escape them, coyotes routinely kill adult marmots, solitary hunting mountain lions might be dissuaded from attack once detected, and socially hunting wolves were a very high risk predator, which would be best hidden from. The pattern of responses was not explained simply by stimulus size, stimulus detectability, or stimulus similarity. These results are consistent with the multipredator hypothesis: visual predator discrimination for ontogenetically and evolutionarily novel predators may be maintained in yellow-bellied marmots by extant predation risk.

"Blumstein, Daniel T.; Fuong, Holly; Palmer, Elizabeth",Social security: social relationship strength and connectedness influence how marmots respond to alarm calls.,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,71,145,145,,2017,"Individuals vary in the number and types of social relationships they maintain. If beneficial, social relationships may reduce predation risk and thus increase an individual's sense of security. We tested this hypothesis by studying the responses of female yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) to broadcast alarm calls from unfamiliar individuals. First, we quantified affiliative interactions of animals in the field to calculate a set of social network measures. Because attributes of sociality are often correlated, we used principal component analysis to reduce our social network metrics to two unrelated factors and used the social network measure that accounted for the most variance for each principal component in further analyses. We then quantified the change in time allocated to vigilance and foraging following alarm call playback from baseline levels to the first 30 s and the second 30 s period (i.e., 31-60 s) following playback. We expected that if marmots with strong affiliative relationships felt more secure, they would forage more and allocate less time to vigilance after their immediate vigilance response to the broadcast alarm calls. Using mixed effects models that controlled for variation explained by a number of biologically important covariates and permutation tests to test the significance of social network variables, we found that marmots with a higher incloseness allocated significantly more time to vigilance in both the first and second 30 s after hearing a novel alarm call. Additionally, and while not significant (the observed parameter estimate fell between the 90 and 95% CI), marmots with a higher outstrength increased foraging in the second 30 s after hearing a novel alarmcall. If we assume that time allocated to foraging is a measure of security, then marmots with strong affiliative relationships reacted more to an alarm call from a novel individual and seemingly felt more secure than their counterparts. Our results, therefore, suggest that strong social relationships increase perceptions of security and illustrate an effect of social relationships on predation risk assessment. Significance statement In many species, including humans, there are benefits from maintaining good social relationships. These benefits include better health and greater longevity. We studied yellow-bellied marmots, a ground-dwelling squirrel that is notable because it has variable social relationships. Capitalizing on this social variation, we found that marmots that maintain strong affiliative relationships with other marmots may indeed forage more after hearing an artificially broadcast alarm call than marmots with weaker affiliative relationships. This result suggests that marmots that are more socially connected with others in their group may feel relatively more secure, possibly because they have others that can help them assess risk, and that a benefit of maintaining strong friendly social ties is that it permits animals to forage more. Thus, we suggest a new way that social relationships can be beneficial: they increase perceptions of security and this ultimatelymay facilitate foraging."

We hypothesized that in response to large carnivore scent red deer would increase their vigilance, although reducing the frequency and duration of visits to foraging sites. Consequently, browsing intensity on tree saplings was expected to decrease, whereas a higher proportion of more preferred species was expected to be browsed to compensate for higher foraging costs. We expected stronger responses towards the ambush predator lynx, compared with the cursorial predator wolf. These hypotheses were tested in a cafeteria experiment conducted within three red deer enclosures, each containing four experimental plots with olfactory cues of wolf, lynx, cow, and water as control. On each plot, a camera trap was placed and browsing intensity was measured for one consecutive week, repeated three times. Red deer reduced their visitation duration and browsing intensity on plots with large carnivore scent. Despite red deer showing a clear preference for certain tree species, the presence of large carnivore scent did not change selectivity towards different tree species. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found more pronounced effects of wolf (cursorial) compared with lynx (ambush). This study is the first to experimentally assess the perceived risk effects on the red deer foraging behavior of large carnivores differing in hunting modes. Our findings provide insights into the role of olfactory cues in predator-prey interactions and how they can modify fine-scale herbivore-plant interactions."

In North America, feral horses occupy 31.6 million acres throughout western North America. Throughout their range, feral horses often share habitat with American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana). Since horses are larger and more aggressive than pronghorn, they are considered socially dominant. In the Great Basin of western North America, pronghorn often access water sources where horses occur since habitat preferences are similar. If pronghorn are excluded where water is used by both species, pronghorn fitness may be impaired, especially during dry or droughty periods. The purpose of this study was to investigate interference competition between pronghorn and feral horses at water sources within the Great Basin. We observed horses and pronghorn at high-use water sources and recorded all occurrences and outcomes of pronghorn/horse interactions. We assessed differences in pronghorn behavior in the presence or absence of horses. Pronghorn invested more time on vigilance behavior and less time foraging or drinking in the presence of horses than in their absence. Nearly half of pronghorn/horse interactions resulted in pronghorn exclusion from water. We conclude that as feral horse numbers increase, competition for water will subsequently increase.

The harsh environment imposes strong nutritional constraints which influence activity patterns and foraging strategies. In addition, the need to evade predators strongly determines the way in which prey behave (Lima and Dill 1990). The traditional view is that prey manage food acquisition and predation risk by trading one behavior at the expense of the other. However, if a range of anti-predator behaviors can collectively be adopted at appropriate temporal scales, then this trade-off may be somewhat reduced (Lind and Cresswell 2005). Plasticity in prey behaviors may balance the need to forage and minimize predation risk, thereby allowing prey to remain in an environment that both provides adequate forage resources but also poses a high threat of predation. We observed the behavior of elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Madison headwaters area of Yellowstone National Park during 15 consecutive winter field seasons, accruing approximately 3100 h of behavioral data before and after wolf (Canis lupus) reintroduction to Yellowstone, when elk were exposed to varying degrees of wolf predation risk. We hypothesized that environmental and temporal factors would play a fundamental role governing the likelihood of winter foraging by elk. We proposed competing hypotheses regarding the effect of wolves. Based on the traditional view of the foraging-vigilance trade-off, we suspected that the addition of wolves to the system would manifest a higher degree of behavioral alertness in elk and reduce the likelihood of foraging. Alternatively, increasing behavioral alertness when wolves were actively hunting at night would manifest increased diurnal foraging. Furthermore, we incorporated our knowledge of the range of other behavioral responses exhibited by elk to determine if they behaviorally compensated to mediate any fitness costs associated with behaviors that reduced predation risk."

Temporal trends in gillnet (small 3 1/4 inch mesh, large 5 1/2 inch mesh) and linetrawl unstandardized catch rates were similar for all gears, with the highest values at the beginning of each time-series, sharp declines after 1997, and oscillations around or below the series' mean catch rate thereafter. Mean catch rate for small mesh gillnets was consistently higher than that of large mesh gillnets for the entire time-series: peaking at 142 fish per net in 1996, and then averaging 11-36 fish/net; except for its lowest value of 6 fish/net in 2011. Large mesh gillnets yielded the lowest mean catch rate of all gears: declining from 49 fish/net in 1997 to less than 9 fish/net since 2000. Mean catch rate for linetrawls peaked at 223 fish per 1,000 hooks in 1996, and fluctuated around 100 fish/1,000 hooks until 2010 (except in 2006); prior to reaching its lowest value of 62 fish/1,000 hooks in 2014-2015. Sentinel catch rates for large mesh gillnet and linetrawl  control locations were standardized using Generalized Linear Models. Age-disaggregated standardized catch rates for recent year-classes were generally weaker than those in the past; although proportions-at-age of large mesh gillnet catch rates suggested that the 2008 year-class was relatively stronger. Age-aggregated catch rates were higher at the beginning of each time-series for both gears, declined over the mid-tolate 1990s, then remained at their lowest levels; decreasing below the series' mean of 6.4 fish/net (large mesh gillnets) in 1999, and 86 fish/1,000 hooks in 2009 (linetrawls). Gillnet and linetrawl catch rates for 2016 were 1.5 fish/net and 57.5 fish/1,000 hooks, respectively. Length frequencies of Atlantic Cod measured in Sentinel Surveys indicated that the small mesh gillnet was the least selective gear (retaining small and large fish from multiple year-classes), whereas large mesh gillnets and linetrawls captured larger fish in specific size ranges and few overlapping year-classes. Fish lengths from small mesh gillnets showed several modes between 35 cm and 62 cm throughout the time-series, while those of fish from large mesh gillnets and linetrawls ranged between 62-68 cm and 54-62 cm, respectively. Indices describing the physiological condition of Atlantic Cod varied at both seasonal and annual scales: the liver (hepatosomatic index) and gutted body condition (Fulton's K condition factor) declined over winter and early spring (while the gonadosomatic index increased), then improved over summer after spawning. These trends varied annually over the time-series, but generally declined in 2004-16. Both length and weight-at-age (6+ years) have decreased since the early part of each time-series."

Vigilance (scan rates) increased with the vigour of human activity and the birds were more vigilant in the higher shove zones, but there tons no corresponding decrease in food searching (peck rates). Prey capture rates of Oystercatcher and Curlew apparently increased with moderately close human disturbance. Undisturbed birds may not have been foraging at maximum rates and vested periodically during the low tide period. Characteristic avoidance behaviour elicited by disturbance differed between the species; Curlew and Redshank typically stopped feeding and, if they left, flew away, whereas Oystercatcher walked away. This difference may be related to plumage crypsis. Flight distances of all species were very low. Habituation may be an important response to regular but benign disturbance, reducing the disturbance-induced decrease in feeding time to a level which may be compensated for, at least in summer within the normal late-tide foraging period."

The way and extent animals react to these stress factors depend on their individual emotional reactivity. The objective of the present study was to determine in sheep relationships between reactivity profiles measured during rearing, plasma cortisol levels in blood collected at exsanguination, and metabolic activity in the post-mortem muscle. During the rearing period INRA401 lambs (n = 267) showed coherence in their responses to situations representing different contexts of novelty,social isolation and presence of man. Vigilance and high-pitched bleating were the most often occurring behaviours. Highest levels of these behaviours were observed during novelty and social isolation. Lambs with higher plasma cortisol levels at exsanguination produced meat with lower pH 3 h (r = -0.19, p = 0.003)and 24 h post-mortem(r = -0.13,p = 0.05). Multiple regression analysis found that more socially attracted lambs and lambs performing more high-pitched bleating had higher muscle temperature 3 h post-mortem (p < 0.001). explaining 23.5% of variability. More vigilant lambs had higher pH (r = 0.14, p = 0.02) 3 h post-mortem. Multiple regression including both cortisol and vigilance as explanatory variable was significant (p < 0.01) and explained 12.8% of variability of pH 3 h post-mortem. In the present study, slaughter day, that is, day-to-day variations in the slaughter context, explained 18.4% of the variability in cortisol levels and 25.0-72.7% of variability in post-mortem muscle measurements. When analyses were based on averages per category created according to cortisol levels at exsanguination, to reduce the variability due to slaughter days, behavioural traits (vigilance and social attractiveness of flock-mates) explained statistically about 50% of variability in cortisol levels at exsanguination, and pre-slaughter cortisol levels explained up to 50% of variability of ultimate pH. Relationships between post-mortem muscle metabolism and expressions of social distress and reactivity to novelty suggest that reactivity profile may predict stress reactions during slaughter period and that social disturbances and novel environment in the slaughterhouse may be major causes of stress.

These calls consist of a series of notes uttered while flying away from the nest. Less often, the call is given while flying to the nest. It is heard during nest-building, incubation, brooding, and nestling care. The behavior is found in emberizid finches and icterines in North America, and possibly muscicapids (Sylviinae) in Europe. It occurs almost exclusively in birds nesting in marshes or grasslands. Birds giving this call could incur a great cost if predators locate nests using these calls. Proposed benefits of calling include reduction of harassment by males, discouragement of settlement by females, promotion of anti-predatory vigilance by mates, advertisement of receptivity for copulation, and distraction of potential predators away from the nest. The reduction of harassment and increased vigilance hypotheses have the strongest support. The behavior is more common in species in which visibility of birds close to the ground is poor and in which the intra-sexual competition among males is intense which thus increases the risk that an already mated female will be mistaken for an intruding male."

The much larger bearded seal, Erignathus barbatus, hauls out on the edges of wide leads or large holes in the ice, or on the points of small ice floes, and also faces both the water and downwind. Ice-associated seals which are not threatened by surface predators do not show these behaviour patterns."

Based on this index, three pistachio tree orchards were studied and classified into two levels of vigour: high and low. The results obtained have discriminated the production per tree, which is strongly related to yield. Regarding the nutritional quality parameters, significant differences were not observed between vigour levels, although the most vigorous trees have shown nuts with a higher percentage of fibre and protein. In terms of phenology, there have not been differences between trees of different vigour, only a slight advance of some phenological stages has been observed in several high-vigour trees. Triangular tests have been made successfully to discriminate the origin of the dry nut and the vigour of the trees. In conclusion, for a given nut quality within a given orchard, the NDVI is a good index to classify different areas according to productive capacity and can be useful to apply variable management, irrigation and fertilization according to vigour."

This sensitivity has been demonstrated in many solitary, nocturnal, small mammals which may fall victim to ambush predators. We tested the response of Cape ground squirrels, a diurnal, group-living small mammal, to the presence of predator (black-backed jackal) faeces and non-predator (black wildebeest) dung in baited traps, and also predator faeces and non-predator dung outside their burrows. The squirrels showed a significantly higher avoidance of traps scented with predator faeces than both control and non-predator dung-scented traps. They also took significantly longer to emerge from burrows that had predator faeces outside compared with control burrows and burrows with non-predator dung outside and showed a trend for higher vigilance once they emerged from burrows with predator faeces outside. We argue that as diurnal group-living reduces a reliance on olfactory cues, this species is more likely to rely on visual cues and the vigilance of other individuals than nocturnal solitary species that have been the focus of most studies up till now. As a result, squirrels very quickly return to normal behaviour after exposure to a predator cue. Level of sociality is likely to influence responses to olfactory cues of predators and should be the focus of further studies."

Since 1958, it has had five moderate/major movements that catastrophically damaged the intersecting U.S. Highway 101, along with persistent slow wet-season movements and a long-term accelerating trend due to coastal erosion. Multiple remote sensing approaches, borehole measurements, and hydrological observations have been integrated to interpret the motion behaviors of the slide. Pixel offset tracking of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images was carried out to reconstruct the 3-D displacement field of the 2019 major event, and the results agree well with field measurements. A 12-year displacement history of the landslide from 2007 to 2019 has been retrieved by incorporating offsets from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model (DEM) gradients and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing of ALOS and Sentinel-1 images. Comparisons with daily/hourly ground precipitation reveal that the motion dynamics are predominantly controlled by intensity and temporal pattern of rainfall. A new empirical threefold rainfall threshold was therefore proposed to forecast the dates for the moderate/major movements. This threshold relies upon antecedent water-year and previous 3-day and daily precipitation and was able to represent observed movement periods well. Adaptation of our threshold methodology could prove useful for other large, deep landslides for which temporal forecasting has long been generally intractable. The averaged characteristic hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity were estimated as 6.6 x 10(-6) m/s and 6.6 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, respectively, based on the time lags between rainfall pulses and slide accelerations. Hydrologic modeling using these parameters helps to explain the ability of the new rainfall threshold."

In this study, I examine the influence of different characteristics of the nesting habitat on breeding success, predation, and the nesting behaviours of Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) in South Australia to help understand potential fitness benefits, costs or trade-offs associated with nesting habitat selection. I found that neither predation nor vigilance were influenced by the characteristics of the nest. However, nest type was an important factor for both breeding success and thermoregulation: birds nesting in rock nests had the highest hatching and breeding success, while individuals nesting in artificial nests engaged more in maintenance behaviours, suggesting that thermoregulation demands may be the most important factors for nest site selection in Little Penguins."

In total, 252 wolf attacks on moose and 64 attacks on roe deer were registered during 4200 km of snow tracking in 28 wolf territories. Average chase distances were 76 in for moose and 237 in for roe deer, a difference likely due to variation in body size and vigilance between prey species. A model including prey species, outcome of the attack, and snow depth explained 15-19% of the variation found in chase distances, with shorter chase distances associated with greater snow depth and with successful attacks on moose but not on roe deer. Wolf hunting success did not differ between prey species (moose 43%, roe deer 47%) but in 11% of the wolf attacks on moose at least one moose was injured but not killed, whereas no injured roe deer survived. Compared with most North American wolf studies chase distances were shorter, hunting success was greater, and fewer moose made a stand when attacked by wolves in our study. Differences in wolf encounters with moose and roe deer likely result from different anti-predator behaviour and predator-prey history between prey species."
"Jacobsen, Odd W.; Ugelvik, Morten",A case of polygyny in the Eurasian Wigeon Anas penelope,Wildfowl,46,72,75,,1995,"A case of polygyny in the Eurasian Wigeon is described. The presence of a second female (F2) on the male's defended area in the lake may have been due to an especially high abundance of an important food (chironomids) prior to breeding. During prelaying, egg-laying and parts of the incubation period, the inter-mate distance between the male and the two females decreased. The male became more vigilant as the season progressed when staying with both F1 and F2. It is concluded that guarding by the male must reduce the occurrence of extra-pair copulation attempts on his females in order to increase his own lifetime reproductive success."

Recently, however, it has been suggested that territory-holding passerines engaging in highly aggressive defensive behaviour are likely to pay a cost in terms of reduced vigilance for avian predators. To examine this further, two defensive options (combat and threat display) were evoked and observed in territorial European Robins Erithacus rubecula, in both winter and summer. It was found that Robins that engaged in combat during simulated territorial intrusion were significantly slower to react to a stuffed Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, than those eliciting threat display. Therefore, the decreased vigilance in escalated fighting may result in higher vulnerability to predation, and this might help, in part, to explain why threat display is favoured over direct combat. Moreover, the mean time to evade the predator was significantly longer in summer than in winter in threat-displaying Robins. In addition to this finding, a clear difference in the type of behaviour adopted between the seasons was observed, with lower incidence of combatative response during the winter months. This difference in response to the appearance of a predator is discussed in relation to reduced levels of safe cover, a reduction in the availability of alternative prey during the winter months and to seasonal fluctuations in plasma androgen levels."

Nevertheless, there is no general agreement as to whether recognition of predator odours is dependent upon experience. We conducted an experiment on European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus naive to any contact with predators and we investigated (1) whether they possessed a mechanism for the recognition of the odour of a predator, and (2) how they responded behaviourally and physiologically to that odour. We used fox Vulpes vulpes faeces as the source of the predator odour and sheep Ovis aries faeces as a nonpredator control odour. The experiments were conducted in small outdoor enclosures where the animals were kept singly. We recorded patterns of vigilance, activity and feeding, and changes in glucocorticoids and body mass. The rabbits showed a clear antipredator response to the presence of fox faeces, whereas they behaved neutrally in response to sheep odour. The response consisted of increased avoidance and vigilance while feeding and more investigation before feeding. Furthermore, the rabbits showed a physiological alarm response, that is, an increased responsiveness of their adrenocortical system and weight loss. However, the total activity budget, measured as time spent outside the burrow, the time spent feeding, and the amount of food ingested remained largely stable during the experiment. We conclude that rabbits recognised predator odours and that this recognition was independent of experience. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, information on patch quality may come at a cost if, when foraging within a risky (micro) environment, foragers allocate more attention to predator detection and consequently allocate less attention to assessing resource patchiness, that is, the cost of multitasking. Foragers may also benefit from alternative means of assessing predation risk that may not entirely conflict with foraging (e. g., vigilance postures are often incompatible with foraging and thus patch assessment). In particular, prey may eavesdrop on the alarm calls of heterospecifics that provide public information about the presence of a potential predator. To investigate these 2 effects, multitasking and eavesdropping, we used giving-up densities (GUDs) to quantify the ability of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) to assess resource heterogeneity (patchiness) under different regimes of predation risk. GUDs were collected over a distance from burrow gradient representing increasing predation risk and provide evidence that risk affected cotton rats' patch assessment abilities in 2 ways. First, under greater risk, cotton rats reduced their foraging time (i.e., higher GUDs) and hence time available for patch assessment. Second, when the effects of foraging time are removed, cotton rats still showed poorer patch assessment (i.e., ability to equalized GUDs between resource patches) in riskier habitats, that is, the cost of multitasking. In the second experiment, we demonstrate that cotton rats eavesdrop on the alarm vocalizations of blue jays and increase their perceived risk of predation during jay alarms, while simultaneously compromising their patch assessment performance."

Such sun-orienting has been suggested to represent a visual display to conspecifics but other explanations have not been thoroughly examined. We observed the orientation of wintering Snowy Owls to both the sun and the wind, and their perching behaviour during two winters in central Saskatchewan, Canada. We proposed three new explanations for sun orientation in addition to the display hypothesis: thermoregulation, hunting and defence against predators. On sunny days, 44% of 710 Owls faced the sun; this was non-random because few did so on overcast days. Sun- as opposed to wind-orienting was strongly associated with weather conditions. Logistic regressions indicated that at temperatures below -13 degrees C and at wind speeds greater than about 18km/h, Owls tended to orient to the wind rather than to the sun. The likelihood of wind-orienting increased if the Owl perched above the ground, whereas the likelihood of sun-orientating increased slightly when the Owl was sitting on the ground. There was no difference between the sexes in orienting behaviour. Snowy Owls seemed to prioritize wind-orienting for thermoregulation but the results are also consistent with the idea that sun-orientation can reduce heat loss. Facing into the sun did not support the hunting explanation because the birds would have been blinded and not able to see prey, but was consistent with the protection explanation if it helps to increase vigilance against enemies. Although we cannot completely rule out the display explanation, the spatial context of sunning Owls and a lack of a sex effect makes it unlikely that this is the main function. Instead, Owls seem to trade-off wind- vs. sun-orienting according to the prevailing weather conditions and do so mainly to thermoregulate and perhaps to maintain vigilance."

However, because individuals have limited attention, focusing on a particular aspect of their acoustic environment may affect their ability to allocate attention elsewhere. Some previous studies support the distracted prey hypothesis, which suggests that animals may be distracted by any stimuli, inhibiting their ability to detect approaching predators. In this study, we further tested the distracted prey hypothesis by employing playback experiments to simultaneously examine the relative effects of 3 types of noises-anthropogenic sounds, conspecific nonalarm sounds, and heterospecific nonalarm sounds-as distractors for common mynas (Acridotheres tristis). We used 3 different stimuli: motorcycle noise, social common myna calls, and social red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) calls. We first examined myna response to each stimulus by measuring time allocation to various behaviors immediately before and during broadcasting the 3 playbacks. We then studied how these stimuli affected their antipredator behavior by measuring the distance at which they fled from an approaching predator (flight initiation distance). We found that mynas responded to all 3 stimuli by delaying their return to relaxed behavior following the playbacks compared with a silent treatment. In contrast to the distracted prey hypothesis, we found that mynas fled at greater distances when hearing red-vented bulbul social vocalizations than during our silent treatment. This suggests that rather than distracting, some social vocalizations may enhance prey vigilance and lead to earlier flight."

Because predation risk can be a cost in desert granivores, we predicted that kangaroo rats (Dipodomys) should weigh the risk of predation when deciding which behavioural option to pursue. We manipulated apparent predation risk of the giant kangaroo rat, D. ingens, and the desert kangaroo rat, D. deserti, and predicted they should be more vigilant and show greater defensive behaviour to the more dangerous stimulus of a real snake than to an artificial snake decoy. Results showed that kangaroo rats decreased foraging with increased vigilance when the snake and decoy were present. The largest decrease in foraging was in response to the live snake, and both species oriented towards, approached and footdrummed more in the presence of the live snake than the decoy. The species also differed in their antipredator behaviour: D. ingens footdrummed more and spent more time within striking distance of the snake than the decoy. Dipodomys deserti spent more time within Im of the snake than the decoy and kicked sand at the snake. Sand kicking was never observed in D. ingens. We conclude that kangaroo rats are able to discriminate predation risk. They decrease foraging and increase vigilance in the presence of live snakes to assess risk and may approach and footdrum as a pursuit deterrent to communicate to the snake its chances of ambush are no longer available to cause the snake to leave. Sand kicking may function to harass the snake to cause it to leave. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Recent fissioning of one troop has created a vagrant group that is denied access to official feeding sites by other troops, and which visits major tourist sites less often. Using focal follows and instantaneous sampling, this study compared behavioral differences between two troops of provisioned and one troop of non-provisioned macaques. Kruskal-Wallis tests showed that the proportion of scans individuals devoted to foraging and vigilance differed significantly between the three groups (foraging chi(2) =10.19, df = 2, p < 0.05; vigilance chi(2)=9.35, df = 2, p <0.05), whereas those devoted to feeding and grooming did not. As expected, foraging was highest in the non-provisioned troop. Whilst the proportion of feeding records individuals allocated to natural and tourist foods did not differ significantly between the three groups, only macaques from provisioned groups were observed to feed on official provisions, and only those from the non-provisioned group fed on waste food at the rubbish tip. Differences in the diet of provisioned and non-provisioned macaques are discussed with respect to the available foods. Provisioning had no effect on the distance to nearest conspecifics, the rate of interaction with humans or the proportion of human-primate interactions initiated by macaques. The effectiveness of official provisioning and the welfare implications of this and tourist feeding are also discussed."

Theory predicts that different vigilance patterns are optimal for the detection of different predator types. We suggest that birds of different individual state might also differ in their speed of response dependent upon predator type. We used laboratory trials of wild caught chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) to determine how between individual differences in chaffinch behaviour and state correlate with latency to react to a ground predator model (domestic cat), thus providing a comparison with previous work in the same model system using aerial predator models. In experiment 1, we observed chaffinch responses to a moving cat model, simulating a stalking predator. In experiment 2, we used a camouflaged cat model simulating an ambush predator. Both experiments show evidence suggesting heavier individuals (which previous literature has linked to impaired flight performance) responded more quickly to the model cat. Heavier individuals also had shorter interscan intervals. In contrast to a previous study, both experiments found individuals with a higher intake rate were not faster at responding to the cat model. In addition, individuals in experiment 1 that head turned more while scanning were slower to respond to the stalking cat model. Our work suggests that although heavier individuals may have impaired escape performance they appear to show behavioural compensation by allocating more attention to anti-predator behaviour and by modifying their interscan intervals, resulting in faster response times to a ground predator. We suggest more experiments investigating response time to different predatory types and explicitly manipulating state to elucidate cause and effect."

In other primate species, close-range calls are typically given in socially relevant situations, for example, to gain access to grooming partners or food. Quite contrarily, we tested a number of hypotheses and found that Diana monkey 'clear' calls primarily function to avoid predation. Call rates were significantly elevated when predation threat was high, for instance when the visibility was poor, when the group spread was large, when the group was not associated with other monkey species. or after alarm calls. Call rates were not significantly elevated, however, in circumstances of high social competition, for instance when the group spread was small, during resting phases, while feeding oil clumped food sources, or when foraging in the periphery where inter-group encounters were more likely to occur. Calling was contagious in that calls typically elicited vocal responses from out-of-sight group members within a few seconds. Because of this, callers can effectively monitor a much larger area than is visually accessible to single individuals, suggesting that Diana monkey clear calls act as an essential element in a mutualistic system of co-ordinated vigilance."
"Parker, Edwin J.; Hill, Russell A.; Koyama, Nicola F.",Behavioral responses to spatial variation in perceived predation risk and resource availability in an arboreal primate,ECOSPHERE,13,,,10.1002/ecs2.3945,2022,"Prey species must often face a trade-off between acquiring resources and minimizing predation risk. The spatial variation in predation risk across a landscape, as perceived by prey across their foraging or home range, creates a landscape of fear by which individuals modify their behavior in response to the level of perceived risk. Here, we explored the influence of perceived predation risk, habitat features associated with risk, and fruit availability, on the spatial variation in behavior of the endangered forest-dwelling samango monkey (Cercopithecus albogularis schwarzi). We collected behavioral and location data on two habituated samango monkey groups in the Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa, between 2012 and 2016. We further collected location data of the samango monkey's acoustically distinct alarm call, which has an unambiguous association with aerial predators, to spatially map perceived risk across the landscape. Using generalized linear mixed models, we found that perceived risk from eagles significantly influenced the spatial distribution of critical life-functioning behaviors, with samango monkeys increasing feeding and foraging in high-risk areas. To mitigate this risk, samangos increased cohesion between group members, which subsequently reduced vigilance levels. Group cohesion further increased in high-risk areas with abundant fruit, relative to high-risk, fruit-poor areas, demonstrating the monkey's foraging/risk trade-off. Feeding was also reduced in areas of low canopy height, while vigilance decreased with increasing understory visibility and distance from sleep site, showing the influence of landscape features on risk perception from other predator guilds. Thus, for arboreal species foraging in a 3-D landscape, risk perception may occur at multiple scales and in response to multiple predator guilds. Only moving was influenced by fruit availability, either due to moving between localized food patches or from escaping high-risk areas following feeding bouts. These findings highlight that risk-taking in samango monkeys is only associated with behaviors fundamental to survival at a given location and that increased cohesion between neighbors is the main antipredator response in this species."
"Moreau, T.; Tran, N.; Aublanc, J.; Tison, C.; Le Gac, S.; Boy, F.",Impact of long ocean waves on wave height retrieval from SAR altimetry data,ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH,62,1434,1444,10.1016/j.asr.2018.06.004,2018,"SAR altimetry is a new high-resolution operation mode exploited in new-generation altimeter missions, such as Sentinel-3. It takes advantage of its enhanced along-track resolution to make measurements of sea surface height variations in much greater detail than what can be achieved with conventional low resolution instruments (e.g. the Jason-3 altimeter). However, contrary to what is observed for conventional altimetry, long-wavelength ocean waves of a few hundred meters (swell and extreme wind waves) are no longer fully imaged in the instrument ground cells, and SAR waveforms have distorted shapes in such wave conditions. This affects the final retrieval of significant wave height-(SWH). This paper analyzes the impact of long ocean waves on SAR mode data by using both Cryosat-2 measurements and simulated data. Results from these two approaches are in good agreement and show that the estimated parameters from SAR-altimetry waveforms are particularly noisy under long-wave conditions and also biased when compared with conventional altimetry data. Additionally, we found evidence that these impacts are different between the two directions (along and cross-track directions) due to the asymmetry of the SAR-altimetry footprint. Simulations indicate that statistics of sea surface elevations within the SAR-altimetry footprint deviate from Gaussian behavior. The assumption commonly used for ocean retracking algorithms is therefore inaccurate. The sensitivity of SAR-mode altimetry data to long waves is a key issue for the ocean altimetry community, which is concerned to ensure the continuity of high-quality time series of the global sea-surface topography in future years. This is not only an issue for these new-generation radar altimeters (Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-6) but also for all innovative techniques or processing methodologies capable of providing higher spatial resolution of the ocean surface.

However, recent advancements in satellite remote sensing, including the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) offer new tools for generating satellite derived bathymetry (SDB). The key payload onboard ICESat-2 is the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a micro-pulse, photon-counting LiDAR system, simultaneously emitting six separate 532 nm beams at 10 kHz pulse rate. However, despite its high resolution, the major limitation for bathymetry is that ICESat-2 only provides along-track height profiles, leaving observation gaps between the parallel ground tracks. Merging ICESat-2 observations with optical multispectral imagery, as demonstrated herein, provides an effective solution for deriving a full scene of water depth in light of the spectral attenuation behavior.This study aims to combine ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 optical data to derive shallow water bathymetry (depth <20 m) at six islands and reefs in the South China Sea. ICESat-2 ATL03 point clouds of georeferenced photons are first filtered to determine the seafloor elevation along the ground track. Results indicate a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.26-0.61 m as compared with independent observations from an airborne LiDAR campaign. Next, three semi-empirical functions, namely the Modified Linear/Polynomial/Exponential Ratio Models with its kernel formed by the log ratio between Sentinel-2's green and blue bands, are used to fit the spectral data with ICESat-2 height profiles. After water depth mapping using the trained model, independent ICESat-2 point clouds are used to validate the Sentinel-2 derived bathymetry. The RMSE values of the three models using the weighted average of multiple images for these six islands are within 0.50-0.90 m in 0-15 m deep. We also demonstrate that a synthesis of satellite laser altimetry and optical remote sensing can produce SDB results that potentially meet the requirement of category C in Zones of Confidence (ZOC) of the Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) in 0-8 m deep. It is foreseen that ICESat-2 will be a helpful tool for mapping coastal and shallow waters around the world especially where bathymetric data are unavailable."

Yet, the specific role of sleep in brain maturation is a complete mystery. In this article, the developmental psychobiology of sleep regulation is conceptualized within the context of close links to the control of arousal, affect, and attention. The interactions among these systems are considered from an ontogenetic and evolutionary biological perspective. A model is proposed for the development of sleep and arousal regulation with the following major tenets:1. Sleep and vigilance represent opponent processes in a larger system of arousal regulation.2. The regulation of sleep, arousal, affect, and attention overlap in physiological, neuroanatomical, clinical, and developmental domains.3. Complex interactions among these regulatory systems are modulated and integrated in regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC).4. Changes at the level of PFC underlie maturational shifts in the relative balance across these regulatory systems (such as decreases in the depth/length of sleep and increased capacity for vigilance and attention), which occur with normal development.5. The effects of sleep deprivation (including alterations in attention, emotions, and goal-directed behaviors) also involve changes at the level of PFC integration across regulatory systems.This model is then discussed in the context of developmental pathology in the control of affect and attention, with an emphasis on sleep changes in depression."
"Larsen, Megan J.; Sherwen, Sally L.; Rault, Jean-Loup",Number of nearby visitors and noise level affect vigilance in captive koalas,APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,154,76,82,10.1016/j.applanim.2014.02.005,2014,"Understanding human-animal interactions is particularly important for institutions that display animals to the public due to the frequent, and sometimes intense, interactions with unfamiliar humans. Past research has shown that visitors can have a negative impact on the welfare of a wide range of captive zoo species through an activation of the stress response, which influences energy metabolism. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) evolved on a specific diet of extremely low energy content and is therefore likely to be particularly susceptible to any effects from stress. However, the knowledge of visitor effects on captive koala behaviour and welfare is almost non-existent. The effects of visitor number (Study 1) and visitor noise (Study 2) were investigated in a population of captive koalas. In Study 1, behavioural observations were conducted on koalas across a total of eight days: four days of high visitor attendance and four days of low visitor attendance. Scan sampling was used every 2 min to record individual koala behaviour, position in enclosure and proximity to the boardwalk. The number of visitors within a 5 m radius on the boardwalk, hereafter referred to as 'nearby visitors', was also recorded for each scan. In Study 2, the effect of visitor noise was investigated using audio recordings of visitor noise taken from the study site in three levels of treatment (No visitors, Quiet visitors and Loud visitors). Each koala was randomly allocated each noise treatment once daily over eight days and the presence or absence of vigilance behaviour was recorded. Study 1 demonstrated that an increase in the number of nearby visitors, but not total daily visitor number, resulted in increased time spent vigilant in the koalas. Study 2 showed that an increase in visitor noise treatment resulted in increased time spent vigilant in the koalas. These results show that koalas do respond behaviourally to visitors, supporting the value of behavioural observations as a monitoring tool to assess visitor-related disturbance in koalas. The welfare implications of these behavioural changes remain to be determined, as well as adequate management strategies to minimise negative visitor effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Animals migrating outside of protected areas can be exposed to greater human pressure, and this effect can be stronger when humans are perceived to be a predation risk, such as during hunting seasons. Using four consecutive years of satellite telemetry data (n = 138 migration events), we compared habitat selection, movement, and behavior of a large partially migratory herbivore while migrating through a heterogeneous landscape in spring and fall. We tested the hypothesis that fall hunting exacerbates the response of a large herbivore exposed to human disturbance while migrating through a road network. All elk (Cervus elaphus) selected greater forest cover, reduced movement rates, and avoided roads during fall-day than in any other season or time of day. Avoidance of roads was reduced during spring at night, for example, the time period of no hunting with fewest people on roads. Elk using stopovers in fall displayed different seasonal and diurnal behaviors between sexes in response to the disturbance. Females used steeper terrain during fall-day and males did not use this strategy in fall. Male avoidance of roads was much stronger than females during fall-day and males were less likely to cross a road during fall. Such responses are probably linked to higher hunting pressure on males vs. females. Finally, we found that elk spent more time feeding during spring migration compared to the fall migration and elk vigilance was > 3 times higher in the fall hunting season. Our results provide insights into the effect of fear of humans on the ecology of both sexes of a migrating large herbivore when using stopovers. Such changes in behavior and stopover use might affect animal fitness by decreasing foraging, cause displacement from high-quality habitats, or affect the permeability of migration route stopovers."

In Patagonia, invasive European hares compete with livestock for forage but change their behavior when exposed to native predator odors. In this experiment, we aimed to test if livestock guarding dog odor triggers fear in this herbivore and reduces hare presence in different habitats of sheep grazing lands of Chilean Patagonia, where these lagomorphs are an invasive species. The results showed that European hares reduce their visits to scented places with and without horizontal vegetation. We also discovered that this invasive species reduced foraging time when the odor was present in places with dense horizontal vegetation. These results suggested that livestock guarding dogs could also serve as a European hare deterrent and decrease competition with livestock, allowing greater production and supporting sustainable livestock farming.

"Dutour, Mylene; Suzuki, Toshitaka N.; Wheatcroft, David",Great tit responses to the calls of an unfamiliar species suggest conserved perception of call ordering,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,74,,,10.1007/s00265-020-2820-7,2020,"Many species of birds produce distinct calls when mobbing predators. These calls often recruit nearby conspecifics and heterospecifics to help drive the predators away. In some species, such as members of the family Paridae, mobbing calls are composed of multiple elements that seem to follow a characteristic order. Previous work in parids demonstrated that note ordering influences both the responses of conspecifics and some other co-occurring Paridae species. Cross-species sensitivity to note ordering could result from individuals' learning to associate individual heterospecific calls with threats or, rather, because the typical note orderings are shared across species. Here, we test these hypotheses by assessing the responses of European great tits (Parus major) to the naturally and artificially ordered calls of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), a North American species. In response to the naturally ordered mobbing calls of chickadees, we found that great tits exhibit vigilance and rapidly approach the sound source, behaviors that were indistinguishable to those expressed in response to conspecific calls. If learned associations are necessary for sensitivity to note ordering, then a key prediction is that great tit responses to naturally ordered and artificially reversed chickadee calls should be similar (and weak). In contrast to this prediction, we found that great tits were less vigilant, but approach the sound source in response to artificially reversed chickadee calls. These findings suggest that perception of note ordering patterns is conserved. However, they are also in agreement with a perception bias hypothesis: that the first notes of the call mask the notes that follow them, preventing the receiver from perceiving the second part of the call. Although we provide evidence against perception bias, further research is needed to convincingly disentangle these two hypotheses."
"Anson, Jennifer R.; Dickman, Chris R.; Boonstra, Rudy; Jessop, Tim S.",Stress Triangle: Do Introduced Predators Exert Indirect Costs on Native Predators and Prey?,PLoS ONE,8,1,9,,2013,"Non-consumptive effects of predators on each other and on prey populations often exceed the effects of direct predation. These effects can arise from fear responses elevating glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels (predator stress hypothesis) or from increased vigilance that reduces foraging efficiency and body condition (predator sensitive foraging hypothesis); both responses can lead to immunosuppression and increased parasite loads. Non-consumptive effects of invasive predators have been little studied, even though their direct impacts on local species are usually greater than those of their native counterparts. To address this issue, we explored the non-consumptive effects of the invasive red fox Vulpes vulpes on two native species in eastern Australia: a reptilian predator, the lace monitor Varanus varius and a marsupial, the ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus. In particular, we tested predictions derived from the above two hypotheses by comparing the basal glucocorticoid levels, foraging behaviour, body condition and haemoparasite loads of both native species in areas with and without fox suppression. Lace monitors showed no GC response or differences in haemoparasite loads but were more likely to trade safety for higher food rewards, and had higher body condition, in areas of fox suppression than in areas where foxes remained abundant. In contrast, ringtails showed no physiological or behavioural differences between fox-suppressed and control areas. Predator sensitive foraging is a non-consumptive cost for lace monitors in the presence of the fox and most likely represents a response to competition. The ringtail's lack of response to the fox potentially represents complete naivete or strong and rapid selection to the invasive predator. We suggest evolutionary responses are often overlooked in interactions between native and introduced species, but must be incorporated if we are to understand the suite of forces that shape community assembly and function in the wake of biological invasions."

However, with a few exceptions (e.g. procellariformes and New World vultures), the evidence for the ecological relevance of olfaction in birds is sparse and inconsistent. This is the case even though birds retain the proper anatomical and neurological structures needed to use olfaction. Here, we examined whether a passerine bird responds to the chemical scent of predators in the laboratory. We exposed house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, to the olfactory cues of predatory and nonpredatory mammalian faeces and observed their behavioural response while feeding. Finches responded to both predator and nonpredator faecal cues, but they responded to the predator cues more strongly in some analyses. For example, in response to both faecal treatments, finches delayed their first feeding, spent less time on the feeder as a whole and reduced feeding bout length; the bout length effect was particularly pronounced in the predator treatment. Vigilance did not increase but instead decreased during the faecal treatments, which may have reflected a strategy of minimizing time on the feeder (where the cue was presented). The behavioural effects of faecal cues weakened quickly over time and were most evident during the first 5 min of an observational session. Overall, our results show that finches can detect mammalian faecal cues and associate such cues with possible danger. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The aims of this study were to: (1) measure and quantify habitat-specific stem bite diameters of mountain nyala foraging on common natural plant species in two major habitat types (i.e. grasslands versus woodlands), and (2) quantify the bite rates (number of bites per minute) and the activity time budgets of mountain nyala as functions of habitat type and sex-age category. We randomly laid out three transects in each habitat type. Following each transect, through focal animal observations, we assessed and quantified stem diameters at point of browse (dpb), bite rates, and time budgets of mountain nyala in grasslands versus woodlands. Stern dpb provide a measure of natural giving-up densities (GUDs) and can be used to assess foraging costs and efficiencies, with greater stem dpb corresponding to lower costs and greater efficiencies. The results showed that stem dpb, bite rates, induced vigilance, and proportion of time spent in feeding differed between habitats. In particular, mountain nyala had greater stern dpb, higher bite rates, and spent a greater proportion of their time in feeding and less in induced vigilance in the grasslands. In addition, adult females had the highest bite rates, and the browse species Solanum marginatum had the greatest stem dpb. Generally, grasslands provide the mountain nyala with several advantages over the woodlands, including offering lower foraging costs, greater safety, and more time for foraging. The study advocates how behavioural indicators and natural GUDs are used to examine the habitat use of the endangered mountain nyala through applying non-invasive techniques. We conclude that the resulting measures are helpful for guiding conservation and management efforts and could be applicable to a number of endangered wildlife species including the mountain nyala."

Here, we aim to elucidate the processes behind a previously established age-related foraging distribution of red knots (Calidris canutus canutus) in their main wintering area in West Africa (Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania). Based on 10 years of observations of 1232 uniquely color-ringed individuals of 1 to 18+ years old, we examined whether the observed age-related foraging distribution resulted from 1) spatial differences in mortality or 2) age-related shifts in habitat use. Using multistate capture-recapture modeling, we showed that with age foraging red knots moved away from the shoreline, that is, to areas with fewer surprise attacks by raptors. Considering uncertainties in the subjective gradient in predation danger with increasing distance from shore (as assessed from correlations between vigilance and distance from shore in foraging birds), we applied 2 different danger zone boundaries, at 40 m and 500 m from shore. Between years, red knots had a much higher chance to move from the dangerous nearshore area to the safe area beyond (71-78% and 26% for 40-m and 500-m danger zone boundary, respectively), than vice versa (4% and 14%). For neither danger zone boundary value did we find differences in annual mortality for individuals using either dangerous or safe zone, so the move away from the shore with age is attributed to individual careers rather than differential mortality. We argue that longitudinal studies like ours will reveal that ontogenetic shifts in habitat use are more common than so far acknowledged."

Risk is likely perceived differently by individuals in relation to among-individual differences in correlated behavioral traits, that is, syndromes or personalities. Given that animals can avoid the risk of predation/disturbance through modification of their habitat use, we might expect individuals of differing behavioral types to adopt contrasting tactics of habitat use when faced with risky or stressful situations. We studied the relationship between habitat use and among-individual variation in behavioral profile in a population of roe deer. We hypothesized that an individual's habitat use tactics should be related to their capacity to cope with risky situations. In particular, we predicted that more reactive (risk-averse) roe deer, with relatively high behavioral response and high body temperature at capture, long flight distances and which were more vigilant during feeding, should use riskier open habitat less, particularly when risk is high. We found that although the use of open habitat during the day was negatively correlated with the indices of reactivity at capture, it was also positively correlated with indices of reactivity while foraging in open habitat. Furthermore, most of the behavioral parameters we measured were intercorrelated and moderately repeatable, potentially indexing personality traits. We conclude that there is substantial interindividual variability in how individuals manage risky situations which imposes constraints on how they are able to exploit high-risk habitats, suggesting the existence of a risk management syndrome in this large herbivore."

In this present study, an optimum combination of multi-date Sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR data (VV mode) and RADARSAT-2 (R-2) fine quad polarization SAR (HH, VV, VH, and HV) data was used for crop classification at the field level, using machine learning techniques. Four dates of S-1 data, between July and August, and three dates R-2 quad pol data between September and October were used during the Kharif season of 2019 for part of Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The study area's principal crops are rice and soybean, while minor crops are maize, pigeon pea, etc. A comprehensive approach combining principal component analysis, separability analysis, and layer-layer correlation was used to select the best seven dates/layers dataset for crop classification. Supervised machine learning classification algorithms of support vector machine (SVM), random forest, spectral angle mapper, and maximum likelihood classification were performed on the best set of S-1 and R-2 SAR selected dataset. Additionally, Wishart unsupervised classification was also performed on R-2 fully polarimetric data to classify the crops based on their scattering behavior. The results from five classification techniques were compared for their accuracy using ground truth data. It was observed that SVM, followed by Wishart, performed better than all other classification techniques regarding crop classification and area estimation accuracy. Overall, the study showed that an optimal combination of multi-date and multi-polarization SAR data from different satellites with a suitable classification technique is useful for crop area estimation at the field level, during Kharif season."

Intensities of vigilant and aggressive behavior were lowest among primiparous yearlings, intermediate among primiparous adults, and highest among multiparous adults, with differences being greatest during gestation and lactation and declining after the 1st emergence of young from the natal burrow. These differences suggest that both age and experience raising young improve territorial behaviors in this species. I also evaluated responses of female U. beldingi to a nonthreatening (caged) conspecific intruder placed in the maternal territory. Investigation of the intruder and aggression directed at the intruder were relatively low among multiparous females throughout the reproductive period, suggesting that these females were able to discern that the intruder did not pose a threat. Among primiparous adults, investigatory and aggressive responses toward the intruder were high during gestation but declined thereafter, suggesting that as the reproductive period progressed these females were better able to discriminate between a threatening and a nonthreatening stimulus. Among primiparous yearlings, investigatory and aggressive behaviors were low during gestation, and females spent about 30% of the duration of tests watching the intruder without overt vigilance. Investigatory and aggressive behaviors increased during lactation and declined to low levels after emergence of young from the natal burrow, suggesting that after an initial hesitancy to respond to the intruder, primiparous yearlings reacted to the intruder as a threat, but by the end of the reproductive period may have been able to determine that the caged intruder was not threatening. Overall, results of this study are consistent with the idea that both age and experience raising young influence maternal territorial behaviors and discrimination abilities in female U. beldingi."

Studies show that numerous species eavesdrop on heterospecific calls to gain information about predator presence. Responding to heterospecific calls may be a learned or innate response, determined by whether the response occurs with or without prior exposure to the call. In this study, we investigated the presence of eavesdropping behaviour in zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. This species is not known to possess a distinct alarm call to warn adult conspecifics of a threat, and could be relying on alarm calls of nearby heterospecifics for predator information. We used a playback experiment to expose captive zebra finches to three heterospecific sounds: an unfamiliar alarm call (from the chestnut-rumped thornbill Acanthiza uropygialis), a familiar alarm call, and a familiar control (both from the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala). These calls were chosen to test if the birds had learnt to distinguish between the function of the two familiar calls, and if the acoustic properties of the unfamiliar alarm indicated presence of a threat to the finches. Our results showed that in response to the thornbill alarm, the birds reduced the rate of production of short calls. However, this decrease was also seen when considering both short and distance calls in response to the control sound. An increase in latency to call was also seen after the control stimulus when compared to the miner alarm. The time spent scanning increased in response to all three stimuli, but this did not differ between stimuli. There were no significant differences when considering the stimulus by time interaction for any of the three vigilance measures. Overall, no strong evidence was found to indicate that the captive zebra finches were responding to the heterospecific alarm stimuli with anti-predator behaviour."

While kin selection or reciprocal altruism are typically invoked to explain such behaviours, several authors have conjectured that some alarm calls may instead be costly signals sent by prey to inform approaching predators that they have been detected. We develop a general game-theoretical model, the watchful babbler game, in which prey signal awareness to predators. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for alarm calls to function as honest signals. We show that signals can honestly reveal prey awareness if (1) the prey's sense of predation risk accurately reflects the probability that the predator is present, and (2) greater awareness of the predator allows the prey a greater chance of escape. When honest signalling is possible, the model predicts that prey will be more willing to signal when predators are common than when predators are rare, and that greater pursuit costs to the predator will allow cheaper signals by the prey.

Interspecific competition is often asymmetrical and the smaller carnivore is usually affected the most. We investigated the behavioural responses of two native species, the larger Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) and the smaller spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) to each other's odour and to that of an introduced predator, the feral cat (Felis catus), in north-west Tasmania, Australia. We used an experimental array of camera traps, in which carnivore scats were added as treatments. Behavioural responses exhibited by devils and quolls are indicative of a dominant predator-mesopredator relationship and suggest the potential for interspecific competition. The larger predator, the devil, was as vigilant at quoll odour as at control camera traps, but showed decreased vigilance at cat odour and did not avoid cat or quoll odours. The smaller predator, the spotted-tailed quoll, increased its vigilance near devil odour compared to control camera traps but did not avoid it. This experiment shows that assessing the behavioural responses of sympatric carnivores to each other's odour can help understand predator interactions and reveal the potential for interspecific competition. Understanding these interactions is crucial in managing and conserving carnivores.Animals navigate through an environment full of faecal odours left by predators, competitors and conspecifics. These odours provide information on both the immediate presence and the indirect risk of encountering a predator or an aggressive competitor. Tasmania's largest predator, the Tasmanian devil, coexists with the smaller spotted-tailed quoll and the introduced feral cat. We tested the behavioural responses of Tasmanian devils and spotted-tailed quolls to each other's faecal odour and to cat faecal odour. Behavioural patterns exhibited by predators in this experiment are indicative of a dominant predator-mesopredator relationship and suggest the potential for interspecific competition. Knowledge of the ecological interactions amongst sympatric carnivores can aid managers in making more informed decisions when trying to achieve specific conservation goals."
"Cunningham, Sean; Magrath, Robert D.",Functionally referential alarm calls in noisy miners communicate about predator behaviour,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,129,171,179,10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.05.021,2017,"Many vertebrates have alarm calls that warn conspecifics about danger, and some species even communicate about the type of predator or its behaviour, allowing for appropriate responses. However, such 'functionally referential' communication has been shown experimentally in only a handful of species, and requires demonstrating that individuals give acoustically distinct calls to different threats, and that the calls alone are sufficient to prompt listeners to behave as if a specific threat is present. We carried out model presentations, acoustic analyses and a playback experiment to test whether the alarm calls of noisy miners, Manorina melanocephala, are functionally referential. Miners gave different calls to airborne raptor models compared to terrestrial or perched raptor models, and even switched from 'aerial' alarm calls to 'chur' alarm calls when a hawk glider landed on the ground. They also behaved differently to these two types of threats, showing avoidance to aerial threats, including fleeing or freezing, but deterrent behaviour to terrestrial threats, including vigilance, approach and mobbing. The two alarm call types were acoustically distinct, and consistent with calls to live predators. Blind scoring of video revealed that birds responded appropriately to playbacks of alarm calls alone, typically fleeing to aerial alarm calls yet becoming vigilant, approaching and calling to chur calls. Noisy miners produce alarm calls that therefore meet both criteria for functional reference, and thus become one of the few bird species in which such calls have been confirmed. Many birds appear to give different calls to airborne predators compared to during mobbing of terrestrial or stationary predators, so functionally referential alarms are likely to be common and may often categorize predators by their behaviour and not simply their taxonomic type.

Predator cues also elicit antipredator responses, and previous research indicates that prey possess mechanisms to discriminate between the relative risk posed by particular predator cues, which mediates their investment in antipredator behaviors (i.e., Bthreatsensitive behavior). However, the salience of such predator cues may change according to perceived predation risk, which can vary temporally or spatially. We hypothesized that prey modify responses to predatory cues according to their recent experience with predators, which would prime prey to attend to predator-related cues. In the present study, we found that recent encounters with live tethered rattlesnakes increased perceived predation risk in free-ranging California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi), leading to concomitant increases in the intensity of antipredator behaviors displayed toward a predator model. The increase in antipredator behavior following snake encounters was higher toward the predator model than a novel object, suggesting that squirrels exhibit threat-sensitive responses toward objects resembling predators. However, squirrels did not treat either of these objects with caution, nor did they differ in antipredator behavior, when presented with the model or novel object when no live snake was encountered. This suggests that increased vigilance following predator encounters modulates responses to predator cues. Such increases in antipredator behavior could assist in detecting nearby predators quickly but could also have indirect effects on prey.Significance statementUnderresponding to predators could lead to death, while overresponding could reduce time spent on other fitnessrelated activities. Prey balance these costs by using environmental cues to modify antipredator responses. Detecting a live predator in the environment could indicate that the chance of predation is high, which may enhance preys' antipredator responses. We show that ground squirrels significantly enhance antipredator behaviors toward snake models and novel objects after encountering a live tethered rattlesnake predator. However, the predator model elicited greater antipredator behavior than the novel object following snake encounters, suggesting that squirrels are primed to attend to predator-related cues in this context. Both objects were treated similarly, and with less caution, when no snake was detected. Vigilance following predator interactions therefore mediates threatsensitive responses to subsequent predator cues."

To clarify this hypothesis, we introduced two prey species (10 Japanese dace, Tribolodon hakonensis, and 10 pale chub, Zacco platypus) into each experimental pond (in total, 8 ponds x 4 trials) in which benthic algae had been allowed to grow. The presence or absence of Far Eastern catfish, Silurus asotus, and a refuge for prey fish was used to produce four treatments. The presence of catfish and/or a refuge did not affect either the feeding behavior or growth rate of Japanese dace. In contrast, when catfish were present and no refuge was available, the incidence of bottom feeding for pale chub greatly decreased. Pale chub growth rate was low when catfish were present and a refuge was available, indicating that pale chub spent more of their time in the refuge and lost opportunities of acquiring food. Japanese dace can reach a threshold size at which the prey are safe from predation, but pale chub cannot, and this may explain the differences in response to predators of the two species."

These characteristics allow us to examine how flexibility in social interactions is modulated by the perception of risk and uncertainty related to other group members. We investigated whether male male interactions vary according to partner identity and presence of third parties in wild Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi). We used proportion of approaches followed by an embrace, an indicator of risk and uncertainty, or by grooming, an affiliative behaviour To confirm the monkeys' perception of risk or uncertainty we used aggression rates and time spent We collected data on eight adult spider monkey males: three of them belonged to one clique and the other live to another clique based on distinct patterns of residence. We found higher proportions of approaches followed by embraces and lower proportions of approaches followed by grooming between males of different cliques than between males of the same clique. In addition, we found higher aggression rates between males from different cliques. The proportions of approaches followed by embraces in the five-male clique were higher when the three-male clique was no longer in the group. The live males were more vigilant when the other three males were present in the group, indicating the monkeys perceived higher risk or uncertainty under these circumstances. We found lower proportions of approaches followed by grooming between two males when there was at least one other male in the subgroup than when there were only the two males. Our results provide evidence for behavioural flexibility in the interactions between spider monkey males as an example of how animals can cope with social challenges by adjusting then behaviour."

Ovary development was studied in paired females collected in 1995, 1996 and 1998. Male activity and behaviour were recorded in 1996 in order to assess the importance of mate-guarding in optimizing female resource acquisition. From arrival at the colony in late March until laying in mid-April, female Elders allocated on average 62% of the daylight hours to foraging by dabbling in inshore waters (<1 m water depth). In offshore waters (1-4 m depth) foraging by diving averaged 74% of the daylight hours. Paired males foraged an average of 17% of the day time in the inshore habitat, and closely attended their females during this time. The males actively defended their females in encounters with of her pairs and from single males. Defence events involving encounters with single males increased significantly from 9.2 times per hour to 17.5 times per hour by the time of laying. The frequency of interruption to female foraging did not change significantly as a result of the more frequent encounters towards the time of laying, being 4.0 times per hour before early April and 5.8 times per hour at the time of laying. Female ovary weights showed a significant increase from early April, indicating that resources obtained locally were allocated to egg production. The increase in encounters with single males suggests that extra-pair copulation may be a secondary reproductive strategy in male Elders at the time their females start to incubate. The present results emphasize the importance of pre-nesting foraging for female Elders in maximizing the nutrient intake in preparation for reproduction, and the importance of the behaviour of attendant males in protecting female foraging from interruptions from other males."
"Sargunaraj, Franklin; Kotler, Burt P.; St Juliana, Justin R.; Wielebnowski, Nadja",Stress as an adaptation II: Does experimental cortisol supplementation affect predation risk assessment in foraging gerbils?,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,18,587,598,,2017,"Background: Animals are well known for trading off food and safety, and we have previously shown for Allenby's gerbil (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) that the intensity of this trade-off changes with energetic state. Furthermore, we have shown that concentrations of corticosteroid metabolites in desert rodents' faeces change in response to changing levels of food availability, competitor density, and moonlight. This suggests that stress hormones play an important role in mediating the trade-off of food and safety and in managing foraging.Hypotheses: Higher concentrations of the exogenous stress hormone cortisol will increase gerbils' marginal valuation of energy (MVE) and their vigilance. In general, cortisol will mediate responses to slowly changing factors associated with food and safety, but not to rapidly changing ones.Methods: In order to test these hypotheses, we manipulated cortisol concentrations in a set of gerbils by injecting each subcutaneously with 21-day slow-release 0.01 mg cortisol pellets and compared their foraging behaviour with that of a control group. The experiment was conducted in a large outdoor vivarium where we could simulate features of the gerbils' desert environment, manipulate the presence of a predatory owl (i.e. a rapidly changing factor), and quantify patch use over the course of a lunar cycle from new moon to full moon (i.e. a slowly changing factor). Foraging behaviour was quantified by giving-up densities (GUDs; the amount of food left in a resource patch after foraging), time allocated to foraging, and harvest rate curves in artificial foraging patches (seed trays).Results: Giving-up densities were affected by the interaction of cortisol treatment and moon phase, but not the interaction of cortisol treatment and owl presence. Gerbils implanted with cortisol foraged longer, but harvested food more slowly (suggesting greater vigilance and apprehension), than placebo-treated gerbils. This reaffirms that glucocorticoids affect energy acquisition, and provides a physiological context to explain how foragers manage risk and the trade-off between food and safety."

Several hypotheses have suggested mechanisms to explain why larger groups disproportionately outperform smaller groups, including the skill pool and pool of competence effects. However, disentangling these potential mechanisms from the effects of group size alone has been challenging. Here, we first outline key ways in which group size can shape performance in innovative problem solving. We then detail the nonlinear nature of the mathematical relationship between group size and various measures of group performance. Finally, we use simulations to confirm that measures of group performance in innovative problem solving scale nonlinearly with group size, even in the absence of any other effect. Our study provides guidance on how best to evaluate hypotheses about group composition on innovative problem solving, and clarity to help future studies make appropriate assumptions when developing null hypotheses against which to test their empirical data.

The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of rearing practices on the behavior of whooping crane chicks. The birds were reared under three commonly used rearing techniques: parent reared (PR), hand reared (HR), and hand reared with exercise (HRE). Fifty-six whooping crane chicks were observed by focal animal sampling from hatch to 20 weeks of age. During these observations, occurrences of comfort behavior, aggression, foraging, nonvigilance, sleep, vigilance, and other types of behavior were collected. Data were analyzed using mixed models repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Behavior was affected by rearing treatment, age, and time of day. PR birds spent more time being vigilant than HR and HRE birds. An inverse correlation was found between percentage of time foraging and vigilant (r = -0.686, P < 0.0001).

Southern lapwing behaviours and their relation with flock size were studied, as well as the relationship between the frequency of behaviours and the period of the day. Results showed that the proportion of time spent in foraging and vigilance was higher during the morning, when small groups were more common, and decreased from midday on, when group size increased. Maintenance and inactivity (sleeping) behaviours presented the opposite pattern. Correlation between flock size and period of the day, and their similar effects on bird behaviour may be evidence that groups of different sizes could have different functions throughout the day. Our results show that southern lapwings seem to form smaller flocks for feeding in the beginning of the day and larger flocks later for different activities (e.g., maintenance and sleeping). In this sense, it is possible that group size variation throughout the day is related to different demands for specific behaviours (functions) of groups, according to the daily activity patterns of the birds."

Here, I tested the hypothesis that red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) are able to recognize alarm calls of a sympatric bird species, the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), and respond adequately with anti-predator behaviour. Both animals are preyed upon by the same predators. To test whether squirrels would react to heterospecific alarm calls, I recorded squirrels behaviour during playbacks of jay alarm calls, control playbacks (territorial songs of sympatric songbirds) and during silence. Differences between the control treatment (songbirds) and silence were not significant. Seven of the 13 squirrels responded with escape after broadcasting alarm calls of jays. Further, squirrels spent less time in the patch, expressed a higher vigilance, and showed more rapid head and body movements. These results suggest that squirrels recognize heterospecific alarm vocalizations of jays and discriminate them from equally loud non-threatening sounds."

It proposes that the persuasive and manipulative effectiveness of introducing questionable contents implicitly can be explained through established cognitive patterns, namely that what is felt by addressees as information coming (also) from them and not (only) from the source of the message is less likely to be challenged. These assumptions are verified by showing examples of implicitness of evidential responsibility (essentially, presuppositions, and topics) as triggers of lesser attention in advertising and propaganda. A possible evolutionary path is sketched for three different pragmatic functions of presuppositions, leading to their availability for manipulation. The distraction effect of presuppositions and topics is also explained in relation with recent developments of Relevance Theory. Behavioral evidence that presuppositions and topics induce low epistemic vigilance and shallow processing is compared to recent neurophysiological evidence which does not confirm this assumption, showing greater processing costs for presuppositions and topics as compared to assertions and foci. A proposal is put forward to reconcile these apparently contrasting data and to explain why they may not be in contrast after all. Also due to natural language quick processing constraints (a Now-or-Never processing Bottleneck), effort devoted to accommodation of presupposed or topicalized new contents may drain resources from concurrent epistemic vigilance and critical evaluation, resulting in shallower processing."

The surface activities of large and small, male and female crabs were video recorded. Afterwards time allocations for various activities (e.g., feeding, standing (vigilance), walking, inside burrows, grooming, burrowing, mating, and for males only, fighting and claw-waving) were calculated. All crabs spent most of their time on feeding than on other activities. Smaller crabs spent more time being vigilant, whereas larger crabs spent more time on courtship displays (grooming, and waving), and fighting. Between sexes, females spent more time standing, but less time on walking and grooming than males. Predation risk, reproductive maturation, breeding/non-breeding season, and energy conservation could be important factors for shaping time allocations in T. rosea."

Understanding how lemurs are affected by degradation of forests in Madagascar is vital to aid in conservation efforts. One mechanism may be that habitat loss limits available food sources, leading to dietary shifts and poorer overall health. I followed several groups of lemurs in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar across a variety of forest types in order to understand how their forest condition affected behaviour and diet. I found that the sifaka spend the most time feeding on seeds in undisturbed forest and young leaves in the disturbed forests. There were few differences in behaviour found between the sites. These results suggest that fewer main food sources, such as large, seed-producing trees, are available in disturbed forests and young leaves are chosen in the absence of these resources. Long-term conservation measures need to focus on including preferred food groups in reforestation plans for lemur consumption. Additionally, the similarity in behaviour may indicate that lemurs in the disturbed areas are recovering and beginning to resemble those in the pristine sites."

We recorded all occurrences of human-primate interactions in 323 15-min samples over 42 consecutive days. We found that capuchins initiated approximately twice as many interactions as humans did (a significant difference). We also found a strong positive correlation between engaging behaviors exhibited by humans and capuchin agonistic behaviors. Capuchins spent significantly more time engaging in moderate behaviors (snatch food, snatch item, vigilance, vocalization) and less time not interacting with humans, in the presence of tourists and staff, than in the presence of staff only. Time spent in moderate and intense behaviors (approach, beg, chase, offer, take food, threat) was lower in 2019 than in 2006 and 2007. These findings suggest that reducing engaging behaviors by humans may reduce primate agonistic behaviors, and that human group composition affects human-primate interactions. The reduction in moderate and intense behaviors between studies also suggests that reducing direct provisioning could reduce the frequency and intensity of human-primate interactions in tourist sites."

Here, our aims were: (a) to investigate the relationships between temperament dimensions obtained through behavioral tests and the social rank of white-eyed parakeets (Psittacara leucophthalmus), and (b) to evaluate the relationships between temperament dimensions with social and non-social behaviors in group-housing captivity. Three temperament tests were applied for each parakeet singly: reaction to an unknown person, novel object, and reaction to potential predator tests. Bird's behaviors during the tests were recorded, generating 13 behavioral variables to which a factor analysis was applied to extract the main dimensions of parakeets' temperament. Social rank was obtained through the observation of aggressive social interactions for animals kept in groups of four individuals, recording the winner and loser of each event. To extract the dominance hierarchy, we used the Elo-rating and David's index of dominance (as higher values are more dominant). Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to investigate the relationships between temperament dimensions with social rank and parakeets' behaviors in group-housing captivity obtained with the two methods. Individual differences in parakeets in three main temperament dimensions were described ('vigilance', `boldness', and 'responsiveness to humans'). David's score was significantly correlated with 'boldness' (r = 0.63), and a trend was found for Elo-rating (r = 0.54). For the 'vigilance' dimension, dominant parakeets based on David's score (r = 0.53) and Elo-rating (r = 0.55) tended to be more vigilant. Temperament was also related to the behavioral categories in group-housing captivity. Bold parakeets spent more time in preening (r = 0.56), had a higher frequency of negative social interactions (r = 0.64), and tended to spend less time interacting with the environment (r = 0.51). Vigilant parakeets had a lower frequency of positive social interactions (r = 0.55) and spent a lower percentage of time in locomotion (r = 0.55). In conclusion, the temperament dimensions obtained for parakeets through behavioral tests were related to their social rank and the behaviors in group-housing captivity. For captive social psittacids, such as those in rescue centers, temperament could prove useful in decisions about choosing individuals to be housed together, because temperament allows inferences about the dominance of the individuals, avoiding unnecessary disputes and injuries inside the aviaries."

We compared the effects of grooming for winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus) on winter foraging behavior by migrating and resident elk (Cervus canadensis) in the partially migratory population at the Ya Ha Tinda, adjacent to Banff National Park, Canada. We used hair loss on the dorsal shoulder area (withers) measured from photographic images as an index of tick infestation of individual elk. We conducted 594 focal observations on 48 radio-collared and 18 uncollared individuals that were uniquely identifiable from ear-tags (N = 66) in 2019 to assess whether grooming for ticks in winter reduced time spent foraging, ruminating, or being vigilant. Because rubbing or hair loss from radio-collars may influence tick infestations and behavior, we controlled for whether elk were collared or uncollared in our analyses. Neck hair loss was 3-5% greater in collared elk than uncollared elk, but neither withers hair loss nor time spent grooming differed. Grooming occurred during 42% of the observations but grooming comprised only similar to 1% of observation time. Nevertheless, 40% of all grooming was observed during resting, and grooming interrupted vigilance behavior similar to 8 times more than foraging. We found no differences among elk following different migratory tactics in time spent grooming or in other behaviors, but one of the two groups of migrant elk had higher withers hair loss. Our results suggest winter ticks may have slight effects on elk relative to other ungulates, particularly moose (Alces alces), in North America."

Attracticide treatments were applied using a calibrated hand pump, and treated plots were compared to similar untreated plots. Male moth activity was monitored using virgin female-baited traps, and the potential for reduction in mating activity was assessed using sentinel virgin females. A comparison of application rates showed that 1500 droplets per ha of the attracticide formulation was as effective as 3000 droplets per ha, and both application rates reduced captures in synthetic pheromone-baited traps for prolonged periods. Droplets placed either at high or low positions within the canopy significantly reduced trap capture and mating with sentinel females. In addition, the only sentinel females that mated in the treated plots were located in the untreated portion of the tree canopy. Mate finding behaviour was equally disrupted by formulations with and without insecticide. Therefore, under the test conditions, the mechanism by which the attracticide formulation worked was by disruption of male orientation, and not by the removal of males due to insecticide poisoning. Two field cage experiments tested the impact of population density on the competitiveness of the attracticide formulation compared to virgin females. A significant proportion of males were captured in female-baited traps at the highest female-to-droplet ratio tested. Equal proportions of males were captured in attracticide-baited traps at male moth densities of 10, 20, 40, and 80 males per cage. These results clarify some of the factors influencing the effectiveness and possible mechanisms of an attracticide management tactic against the Oriental fruit moth."

An average of 83.3% of cubs alive at emergence died by adolescence at 14 months of age, thus cheetah cubs were estimated to have only a 48% chance of reaching independence at birth. The instantaneous rate of mortality was highest immediately after cubs emerged from the lair. Before emergence, lion predation was the major source of this mortality, although some cubs died from starvation after they were abandoned by their mothers, or as a result of grass fires and inclement weather. After emergence, predation again accounted for virtually all cub mortality, with lions and spotted hyaenas taking approximately the same proportion of cubs. Overall predation accounted for 73.2% of cheetah cub deaths in this study, with 78.2% of these being killed by lions. The extent of maternal care, in the form of vigilance and antipredator behaviour, mirrored cub susceptibility to mortality and, in the case of vigilance, possibly also starvation. The probability of a cheetah mother responding aggressively to a predator was found also to depend on the species of predator. This study highlights the importance of the influence of juvenile mortality on patterns of parental care."

Theory predicts an increase in food intake by lactating females, but very few studies have used contraceptives to experimentally test the influence of reproduction on foraging behaviour of wild mammals. From 2009 to 2011, we observed 182 individually marked female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, in two populations, including 29 that received an experimental contraceptive treatment. We sought to determine whether lactating females increase their foraging rate compared to contracepted and naturally nonlactating females. The proportion of time spent foraging during 10 min focal samples did not vary according to reproductive status in one population. In the other, lactating females spent 4% less time feeding than nonlactating females. Day and midday activity and bite and chewing rates were higher in lactating than in nonlactating females. Bite rate increased with the size of the pouch young and was higher for mothers of sons than for mothers of daughters. Bite rate was also affected by reproductive effort in the previous year, being higher for females that had weaned a young. Foraging behaviour was independent of body mass and group size, but bite rate appeared to decrease with female age. In one population, we found strong effects of date and year on foraging behaviour. Our study is a rare experimental manipulation of reproduction in free-ranging large mammals. We found that foraging behaviours were affected by both previous and current reproductive effort and varied with individual characteristics and environmental conditions.

To quantify these benefits, supervise and encourage the adoption of this practice, robust and affordable monitoring indicators of the cover crop dynamic and its biomass are required. This work represents the first attempt to estimate the biomass produced by olive grove cover crops based on remotely sensed data and an adaptation of the Monteith efficiencies approach. Ten olive tree fields were selected, distributed in three zones of Southern Spain. They comprised a high environmental variability and differed in the herbaceous layer management: cover crop in strips; non-tillage without strips (full coverage); and conventional tillage. An adaptation of the LUE (Light Use Efficiency)-model was applied to estimate Net Primary Production (NPP) using meteorological and Sentinel-2 data and subtracting the contribution of the wooded vegetation from the ground spectral response. The results showed an uneven adjustment in different fields. RMSD was equal to 650 kg ha-1, with an MBD of -17 kg ha-1, indicating a moderately high error (around 39%) but not too much bias. This error suggests that the model requires further refining, including the adjustment of model parameters to better represent this agrosystem. However, the evolution of biomass accumulation throughout the cover crop growing season and the behaviour of the daily biomass production provided interesting keys about the cover crops' phenology and management, supporting the discrimination between management practices."

For this reason we examined the locomotor patterns and activity of 41 juvenile European sousliks (Spermophilus citellus) in relation to their individual fates. We investigated whether mortality risk increases with distance from the natal burrow, and we also attempted to distinguish sex-differential locomotor and anti-predator behaviours explaining the female-biased sex ratio among non-juveniles. During three years, weaned juveniles inhabiting a 4 ha plot in a recreation area north of Vienna, Austria, were equipped with radio collars. Nearly 76% of the tagged juveniles were killed by cats or disappeared with unknown fates. Only 5% (two females) permanently departed from their natal area and survived, that is to say, dispersed successfully. Survival of females more than doubled the male percentage and was independent from distance from the natal burrow, whereas most of the surviving males were philopatric. The major finding of this study was that nonsurviving juveniles had moved faster than survivors, with individual speed resulting in sex-differential mortality. Males tended to move faster than females, incurring a greater risk of predation when remote from their natal burrows. Further analyses of behaviour provided evidences that male-biased mortality could arise from sexually different patterns of time allocation to predator avoidance and vigilance. We conclude that among juvenile Spermophilus citellus, males perform an unfavourable trade-off in Surface activity allocated to locomotion and vigilance."

Some bands had up to three adult males, and there was a positive correlation between the number of males and the number of females in bands. Adult males also were seen solitary or formed bachelor groups. One association of three females was observed for 3 months. We noted a correlation between number of females in bands and number of foals per female born during our study (January-July 1992). The advantages of being in larger groups were unclear, because natural predators were rare. Perhaps females in larger groups have more time available for foraging due to reduced individual vigilance or that larger groups live in better-quality home ranges."

We estimated the size of the area used per day and the time budgets of parental and non-parental White-naped Crane pairs in north-eastern Mongolia during 2000 and 2001. Six parental crane pairs used an area Of 11-155 ha per day. The maximum distance of a focal parental crane from the roosting-site was 3,030 m. Habitat conservation measures for breeding White-naped Cranes need to be targeted to within at least 3 km of the roosting-site or nest-site. Parental cranes spent 79.6 +/- 4.8% of the daylight period foraging and had reduced preening and resting behaviour to 4.4 +/- 1.9%. Pairs without juveniles showed a pronounced period of resting and preening behaviour during midday, which was absent in parental cranes. This indicates that parental cranes may be time-stressed. We conclude that increases in feeding-related activities (e.g. caused, by a decrease in food availability) are likely to be at the expense of parental vigilance. Conversely, increases in vigilance (due to e.g. increased disturbance) may have a negative impact on feeding-related activities. Both increases can potentially negatively affect reproductive success in this Vulnerable species."

This rainstorm flooded the city of Pol-e-Dokhtar and many villages. To elucidate and monitor the nature of the spatial extent during and after the flood event, and to evaluate flood-induced ground displacement, the time series Sentinel 1 images were analyzed using threshold and SBAS-InSAR techniques. The SAR images were first calibrated, geometrically corrected, and filtered. Then, the threshold method was applied to draw the map of the affected areas. The results showed that flood spatial propagation varies through time. The nature of spatial extent was sinusoidal, so that the flood behavior complied with precipitation periods. Furthermore, the findings of the SBAS-InSAR indicated how an extreme flood can cause ground displacement. Several active movement areas were identified, showing a surface velocity up to -1.1 mm day(-1) away from the satellite. The field observations demonstrated that the landslide phenomenon occurred in some of these areas. Therefore, the other identified areas can also be at risk of landslides. Finally, based on the findings, it is evident that SAR data can effectively be used for flood water mapping, flood monitoring, and flood-induced ground displacement."

Having both frequent and detailed observations across large geographic areas are ideal characteristics that can potentially revolutionize applications such as crop mapping and monitoring. However, such large volumes of high-resolution data pose challenges to users in terms of problem complexity, computational resources and processing time, beckoning the increasingly relevant question: at which resolution should this imagery be processed? Here, we develop a methodology to characterize resolution-dependent errors in cropland mapping and explore their behavior when we move across spatial scales and landscapes, taking special care to include the effects of the instrument's Point Spread Function (PSF). Results show how local upscaling of 10-m imagery, e.g., from Sentinel-2, to 30 m mitigates most the adverse effects generated by the PSF when comparing it to native 30-m imagery, e.g., from Landsat-8. Extending this logic, we demonstrate for two nationwide cases how maps can be calculated showing the optimal spatial resolution that keeps resolution-dependent errors below a user-defined threshold. Based on these maps, we estimate that 31% of Belgium and 59% of South Africa could be processed at 20 m instead of 10 m, while keeping the increase of resolution-dependent errors below 3%. These local resolution adjustments lead to a reduction in data volume and processing time by 23% and 44%, respectively."

Here, we investigate the existence of such a trade-off by exploring the relative influence of two important behavioural processes, thermoregulation and predation avoidance, on resting behaviour in a cold-adapted mesocarnivore, the wolverine, Gulo gulo. Using animal-borne biologgers, we evaluate the hypothesis that wolverine resting behaviour in both subnivean cavities and on surface snow beds is influenced by a combination of ambient weather conditions and predation risk. Specifically, we posit that although resting on the snow surface is more thermally advantageous in certain weather conditions, it is traded off against heightened predation risk. In support of the importance of thermoregulation, we find that wolverines rest almost exclusively in subnivean cavities at very low temperatures and low levels of solar radiation, and rest almost exclusively on the snow surface at higher temperatures and higher levels of solar radiation. In support of the importance of predation avoidance, we find that wolverines select more topographically concealed sites and are more vigilant while resting on the snow surface. We also find that wolverines are more vigilant at topographically exposed resting sites than at concealed sites. Together, these lines of evidence suggest that wolverines trade security from predators for thermal advantage at warmer ambient temperatures and higher solar radiation levels during winter, but that this trade-off is not necessary at lower temperatures when wolverines preferentially use subnivean cavities to simultaneously meet both demands. Parsing such contextually dependent trade-offs is important to understanding species' habitat selection, energy management and survival. (C) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Thanks to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology and the ability of its backscattered and emitted radiation to penetrate the atmosphere under any conditions, this type of mapping of water surfaces is of particular importance. This paper presents the possibility of using SAR technology for long-term observations of changes in the behaviour of rivers and river systems, combined with optical multispectral images Sentinel-2. Additionally, it aims to demonstrate the suitability of satellite SAR and multispectral data implementation for mapping changes in watercourses, caused not only by their natural development but especially by inundation processes in their catchment area. Appropriate Sentinel-1 image processing evaluation procedures demonstrate that the usage of vertical-vertical (VV) type polarisation configuration is a suitable methodology for documenting water bodies, and a Lee filter is an acceptable tool for radar noise filtering. The extraction process of water surfaces is based on the determination of threshold values using the Otsu principle. Subsequently, the comparison of the results is realised by the spectral indices of water-the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), a pair of Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) indices, and supervised classification method Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). The results are numerical and graphical evaluated. In assessing the accuracy of SAR extraction, the highest values achieved in Overall Accuracy (OA) were a maximum of 98.6%. On average, the lower values were in User Accuracy (UA) with a maximum of 93.1%, where VV polarisation also dominates. However, vertical-horizontal (VH) polarisation dominates in Producer Accuracy (PA) with a maximum of 84.9%."

Therefore, when foraging in heterogeneous landscapes, the costs of predation for optimal foragers should vary along with the environmental features. In our study, we describe how foraging costs of predation vary spatially for Nubian ibex Capra nubiana with respect to characteristics of their natural environment, i.e. we quantified their 'landscape of fear'. To do so, we established a five by five array of feeding trays within the natural environment of free-ranging Nubian ibex and measured the variation of giving-up densities (GUD, i.e. the amount of food remaining in a resource patch following exploitation) in relation to the landscape variables. The ibex' perceptions of risk of predation increased with distance from cliff and slope edges, and decreased with vegetation cover. Although several environmental variables are probably involved in the determination of an animal's foraging behaviour, with our study we revealed the most prominent features influencing the landscape of fear of Nubian ibex. Since Nubian ibex are endangered, this information is relevant for planning their conservation and management."

Most playback studies have demonstrated that similarly sized and taxonomically related species may respond to the calls of each other, but less work has been carried out to define these factors influence responsiveness to alarm signals. In theory, individuals should respond to calls from any species that provide information about the presence of important predators, regardless of body size or taxonomic relationship. However, size is often associated with vulnerability. Coyotes (Canis latrans) in the Rocky Mountains prey upon both mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris), which differ considerably in size, alarm vocalizations, and antipredator behavior. We conducted a playback experiment to see whether deer discriminated between marmot alarm calls and the non-alarm song of a common sympatric bird. We found that deer increased vigilance significantly more after hearing broadcast marmot alarm calls compared with the bird song. Interestingly, deer that were studied within 0.5 km of homes showed significantly greater discrimination than those studied farther from humans. Our results suggest relative size differences do not prevent interspecific communication and that common predators should generally drive the evolution of the ability to learn to respond to meaningful risk cues. As long as two species share a predator, it should benefit the other to respond to its alarm calls."

How Tasmanian prey respond to novel predator cues is of particular interest for their survival and management. Prey response to predator scents may depend on whether predator and prey share an evolutionary history and may be influenced by indirect risk cues such as perceived shelter or safety in the environment. To simultaneously explore the effects of indirect and direct risk cues (predator scent) on free-living Tasmanian pademelons (Thylogale billardierii) and brush tail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), we placed dingo (Canis lupus dingo) urine scents inside and outside a 25 -m2 selective feeding enclosure to mimic a heterogeneous risk landscape. Despite the lack of a historical relationship between dingoes and Tasmanian fauna, pademelons and possums demonstrated flight and vigilance when confronted with the novel scent outside the enclosure. According to our index of deterrence, number of successful entries/approaches, both species were deterred. However, responses inside the safe enclosure differed according to species. For instance, pademelons made more approaches/entries into the enclosure and fled more following approaches to scent marks both inside and outside the enclosure. In comparison, possums only exhibited similar responses outside the enclosure, and there was no effect of stimulus inside the safe compound. Our findings suggest that small animals may be pre-adapted to avoid some predators they have not previously been in contact with, and that brush tail possums are more likely to respond to predation cues when exposed and vulnerable. Ultimately, the cumulative effects of direct and indirect risk cues may either increase or reduce a repellent response."

Shrikes held territories of the same size throughout the year. Visual and vocal signals were used to maintain boundaries. Larger birds maintained larger territories, and were more involved in overt territorial behaviour and vigilance. They also spent less time foraging. Agonistic interactions were displayed on average 2-3 times an hour. Birds from larger territories had more interspecific encounters, while birds from smaller territories had more intraspecific encounters. The number of encounters in each territory was independent of season. Fiscal shrikes were > 90% successful in territorial encounters against both conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Territory size was inversely proportional to perch density and was positively correlated with decreasing precipitation. Fiscal shrikes adapt to human-induced changes, increasing their use of artificial perches when natural perches were less common."

The B-Alert (R) system automatically classifies each second of EEG on an alertness/drowsiness continuum. B-Alert classifications were significantly correlated with technician-observations, visually scored EEG and performance measures. B-Alert classifications during 3C-VT, and technician observations and performance during the 3C-VT and PAL evidenced progressively increasing drowsiness as a result of sleep deprivation with a stabilizing effect observed at the batteries occurring between 0600 and 1 100 suggesting a possible circadian effect similar to those reported in previous sleep deprivation studies. Participants were given an opportunity to take a 40-minute nap approximately 24-hours into the sleep deprivation portion of the study (i.e., 7 PM on Saturday). The nap was followed by a transient period of increased alertness. Approximately 8 hours after the nap, behavioral and physiological measures of drowsiness returned to levels prior to the nap. Cluster analysis was used to stratify individuals into three groups based on their level of impairment as a result of sleep deprivation. The combination of B-Alert and neuro-behavioral measures may identify individuals whose performance is most susceptible to sleep deprivation. These objective measures could be applied in an operational setting to provide a biobehavioral assay to determine vulnerability to sleep deprivation."

Variability was analyzed in terms of proportions of time devoted to various activities, position in vertical space, and dynamic aspects of temporal organization. Adult males spent less time foraging, more time in vigilance, and more time on or near the ground than did other age/sex classes. Juveniles spent more time foraging and less time scanning than adults. Infants moved and socialized more and foraged less than other classes. No class or individual exhibited a clear relationship between the duration of an activity and the interval between bouts of that activity. Females foraged in more bouts per unit time, and in longer bouts, than males; males rested more frequently than females. Sequential patterning of activity, evident in all age/sex classes, varied significantly across ages. Differences between juvenile males and juvenile females in time budgets, use of space, bout and interbout durations, and patterns of transitions were along the same lines as between adult males and females. Similar age and sex differences in vigilance behavior and manipulative activity are evident in other free-ranging populations of capuchins and in captive capuchins, indicating that they are not dependent (in the short term) on the time needed for foraging or the risk of predation.

Our experimental set up comprised three bottomless enclosures, each housing one individual placed on a line at different distances. The birds in the extreme enclosures were labelled senders and the one in the centre receiver. We manipulated the foraging opportunities of senders (enhanced, natural, no-foraging), and recorded the behaviour of the receiver. In the first experiment, receivers responded to the condition of senders. Their searching rate and food intake increased when senders foraged in enhanced conditions, and decreased in no-foraging conditions, in relation to natural conditions. Scanning was oriented more in the direction of conspecifics when senders' behaviour departed from normal. In the second experiment, responses were dose dependent: receivers increased their searching rate and orientated their gaze more towards conspecifics with the number of senders foraging in enhanced food conditions. In no-foraging conditions, receivers decreased their searching and intake rates with the number of senders, but no variation was found in scanning towards conspecifics. Differences in foraging and scanning behaviour between enhanced and no-foraging conditions were much lower when neighbours were separated farther. Overall, information transfer within starling flocks affects individual foraging and scanning behaviour, with receivers monitoring and copying senders' behaviour mainly when neighbours are close. Information transfer may be related to predation information (responding to the vigilance of conspecifics) and foraging information (responding to the feeding success of conspecifics). Both sources of information, balanced by neighbour distance, may simultaneously affect the behaviour of individuals in natural conditions."

Increasing visitation, however, can compromise ecological integrity. A fundamental conundrum is that if parks are to serve as our most pristine places, then we must understand how human presence alters biological interactions. Species that redistribute themselves closer to people is of growing management concern both in and out of national parks because of 1) human safety, 2) animal health, and 3) ecological consequences. Drivers of distributional change are often dissimilar but may include increased association with people for predator avoidance - the human shield hypothesis. We examine redistribution patterns with comparative, observational, and experimental approaches contrasting ecological responses of an iconic species in an USA national park - Glacier. Specifically, we focused on the role of predator-avoidance and resource enhancement to test whether a cold-adapted alpine obligate, mountain goats, (Oreamnos americanus), mediate their distribution by increasing spatial overlap with humans. Individuals that enhanced mineral acquisition through access to human urine concomitantly reduced behavioral and ecological responses to grizzly bear (Ursus arctos hornbilis) experiments. Goats near people also displayed reduced group sizes, vigilance, use of escape terrain, and forfeited migrations to naturally occurring minerals. Our findings re-enforce the increasing complexities of natural area management because visitation is altering ecological interactions. While protected areas offer some forms of baselines for scientists and enjoyment for millions of visitors, redistribution of species and associated ecological changes signifies that additional care will be needed in what we perceive as pristine and what is anthropogenically-altered."
"Fernandez, Guillermo; Lank, David B.",Do sex and habitat differences in antipredator behavior of Western Sandpipers Calidris mauri reflect cumulative or compensatory processes?,JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY,151,665,672,10.1007/s10336-010-0507-y,2010,"Individuals manage their risk of predation in different ways in different situations. We studied the use of anti-predator behavior by Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) at Bahia Santa Maria, northwestern Mexico, foraging in three habitats that differed in presumed predation danger. Brackish flats are completely open, making them theoretically less dangerous for feeding sandpipers than mangroves and cattail marshes, which have closer visual horizons. Western Sandpipers are sexually dimorphic, with females about 15% longer-billed and 10% heavier than males. We previously showed that male and female sandpipers differed in their habitat choice and relative body mass in ways consistent with differential responses to predation danger (Fernandez and Lank in Condor 108:547-557, 2006). Contrary to expectations, however, females were overrepresented in more dangerous habitats. Here, we examine differential usage across habitats and between the sexes of three anti-predator tactics-flock size, density within flocks, and vigilance rate-that may be used cumulatively to reinforce safety, or as trade-offs that compensate for levels of usage of each. We hypothesized, and found, that ordered differences occur among habitats, and that controlling for other factors, females were more cautious than males. For the most part, the use of these three tactics appeared to be cumulative, rather than compensatory. However, with respect to habitat use, birds appeared to compensate for the higher probability of mortality intrinsic to the use of higher-danger habitats by increasing the use of vigilance, foraging in tighter flocks, and maintaining lighter body weights (females only). Thus, both cumulative and compensatory processes operate among anti-predator tactics to determine the net level of safety and trade-off against other factors."

The Current research examines the relationship between men's and women's mate values and men's use of partner-directed insults-a specific type of cost-inflicting mate retention behavior One hundred fifty-eight women provided information about their own Mate Value, their partner's mate value, and their partner's verbal insults. The results indicate that although men's and women's mate values independently predict men's partner-directed insults, men's mate value is a better predictor than is women's mate value. Women who report that their partners have lower mate value also report that their partners insult them more frequently than women who report that their partners have higher mate value.

Marmosets are highly motivated to forage for animal prey, as demonstrated by the amount of time spent foraging for insects and small vertebrates even in the presence of provisioned, high-quality food Like their wild congeners, the marmosets engaged in prolonged visual searches of selected areas while slowly locomoting. They seldom used their hands to manipulate substrates. The marmosets were startled proportionately more often while foraging for animal prey than would be predicted by their overall time budgets, and they regularly, if briefly, interrupted their search/locomote pattern with sweeping scans of the surroundings that may contribute to a vigilance function. While carrying infants, they almost never foraged These results are consistent with the notion that marmosets may be particularly vulnerable to predation while searching for animal prey. Most of the data on marmoset and tamarin feeding ecology have focused on fruits and gums. My data underscore the need to understand better the role of animal prey in the behavioral ecology of callitrichids."

Observations of young southern hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) that were still with their mothers revealed that they have an extensive ethogram that includes autonomous and social play, and precocial aggressive and defensive behaviours. The behaviour of one wombat was observed for 5-7 nights at monthly intervals from when it was first seen above ground with its mother (at an estimated age of 7-9 months). In the first 3 months it played often, and it remained within 25mof the natal burrow. Thereafter, the frequency of play declined, and it followed its mother further from the natal burrow. Five months after it was first seen it became independent of its mother when she moved to another warren. Nearly all the young wombat's social encounters and interactions were with the group of wombats that occupied two warrens that included the natal burrow. At the time of the study, in 1975, only two of the nine juvenile and subadult wombats that were present at the warrens when the study started were still there 15 months later, which suggests that many young wombats disperse."

Group formation in eiders Somateria mollissima in response to hunting from motorboats was studied in the Danish Wadden Sea as an avoidance strategy to humans. In autumn the birds' food demand and energy consumption are relatively low and the need for optimal feeding opportunities are not as essential as during winter. We tested the hypothesis that eiders aggregate in groups of variable size dependent on predation risk (hunting), season and site. During autumn at the preferred feeding sites eiders occur in small numbers and group size increase together with hunting activity. Opposite during winter, eiders occur in large numbers and group size decrease when hunting activity increase. Hunting activity displaced eiders to adjacent sites with no or low hunting intensity and low food availability where group size of eiders increase during both autumn and winter in relation to the overall hunting activity. The formation into larger groups when hunting activity increase is probably due to increasing effects of vigilance and dilution, whereas formation into smaller groups is assumed to reduce the eiders conspicuousness to hunters. This change in group size made it possible for eiders to forage in areas with high food availability and high hunting intensity, while minimizing the risk of being detected by hunters. When the largest numbers of hunters were present at the preferred feeding site, group sizes during both autumn and winter were 110-125 eiders, indicating an optimal group size in relation to hunting density. Eiders located outside preferred feeding sites were in poorer body condition, suggesting that displacement was a suboptimal decision caused by hunting. We conclude that eiders adopted regrouping and displacement as two different strategies during hunting. Both strategies are tradeoffs between the risks of being detected by hunters and killed, and the benefits of feeding on mussel stocks thereby increasing body condition and hence fitness."

Little is known about its diet in the breeding season, especially while birds feed on the ground. Analysis of crop contents indicated that willow (Salix spp.) was the primary food of males (>98% wet weight, n = 4), whereas Dragon spruce (Picea asperata) seeds and willow were the primary foods of females (both >40% wet weight, n = 2). Dragon spruce seeds, invertebrates (mainly ants), and forbs were frequently consumed by females, but seldom by males, possibly to meet the nutrient constraints of egg formation. We suggest the different diets of males and females of this monogamous species may be the result of females allocating more time to searching for scarce, nutritious food, whereas males spend more time in vigilance behavior.

"Beauchamp, Guy",Parental behaviour and brood integrity in amalgamated broods of the Common Eider,Wildfowl,51,169,179,,2000,"Post-hatch brood amalgamation was examined in the Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) along the shorelines of the St. Lawrence estuary, Quebec, Canada. Broods typically contained a large number of ducklings and several females in attendance. The amount of time allocated to foraging, vigilance, and other activities by brooding females failed to vary as a function of the number of ducklings. In addition, abandoned ducklings were readily adopted by brooding females suggesting that parental care is not constrained by the presence of additional ducklings. Parental behaviour also varied little in response to the presence of additional females. Preening on shore, however, increased in frequency with the number of females perhaps because broods aggregated more often in safer sites. Losses of ducklings occurred in several broods in one of three ways: (1) when ducklings straggled behind during foraging activities, (2) when broods aggregated temporarily and more rarely (3) when females voluntarily abandoned ducklings. Such losses suggest that integrity may be difficult to maintain in amalgamated broods. The extent to which lost ducklings are predisposed to be abandoned as a result of sickness or severe malnutrition, for instance, remains to be investigated."

So far, the predictions of the confusion effect have been tested mainly in aquatic predators. As the confusion effect is seen to be a general problem for predators, terrestrial predators of two different vertebrate classes were used to test it. The prey (mealworms and black beetles, Tenebrio molitor) was harmless and had no chance of predator avoidance. Thus, confounding effects of group defence and enhanced vigilance were controlled. Both leopard geckos (Eublepharis macularius) and common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) took longer to catch one out of several prey compared to one single prey. Leopard geckos showed more fixations (changing of head position) when confronted with 20 mealworms than when confronted with only one mealworm, thus showing indications of being 'confused'."
"FERNS, PN; HINSLEY, SA",EFFECTS OF RAPTORS ON THE ACTIVITY OF SANDGROUSE,JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH,28,236,241,,1994,"Raptors accounted for 55% of the disturbance incurred by two species of sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata and P. orientalis) in breeding habitat in La Mancha, Spain, during spring and summer. The main species of raptors were the golden eagle (Aguila chrysaetos) in spring and Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) in summer. During the breeding season, Montagu's harriers carried out the majority of their foraging at those times of day when male sandgrouse collected water for their chicks. This presumably enabled the harriers to locate chicks more easily. Sandgrouse lost no more than 0.5 hr of feeding time per day as a result of disturbance by raptors, and yet were still able to rest for at least 3 hr a day at times when they could have been feeding. Predators as a whole were probably the major factor responsible for the different dispersion patterns adopted by sandgrouse at different times of year."

Prey exploited by predators engaged in a PS game could gain by evolving predator evasion tactics that shift the PS equilibrium of their predators towards a larger number of nonsearching scroungers. Prey can achieve this by imposing foraging costs that are specific to predators engaged in the producer strategy. Ye tested whether prey crypsis, a trait that has evolved as a demonstrably efficient strategy against solitary predators, imposed a producer-specific cost to group foragers that shifts PS equilibria towards more scrounging. We exposed four flocks of six nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata, small granivorous passerines that have been documented to play PS foraging games, to clumps of white millet seeds placed against one of two backgrounds that made them either cryptic or conspicuous. In three of four flocks, foraging under crytic conditions required more time to find food, resulted in more detection errors, had no effect on vigilance but significantly increased the frequency of scroungers at equilibrium. Having socially foraging predators may provide prey with an extra incentive to evolve producer-specific costs such as cryptic coloration."

VAN SCHAIK C P; VAN NOORDWIJK M A,THE SPECIAL ROLE OF MALE CEBUS MONKEYS IN PREDATION AVOIDANCE AND ITS EFFECT ON GROUP COMPOSITION,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,24,265,276,,1989,"Vigilance behavior, predator detection abilities, and responses of real and model predators were studied in two species of capuchin monkeys (Cebus albifrons and C. apella) in a Peruvian lowland rain forest. Adult males were more vigilant than adult females in both species, mainly because the males spent less time feeding and foraging and partly because they were at the periphery more often than the females. The increased vigiliance of adult males is reflected in their superior performance in the detection of (model) predators. Adult and subadult males were also far more likely to approach and mob real and model predators. Adults that were outside the center of the group increased foraging activities but cut back an feeding, much of which was done in exposed tree corwns. Current theory suggests that primate groups are multi-male when a single male is unable to defend sexual access to the group of females. In these small capuchin groups, which are multi-provided by extra adult males furnishes a more plausible explanation. A comparison of the two capuchins with the ecologically similar southeast Asian Acaca fascicularis suggests that the high predation risk outside the group may also have caused the unusual male career profile in capuchins, which have a long tenure of dominants and a very long potential lifespan. Further predictions of this hypothesis are developed."

We subjected chipmunks, foraging at artificial feeding stations, to three playback treatments (silent, control noise, and alarm call) and examined changes in vigilant and foraging behavior. Chipmunks responded to alarm calls with a greater degree and duration of vigilant behavior, such as look-ups and alert postures. Chipmunks also ran a shorter distance to cover and took longer to re-emerge from the burrow after hearing an alarm call. Alarm calls caused individuals to spend more time exposed at the feeding stations; however, individuals also took significantly fewer seeds after hearing an alarm call. This was not due to a difference in the time spent handling food, but rather to a slower rate of loading. Chipmunks appear to sacrifice energy gain by increasing vigilance after hearing an alarm call. This study suggests that to avoid the costs of unnecessary escape behavior, individuals directly assess their own risk rather than relying only on indirect cues such as alarm calls."
"Bregnballe, Thomas; Madsen, Jesper",Post-hatching behaviour of Light-bellied Brent Geese Branta bernicla hrota,Wildfowl,41,27,34,,1990,"Time budgets, spacing and antipredator behaviour of Light-bellied Brents were studied on an island in southeast Svalbard during the first three weeks of post-hatching. Male parents spent equal amounts of time on feeding and vigilance (33%), whereas females grazed more (46%) than they were vigilant (16%). For all geese more resting took place at night than around midday. Vigilance in the head up posture was less frequent during night than during day. At the time of loss of remiges non-breeder feeding activity declined from 60% to 35%; they flocked and began to follow families, even though attacked by male parents. Ken parents began moulting their remiges they became more gregarious and more tolerant towards non-breeders. Short distances between family members and between families, a high frequency of alert behaviour and effective antipredator responses including collective protection are suggested to account for the survival of all 90 goslings in the study area. We discuss how changes in the risk of predation of goslings and adults influence the extent of flocking."

Like other birds, these swans have the ability to close down one brain hemisphere at a time during rest, which is indicated by eye closure. We quantified rates of closure of eyes during sleeping bouts for both breeding and non-breeding swans. Single eye closure varied in frequency, duration and in terms of which hemisphere was shut down. Increasing duration of eye closure over time indicated an increased sense of security with surrounding in one mated pair. Proportion of time with both eyes closed during sleep differed significantly between breeding and non-breeding swans, which may reflect security related to social status. Unlike ducks, which peek during sleeping, Trumpeters raised their head briefly during sleep bouts, likely in response to auditory stimuli. Both peeking (precautionary vigilance) and head up behaviour (reactionary vigilance) are adaptations to predation risk. There is much still to be learned about sleep behaviour in swans and other birds."

We collected behavioural observations during scan sampling sessions on marked individuals at two study sites with different environmental characteristics. We used Bayesian hierarchical multinomial regression models to analyse the influence of both intrinsic (sex and age-dominance status) and extrinsic (environmental and climatic variables) factors on the above-ground activity budget. Marmots spent most of their time above ground foraging, and were more likely to forage when it was cloudy. Extrinsic factors such as the site, period of the season (June, July-August, and August-September), and time of the day were all related to the probability of engaging in vigilance behaviour, which reaches its peak in early morning and late afternoon and during July, the second period included in the study. Social behaviours, such as affiliative and agonistic behaviours, were associated mostly with sex and age-dominance status, and yearlings were the more affiliative individuals compared to other status. Overall, our results suggest that in alpine marmots, intrinsic factors mostly regulate agonistic and affiliative behaviours, while extrinsic factors, with the unexpected exception of temperature, affect the probabilities of engaging in all types of behavioural categories."

Groups usually remained stable within the breeding season. Sampling revealed that all adult members exhibited behavioral efforts in terms of brooding, vigilance, and territorial display (including calling and fighting), with helpers especially focusing on territorial fighting. No evidence was found to suggest that the presence of helpers significantly enhanced a group's breeding success and productivity compared to unaided pairs. Further studies, particularly intraspecific comparative analyses (for example, between populations or between sites) and those measuring the relatedness between helpers and other group members, are needed to understand the occurrence of cooperative breeding in this species."

These gaps in the definition of the term safety demand greater attention to how being safe and feeling safe are interpreted by individuals who live and engage in sexual lives marked by social and political inequality. In the current study, we draw on interviews with 17 young women ages 18-28 from a U.S. urban university to examine efforts they used to protect themselves in sexual relationships. When having sex with men, we found young women relied on a range of efforts to keep themselves safe, such as controlling their own sexual desire, developing strict contraceptive regimens, and building relational contexts characterized by physical and emotional safety. We argue that sexual safety labor (i.e., good contraceptive behavior, waiting to have sex, and careful decision-making) offers evidence of what safe sex requires of young women. We examine this range of cognitions and behaviors as forms of labor directed at making sex feel and be safe; however, young women did not describe these efforts in terms of their own time or energy. In our analysis, we suggest that vigilance in sexual relationships has become part of young women's required repertoire of safe sex behaviors, but largely goes unnoticed by them. We connect these findings with public health campaigns that teach young people about safety and offer alternatives for researchers looking to understand and study what is imagined as safe sex."

Accordingly, modafinil may provide a safe and effective alternative to the more commonly used amphetaminic class of stimulants, for example, in clinical settings to treat sleep disorders (e.g., idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy) and sustained military operations to promote vigilance during periods of prolonged sleep deprivation. In this article, we investigate the relative effects of three doses of modafinil on fatigue and cognitive performance in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 64-hr sleep-deprivation study. We observe a dose-related ordering on subjective measures of fatigue, motivation, subjective performance, and alertness following 4 min with eyes closed and on objective measures of serial reaction time, complex mental addition, and short-term memory. Specifically, 300 mg of modafinil in a 24-hr period (100 mg every 8 hr) was found to maintain cognitive performance at or near baseline levels throughout the sleep-deprivation period, 150 mg of modafinil in a 24-hr period (50 mg every 8 hr) provided some maintenance of performance, and 50 mg of modafinil in a 24-hr period (16.7 mg every 8 hr) was not substantively different from placebo. In addition, subjective reports made by the participants during weekly debriefings revealed no evidence of intolerance at any drug dose. Accordingly, these findings permit a specification of the minimum dose of modafinil required for the safe and effective amelioration of cognitive performance decrements induced by a period of prolonged sleep deprivation."

Custom fuel models were created for each dominant species (Pinus sylvestris, Fagus sylvatica, and Quercus rubra). Canopy cover, canopy height, and crown base height were directly derived from airborne LiDAR point clouds. Surface fuel types and crown bulk density (CBD) were predicted using random forest and ridge regression, respectively. Modeling was supported by 119 predictors extracted from LiDAR, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 data. We simulated fire spread from random ignitions, considering eight environmental scenarios to calculate fire behavior and hazard. Fuel type classification scored an overall accuracy of 0.971 (Kappa = 0.967), whereas CBD regression performed notably weaker (RMSE = 0.069; R-2 = 0.73). Higher fire hazard was identified for strong winds, low fuel moisture, and on slopes. Fires burned fastest and most frequently on slopes in large homogeneous pine stands. These should be the focus of preventive management actions."

Its historic range has been reduced during the past 200 years mostly due to agricultural practices and related disturbance. Currently, urbanization is one of the biggest threats to colonies of prairie clogs in eastern New Mexico. As cities expand, colonies contract and become increasingly fragmented. Impacts of broad-scale landscape factors and disturbance by humans on behavior of black-tailed prairie dogs are unknown. To address these impacts, we chose two landscapes in eastern New Mexico, urban and rural. In spring 2006 and autumn winter 2006-2007, we randomly selected six sites within each type of landscape and conducted 20 5-min behavioral observations at each site. We compared behavioral time budgets using the Mann-Whitney mu-test. Black-tailed prairie dogs spent significantly more time being vigilant and gave more warning calls in urban areas, but they spent significantly more time foraging in rural areas. These results suggest that prairie clogs respond behaviorally to differences in type of landscape. Costs associated with higher levels of vigilance might translate as lower overall fitness due to decreased foraging in these populations. Landscape-level factors should be considered in future management decisions for this species."
"Green-Barber, Jai M.; Old, Julie M.",Is camera trap videography suitable for assessing activity patterns in eastern grey kangaroos?,Pacific Conservation Biology,24,134,141,10.1071/PC17051,2018,"Camera traps are frequently used in wildlife research and may be a useful tool for monitoring behavioural patterns. The suitability of camera traps to monitor behaviour depends on the size, locomotion, and behaviour of the species being investigated. The suitability of cameras for documenting the behaviour of eastern grey kangaroos was assessed here by comparing activity patterns collected using cameras to published activity patterns for the species. The activity patterns calculated from camera trap data were largely consistent with data from previous studies, although nocturnal activity appeared to be under-represented. Observations of unusual fighting behaviour illustrates the potential for camera traps to enable capture of novel observations. Kangaroo behaviour appeared to be influenced by the presence of cameras; however, no kangaroos retreated from cameras. Data suggested that kangaroos became habituated to cameras after eight months. The findings of this study suggest that camera traps are suitable for assessing the diurnal activity of eastern grey kangaroos and arc useful tools for documenting their behaviour."

Various behavioural patterns were identified and the time spent on each activity was noted. All three types of subjects (viz.: breeding male, brooding/incubating female and young) showed different behavioural characteristics. In the breeding female, high intensity activities were incubation, brooding, vigilance and out of sight (construed to be out hunting) and low intensity activities comprised comfort movements, feeding, pellet regurgitation, feeding young, prey delivery and disturbed at the nest. In the young, high intensity activities were resting and moving, while low intensity activities were feeding, pellet regurgitation and wing flapping. In the male, the bulk of time was spent in vigilance and the other high intensity activity was out of sight (construed to be hunting). Low intensity activities included comfort movements and prey delivery. The male hunted more than the female. Forty-five prey items were delivered by the two parents and these items were identified to the species or generic level."
"LOUGHRY, WJ",MECHANISMS OF CHANGE IN THE ONTOGENY OF BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE DOG TIME BUDGETS,ETHOLOGY,95,54,64,,1993,"This study examines the behavioral mechanisms underlying changes in the time allocation patterns of black-tailed prairie dog (Sciuridae: Cynomys ludovicianus) pups. Previous analyses of time budgets had revealed substantial differences between pups (young of the year) and adults, and that pup time budgets changed significantly over time. This paper shows that these differences were due to two mechanisms: pups generally differed from adults in the frequency of performance of different behaviors; however, changes in pup behavior over time were due to changes in both bout frequencies and durations. Other influences on bout durations were also examined. Time of day dramatically affected the duration of most behaviors, with vigilance bouts longest in the morning and feeding bouts longest in the evening. The presence of a pup's mother above ground and the height of the vegetation a pup was in had much less influence on bout durations. Multiple regression analyses were used to identify other potential influences (e.g., weather and social conditions) on bout lengths. Of these, the distance of a pup from the nearest burrow produced the strongest relationships."

Natural enemies may provide significant suppression of the brown marmorated stink bug, and sentinel egg masses are deployed commonly on plants in the field to measure their effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of deployment duration (2-5 d) on parasitism and predation of brown marmorated stink bug sentinel egg masses in plum, peach, blueberry, tomato, sassafras, corn, and soybean in these 2 states. Retrieved egg masses were processed to quantify rates of predation and parasitism and identify parasitoid species and predation types. Across crops, predation and parasitism were higher significantly in plum at 5 d compared to 2 d deployment but was similar in soybean regardless of exposure time in 2017. Predation and parasitism were higher significantly after 5 d of exposure compared to 2 d and 3 d whereas parasitism was significantly higher at 3 d compared to 2 d exposure in 2018 to 2020. For individual crop trials, though, effects of time of exposure were tested in different yr, sampling dates, and crops with variable results. When significant differences were detected for parasitism in plum, peach, tomato, and sassafras, a 5 d deployment resulted in higher parasitism compared to 2 d. Given the variability of factors that affect parasitism and predation under field conditions, we conclude that a 5 d deployment is optimal and a 3 d exposure time is minimal for assessing predation and parasitism. An additional benefit for a 5 d exposure is that it increases the probability of detecting hyperparasitism."

The February 12, 2017, landslide was triggered by the combined effects of intense rainfalls and snowmelt that saturated the slope. The SqueeSAR algorithm was applied to two C-band SAR datasets, composed by Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 images, spanning a nine-year time interval before the landslide occurrence. Moreover, the amplitude information carried by two TerraSAR-X images, acquired immediately before and after the event, was exploited to derive the total displacement generated by the landslide movement by means of the RMT (rapid motion tracking) algorithm. The obtained results allow describing the landslide behavior before and after its failure. In particular, the back-monitoring analysis shows that the landslide was already slowly moving, with deformation rates increasing from the Radarsat-2 to the Sentinel-1 monitored periods, 10 years before its complete mobilization. The landslide failure of February 2017 produced maximum displacements of about 10 m in some sectors of the affected area. The registered deformation rates and the localization of the maximum displacements areas were confirmed by field data, collected during a field campaign and a helicopter recognizance of the damaged areas, both performed after the event."
"Wood, Kevin A.; Newth, Julia L.; Hilton, Geoff M.; Rees, Eileen C.",Behavioural and energetic consequences of competition among three overwintering swan (Cygnus spp.) species,AVIAN RESEARCH,12,,,10.1186/s40657-021-00282-5,2021,"Background Winter numbers of the northwest European population of Bewick's Swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) declined recently by c. 40%. During the same period, numbers of two sympatric and ecologically-similar congeners, the Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) and Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus) showed increases or stability. It has been suggested that these opposing population trends could have a causal relationship, as Mute and Whooper Swans are larger and competitively dominant to Bewick's Swans in foraging situations. If so, effects of competition of Mute and Whooper Swans on Bewick's Swans should be detectable as measurable impacts on behaviour and energetics. Methods Here, we studied the diurnal behaviour and energetics of 1083 focal adults and first-winter juveniles (cygnets) of the three swan species on their winter grounds in eastern England. We analysed video recordings to derive time-activity budgets and these, together with estimates of energy gain and expenditure, were analysed to determine whether individual Bewick's Swans altered the time spent on key behaviours when sharing feeding habitat with other swan species, and any consequences for their energy expenditure and net energy gain. Results All three swan species spent a small proportion of their total time (0.011) on aggressive interactions, and these were predominantly intraspecific (>= 0.714). Mixed-effects models indicated that sharing feeding habitat with higher densities of Mute and Whooper Swans increased the likelihood of engaging in aggression for cygnet Bewick's Swans, but not for adults. Higher levels of interspecific competition decreased the time spent by Bewick's Swan cygnets on foraging, whilst adults showed the opposite pattern. When among low densities of conspecifics (< c. 200 individuals/km(2)), individual Bewick's Swans spent more time on vigilance in the presence of higher densities of Mute and Whooper Swans, whilst individuals within higher density Bewick's Swan flocks showed the opposite pattern. Crucially, we found no evidence that greater numbers of interspecific competitors affected the net energy gain of either adult or cygnet Bewick's Swans. Conclusions We found no evidence that Bewick's Swan net energy gain was affected by sharing agricultural feeding habitat with larger congeners during winter. This was despite some impacts on the aggression, foraging and vigilance behaviours of Bewick's Swans, especially among cygnets. It is unlikely therefore that competition between Bewick's Swans and either Mute or Whooper Swans at arable sites in winter has contributed to the observed decline in Bewick's Swan numbers. Further research is needed, however, to test for competition in other parts of the flyway, including migratory stopover sites and breeding areas."

Proximate factors (behavioural variety, persistence, selectivity and experience) provide behavioural mechanisms that also affect problem-solving performance. Our aim was to assess the link between personality and problem-solving performance in wild-caught, common brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula, and to assess their learning capability. We tested how possums, a native marsupial inhabiting the inner urban environment of Sydney, Australia, solved an escape box problem in the field. Possums could solve this problem by either pushing (easy) or pulling (difficult) a door. We quantified personality traits, including exploration, activity and vigilance, in a separate arena test. We found that personality traits affected problem solving. Exploratory animals were more likely to succeed in their first trial irrespective of task type, but only highly exploratory individuals were likely to solve the difficult task. More active and more vigilant individuals were also more likely to succeed, regardless of task type. For mechanistic behaviours employed during the problem-solving test, individuals spending more time engaged (persistent) were less likely to succeed in the easy task, because they focused more on nonfunctional parts of the box. In contrast, persistent individuals were more likely to succeed in the difficult task. Possums learnt effectively, solving tasks substantially faster on their second attempt. Our study provides the first demonstration of problem solving in free-ranging marsupials using an ecologically relevant test. This allows future comparison of behavioural commonalities and tests of convergent evolution in problem solving among taxa. Furthermore, while personality traits influenced problem-solving capability, we suggest that the rapid improvement in problem solving by all possums through experience and learning helps explain their success in dealing with artificial or novel problems associated with the urban environment.

"Hogstad, Olav",Are wintering Common Redpolls Carduelis flammea more exposed to avian predators than other small passerines?,Ornis Norvegica,40,45,48,10.15845/on.v40i0.1359,2017,"The Common Redpoll Carduelis flammea is a highly social flocking bird which forms cohesive groups outside the breeding season. Being small birds (12-15g), they need to forage almost continuously during a few hours of daylight in winter to meet their energy demands. Although predation risk is reduced as a result of improved surveillance of many eyes, increased flock size may also increase the agonistic interactions among individuals within the flock and as a consequence lower the probability of detection of a predator's approach. To examine whether Common Redpolls, living in relatively large winter flocks, are more exposed to avian predators than small passerines living in groups of only a few individuals, I recorded the responses of Common Redpolls, Willow Tits Poecile montanus and Great Tits Parus major to a life-like stuffed specimen of two different predators, the Siberian Jay Perisoreus infaustus (body length 30 cm) and the Hooded Crow Corvus cornix (50 cm). After the presentation of a predator model, Redpolls returned to the seed sites on the average earlier than the tits, and significantly so versus both tit species after exposure to the Siberian Jay, and for Great Tits after exposure to the Hooded Crow. Whereas Willow and Great Tits seemed to pick up sunflower seeds in the snow without much competition, Common Redpolls displayed a more conspicuous, aggressive, intraspecific behaviour. Thus, the individual vigilance of Common Redpolls was most likely reduced and exposure time to predation increased. The seed-eating Common Redpolls may be more food-stressed than the year-round resident Willow Tits that have stored food within their territories. If so, Common Redpolls may be forced to take greater predation risks because of a higher hunger level. If the differences in return times after exposure to a predator model reflected an adaptation to perceived predation risk, the Common Redpolls apparently evaluated the Siberian Jay as less dangerous than did the tits."

The European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is one such species where it has been introduced in Australia. A novel but unexplored tactic to reduce the impact of mammalian predators is the use of unrewarded prey odors to undermine the effectiveness of olfactory hunting behavior. To test the viability of unrewarded prey odors in an applied setting we investigated how foxes responded to the odors of three different prey species. We used the odors of two locally extinct native Australian marsupials; the eastern quoll (a smaller carnivore) and eastern bettong (a fungivore), and the European rabbit, an introduced herbivore. Conducting our research over a period of 3 weeks in a pastoral environment in South-eastern Australia, we used video observations of foxes' behaviors, as they encountered the different odors. We found a reduction in the number of fox visits to bettong odors in the third week. In contrast, we observed a sustained number of visits to rabbit odors. Foxes also spent more time investigating rabbit odors and displayed longer durations of vigilance behavior at quoll odors. Our results support the hypothesis that the exposure of wild foxes to unrewarded odors of novel prey species can reduce their interest in these odors, which might translate to a reduction in predation pressure. Our results also suggest, however, that olfactory pre-exposure may not be as effective at reducing fox interest in a competitor species' odor."

These interactions are usually asymmetrical as larger predators dominate in aggressive encounters. Smaller predators are forced to balance the conflicting demands of obtaining food while reducing the risk of a confrontation. We tested the behavioural responses of 16 wild captured stoats (Mustela erminea) to the presence of a feral cat (Felis catus) and a ferret (Mustela furo), which we refer to as larger predators due to their superior body size. Stoats were released individually into an outdoor arena and nocturnal activities were recorded on infra-red video cameras. On treatment nights, one of the larger predators was placed inside a segregated holding cage on one side of the arena, while an empty cage was placed on the opposite side as a control. A stoat's daily food allocation was divided into two equal portions, one placed in front of each holding cage to form a food patch. Stoats' perception of risk was assessed by comparing behaviour in the risky patch (close to the caged predator) versus the safe patch (close to the empty cage). Stoats harvested less food at the risky patch. They avoided the area containing the larger predator, both spatially and temporally, and increased vigilance at the risky patch. The results show that stoats alter their foraging behaviour due to perceived interference competition when they encounter larger predators. Understanding trophic interactions between invasive species will help to inform conservation decisions and maximise the effectiveness of management intervention."

This risk is governed by exposure to predators and vulnerability following encounters. Behavioural responses to reduce risks have ramifying consequences for habitat partitioning, regional distributions and local impacts of herbivores on vegetation. These consequences are reviewed for carnivore-ungulate assemblages in African savanna ecosystems. Vigilance serves multiple functions, including locating food and maintaining group cohesion as well as detecting predators. Prey responses depend on whether predators hunt by ambush or pursuit and whether they are mainly diurnally or nocturnally active. Ungulates can lower their vulnerability by restricting time spent foraging at night and avoid places providing cover for lurking carnivores. Risks of predation can have a stronger influence on spatial partitioning among large grazers than distinctions in resource use. Only species above some threshold size have distributions indifferent to tree and grass cover. Observed mortality rates are constrained by recruitment potential. Spatiotemporal variation in risk may regulate populations and limit regional abundance. Herbivores confined to secure habitat may generate local brown-green-black world mosaics. Less common prey species of greatest conservation concern are most susceptible to having their habitat security breached by changes in predation risk. Studies establishing baseline responses of ungulates to the risk of predation need to be augmented by investigations focussed on extreme situations."
"ALONSO, JC; ALONSO, JA",DAILY ACTIVITY AND INTAKE RATE PATTERNS OF WINTERING COMMON CRANES GRUS-GRUS,ARDEA,80,343,351,,1992,"Daily activity patterns of wintering Common Cranes Grus grus were studied at Gallocanta, NE Spain, and related with changes in foraging site, distance to roost and flocking behaviour. Per cent time spent feeding, feeding bout length, and food intake rate showed two peaks, in early morning and late afternoon. Vigilance, preening and other activities followed an inverse pattern, peaking at midday, when birds usually gathered at drinking sites. The feeding habitat and location, and the flock size changed between the morning and the evening foraging peaks. During the morning cranes showed a higher locomotor activity, foraging in smaller flocks, at higher distances from the roost, and on grounds with higher food availability. On the contrary, during the afternoon birds showed lower locomotor activity, aggregated in larger flocks, and foraged closer to the roost, on grounds with lower food availability. We explain these daily changes as a consequence of the risk-sensitive foraging behaviour of the cranes. Birds shifted from a risk-prone foraging with higher intake rate in the morning to a risk-averse one with lower intake rate in the evening."

Automated image analysis however often relies on extensive datasets, not implementable by small research teams. We are here proposing an object detection method that allows the analysis of high-resolution images containing many animals interacting in a small dataset. We developed an image analysis pipeline named 'CORIGAN' to extract the characteristics of animal communities. CORIGAN is based on the YOLOv3 model as the core of object detection. To illustrate potential applications, we use images collected during a sentinel prey experiment. Our pipeline can be used to detect, count and study the physical interactions between various animals. On our example dataset, the model reaches 86.6% precision and 88.9% recall at the species level or even at the caste level for ants. The training set required fewer than 10 hr of labelling. Based on the pipeline output, it was possible to build the trophic and non-trophic interactions network describing the studied community. CORIGAN relies on generic properties of the detected animals and can be used for a wide range of studies and supports. Here, we study invertebrates on high-resolution images, but the same processing can be transferred for the study of larger animals on satellite or aircraft images."

ASYMMETRICAL PRODUCTION AND PERCEPTION OF SITUATIONALLY SPECIFIC VOCALIZATIONS,ETHOLOGY,101,25,32,,1995,"Many species produce alarm calls that vary according to situation. An implicit assumption for these species is that production and perception of situationally specific alarm calls is symmetrical: perceivers respond to variation produced by signalers. The companion paper to this one (BLUMSTEIN 1995) showed that golden marmots (Marmota caudata aurea) produce variable alarm calls that vary in proportion to the degree of risk the caller perceives. Calls produced in higher-risk situations have fewer notes than calls produced in lower-risk situations. In this study, to determine the salience of the number of notes per call in eliciting different responses in conspecific perceivers, I played back three-note alarm calls, eight-note alarm calls, and the non-alarm vocalization of a local bird to adult golden marmots. Although marmots responded differently to bird calls and alarm calls, vigilance responses to the different alarm calls were similar. Several explanations may account for the apparent insensitivity to alarm-call variation: golden marmots may require additional contextual cues to properly interpret alarm calls, perceptual abilities do not parallel production abilities, or calls may serve a generalized alerting function."

S5 instrument objective is to monitor the composition of Earth atmosphere by taking measurements of trace gases and aerosols impacting air quality and climate, providing daily coverage of Earth atmosphere at an unprecedented resolution. SWIR-SS baseline architecture is a pushbroom imaging spectrometer with two channels, [1589 divided by 1676] nm and [2304 divided by 2386] nm, with a spectral resolution of less than 0.25 mu At the object space is located a Slit-Homogenizer, a special component which guides the optical path across the slit in order to mitigate radiometric errors arising from scene heterogeneity. Its behaviour introduces an astigmatism which is corrected at collimator level by making use of a cylindrical lens. Light is then guided towards the dispersers and is focused onto the detector by the cameras lens. Pupil anamorphism, smile and keystone due to dispersers, immersed gratings, are corrected by using a prism and combining the distortion/lateral color of collimator and focusing cameras in both optical channels. A low pass filter at the dichroic splits the wavelengths, while, for each channel, two successive coatings on front and back faces of the prisms select the band and mitigate out-of-band straylight. The design has the purpose to keep the alignment of each subsystem simple, as no aberration compensations have been foreseen between collimator and focusing camera. It shows robustness, stability vs temperature and high optical quality."

The duration of both feeding (Z= 3.128, p= 0.002) and resting (Z= -2.426, p= 0.015) over the seasons were significantly different for females, while the duration of resting (Z= -2.062, p= 0.039) and vigilance (Z= 2.897, p= 0.002) were significant for males. Moreover, white-lipped deer showed a trimodal distribution of feeding activity during the warm season and a bimodal distribution in the cold season. Moreover, during the cold season gestating females devoted much more time to feeding, likely due to the increased energy demands of pregnancy and the reduced nutritional value of their forage. This data will help with future range-management of white-lipped deer on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its seasonal-dependent cohabitation with local livestock."

A previous study showed that the position a hen takes during resting was affected by perch material, most probably due to its thermal conductivity. The aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of perch surface temperature on resting behaviour and resting comfort in laying hens. In each of two identical trials, three groups of five Lohmann Selected Leghorn hens were housed in each of three compartments in turn (n = 30 birds in six groups). Compartments were equally equipped with one smooth, round galvanised steel perch of 34 mm external diameter. The surface temperatures of perches were controlled by passing water through them, giving temperatures of 15 degrees C, 18 degrees C (room temperature) and 28 degrees C respectively in the three compartments. Hen behaviour was observed at night-time by investigating the proportion of active behavioural patterns and resting (standing or sitting), either with 'head forward motionless and neck withdrawn' or 'head tucked backwards into feathers above wing base or behind a wing.' The number of hens perching and the time spent perching were unaffected by perch temperature. Hens' resting postures, however, were strongly influenced. On the warmest perch, hens rested more with their head forward in a standing position and showed more active behavioural patterns compared to both cooler perches (P < 0.001). On the cooler perches, hens rested more with their head covered by feathers in a sitting and standing position (P < 0.05). Our data show that perch temperature strongly affects laying hens' resting behaviour. In this context, hens are confronted with arising trade-offs between thermoregulatory adjustment of behaviour, optimisation of energy budget, restful roosting and vigilance behaviour.

In three experiments, we investigated how horses respond to (1) urine from wolves and lions, (2) blood from slaughtered conspecifics and fur-derived wolf odour, and (3) a sudden auditory stimulus in either presence or absence of fur-derived wolf odour. The experiments were carried out under standardised conditions using a total of 45 naive, 2-year-old horses. In the first two experiments we found that horses showed significant changes in behaviour (Experiments I and 2: increased sniffing; Experiment 2 only: increased vigilance, decreased eating, and more behavioural shifts), but no increase in heart rate compared to controls when exposed to predator odours and conspecific blood in a known test environment. However, the third experiment showed that exposure to a combination of wolf odour and a sudden stimulus (sound of a moving plastic bag) caused significantly increased heart rate responses and a tendency to a longer latency to resume feeding, compared to control horses exposed to the sudden stimulus without the wolf odour. The results indicate that predator odour per se does not frighten horses but it may cause an increased level of vigilance. The presence of predator odour may, however, cause an increased heart rate response if horses are presented to an additional fear-eliciting stimulus. This strategy may be adaptive in the wild where equids share habitats with their predators, and have to trade-off time and energy spent on anti-predation responses against time allocated to essential non-defensive activities.

Bioindication is a method that applies very sensitive living organisms to detect environmental changes using their natural responses. Although bioindicators do not deliver information on an exact type or intensity of toxicants present in water samples, they do provide an overall snapshot and early-warning information about presence of harmful and dangerous parameters. Despite the advantages of biotests performed on sentinel organisms, their wider application is limited by the nonexistence of high-throughput laboratory automation systems. As a result majority of biotests used in ecotoxicology require time-consuming and laborious manual procedures.In this work, we present development of a miniaturized Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) platform for automation and enhancement of acute ecotoxicity test based on immobilization of a freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna (Daphtoxkit-F (TM)). Daphnids' immobilization in response to sudden changes in environment parameters is fast, unambiguous, and easy to record optically. We also for the first time demonstrate that LOC system enables studies of sub-lethal ecotoxic effects using behavioral responses of Daphnia magna as sentinels of water polution.The system working principle incorporated a high definition (HD) time-resolved video data analysis to dynamically assess impact of the reference toxicant on swimming behavior of D. magna. Our system design combined: (i) microfluidic device for caging of Daphnia sp.; (ii) mechatronic interface for fluidic actuation; (iii) video data acquisition; and (iv) algorithms for animal movement tracking and analysis."

Results showed that conservative religious clothing decreased visual access to female curvaceous body features and instead focused visual attention to the head/face region. Results were discussed in terms of the roles of conservative clothing in women's clothing choice, men's mate retention tactics, and parent-offspring conflict over mate choice."

Variation in the acoustic structure of individual syllables within a call carries information regarding the extent of threat. Given this variation, along with the production of multiple syllables within a repeated call, the syntactical structure of the call could also encode meaningful information. To test for evidence of syntax in Richardson's ground squirrel alarm communication, we presented adult and juvenile subjects with repeated alarm calls with unaltered syllable order and those same calls with syllable order randomized. There was limited evidence that syllable order affected receiver response, but squirrels were more responsive to primary syllables of repeated calls even when these syllables were embedded within randomized calls. This suggests that primary syllables serve a general alerting function, possibly priming receivers for information that follows. Distinctive structural elements of primary syllables, including reduced syllable duration and reduced harmonic durations relative to the fundamental frequency, were correlated with the heightened vigilance responses that these syllables evoked.

Responding to alarm signals can, for instance, maximize survival under predation risk. However, foraging individuals should consider the reliability of such risk-based information to balance antipredator behavior and resource acquisition. Receiver decisions could depend on personality effects, as individual variation in risk-taking tendencies (i.e., boldness) could not only affect receiver perception of the signaled threat but also signaler reliability. Recent theoretical models support the possibility of coevolution between personality and communication strategies. Using a playback experiment, we show that wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) respond to alarm calls according to their own boldness level (measured as consistent individual differences in basal vigilance) and that they increase their vigilance response to bolder callers potentially considered as more reliable. Further, receivers respond to the callers' boldness regardless of their own boldness and independently of their familiarity level with callers, therefore decoding this information from vocalizations. Such effects of individual behavioral variation on the perception and interpretation of social information could apply to signals used in a variety of ecological contexts."

We hypothesised that escape latency and distance in the Andean lizard species Phymaturus williamsi would increase proportionally, but vary according to the means of escape. Over a three-year period we observed seven types of antipredatory behaviour in 98% P. williamsi lizards on simulated predatory bird attacks. Escape distance and latency were positively correlated. 65% of lizards emerged from their refuge within 2 min of an attack. All of these behaviours were positively correlated with escape latency and distance, although we found the former to be more precise. This study contributes to a better understanding of the general antipredatory behaviour in this species of Andean lizard, and will assist in future decisions concerning its conservation."

Using naive dairy calves, Bos taurus, we examined the effects of exposure to a predator odour (coyote, Canis latrans, urine) and two control odours (deer urine and water) on (1) latency to approach a milk food reward, (2) exploration, vigilance and locomotor play, (3) magnitude of the startle response to a sudden noise delivered upon arrival at the feeder and (4) heart rate during feeding in 10 min trials on three consecutive days. In response to predator odour, calves delayed feeding and tended to explore more and play less in the first 30 s of the trial compared to calves exposed to control odours. The duration spent feeding and standing with the head raised (i.e. vigilant) did not differ among treatments. On the first day, calves exposed to predator odour startled more to a sudden noise than control animals. Mean heart rate during feeding decreased across days in the control treatments, but not in the predator treatment, suggesting a sustained response to the predator odour. We conclude that naive domestic calves retain the ability to distinguish between predator and nonpredator odour. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Randler, Christoph",Tail movements in birds-current evidence and new concepts,ORNITHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,15,1,14,,2016,"Birds of a wide range of species show characteristic movements of their tail, often called tail flicking, tail wagging or tail flashing. Tail flicking refers to vertical up-and-down movements of the tail, while tail flashing is defined as a horizontal movement, often including tail spreading. Here, I review proposed functions of such behaviour. Most relate to communication with conspecifics, predators or prey. Tail flashing may induce movement of the bird's prey that makes the prey more vulnerable to capture ('prey-flushing'). Tail movements may signal to a predator that the signaller has detected it ('perception advertisement'), or that the signaller is particularly alert or otherwise difficult to catch ('quality advertisement'). Further, it may warn conspecifics of predators ('alarm signal'), or it may advertise quality as a mate, signal social status, or aid in flock cohesion. This behaviour may, possibly, though it seems unlikely, represent a cue rather than a signal in that it benefits the receiver, but not the signaller. For each postulated function, I develop predictions stemming from that function, and interpret the available empirical evidence in the context of these predictions. I finish by synthesising our current state of knowledge and by identifying the future empirical studies that would most improve our understanding of this widespread but unjustly neglected avian behaviour."

Therefore, we investigated the daily activity of two intraguild predators, Tityus pusillus Pocock, 1893 and Ananteris mauryi Lourenco, 1982, in the presence and absence of each other. Animals were observed in three experimental conditions, containing individuals of T. pusillus (control 1), A. mauryi (control 2), and both species (treatment). In addition, we evaluated the correlation between the number of active individuals with air temperature and humidity. Our results showed that T. pusillus and A. mauryi have similar daily activity between 18:00 and 05:00 h. However, T. pusillus was more active and shifted from a sit-and-wait hunting mode to actively hunting when in the presence of A. mauryi. In contrast, under predation risk, A. mauryi did not change its level of activity but became more vigilant by reducing the frequency of rest, hydration, and mating attempts. Activity of A. mauryi was positively correlated with air humidity whereas activity of T. pusillus was negatively correlated. This work highlights the influence of intraguild predators in the behavioral decisions during daily activities of each other, indicating adaptive behaviors in both prey and predator."

This study reports the first evidence that the presence of conspecifics continues to influence the caching behaviour of a scatter-hoarding mammal, the grey squirrel, after a suitable cache site has been selected and the hoarder is filling and covering its cache. Wild grey squirrels were filmed when storing preferred and less preferred nuts and when they were alone or with conspecifics present. In line with previous findings, squirrels spent longer travelling from the nut patch and were more vigilant when conspecifics were present. However, squirrels also spent longer disguising their caches and were more likely to stop digging and become vigilant when conspecifics were present than when they were alone. In particular, they were most likely to curtail their digging when storing their preferred nuts in the presence of conspecifics. The results indicate that caching squirrels remain sensitive to the presence of conspecifics until the cache is complete and that they respond flexibly to conspecifics according to the type of food they are storing."

To find out how singing of the chaffinch is associated with antipredatory behavior, I studied perch selection in mature pine forest and in pine saplings, two habitats differing in the amount of cover for protection from predators. My results show that male chaffinches prefer to sing below the canopy of mature pines and in the uppermost parts of sapling pines. Although these are the canopy parts most exposed to sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) attacks, staying in open sites may be a beneficial strategy for singing chaffinches because it makes it possible to improve antipredatory vigilance. This assumption was supported by the hawk experiments. After being exposed to the sparrowhawk model, all of the singing birds selected the conspicuous perch below the canopy of mature pines. The males that perched higher in the canopy before the experiment moved to the lower canopy, whereas those males that sang below the canopy did not change their singing perch."

Habitats are defined as recognizable plant associations and the landscape as the collection of all available habitat types. The study was conducted in Mikumi National Park, Tanzania. At the within-landscape level, all sex and age classes of giraffes exhibited high degrees of preference for riverine habitats. Sex differences in habitat selection were mostly due to females with young, who tended to select open floodplain habitats in which their vigilance time was lowest. Males, and females without young, preferred more heavily-wooded habitat. Habitat preferences were not related to observed habitat-specific forage intake rates for either males or females. Within habitats, male and female giraffes selected different feeding heights, males feeding higher in the canopy than females. Females showed a strong tendency to generalize with respect to feeding height. It is suggested that a sexual dimorphism-body size hypothesis provides a parsimonious explanation for the observed feeding height selection patterns, whereas a reproductive strategy hypothesis can explain sex-differences in habitat selection patterns within the landscape."

Audible calls have a larger active space than ultrasonic calls because they travel farther, are louder, and contain frequencies to which conspecific and allospecific recipients are more sensitive. In our first experiment, we presented an alarming stimulus to 103 squirrels to examine the effect of threat proximity on signal type. The ratio of ultrasonic to audible alarm calls increased with increasing distance from the stimulus. We conclude that the size of the active space influences signalling strategy and that squirrels emitting ultrasonic calls can signal conspecifics to the exclusion of distant predators. As recipients of ultrasonic calls must be close to the signaler, one context in which ultrasonic calling may be most adaptive is during natal emergence when juveniles are particularly abundant, highly vulnerable to predation, and clustered in space. In our second experiment, we broadcast ultrasonic alarm signals to emerging juveniles and found that they, like older individuals, responded to calls by increasing vigilance. We discuss the adaptive utility of multiple signalling strategies in light of our findings."

These changes would influence the supervision of a continuous process, characterized with high mental demands. It is important to assess if the types of displays are relevant for the needs of the operators supervising the process during day and night shifts. Inadequate information processing induced by some types of presentation of the information as well as temporal fluctuations in human reasoning may have consequences on the reliability anti the operators' workload. In line with many experimental and field studies on shiftwork effect, we then expect that the survey activity of a continuous process will quantitatively and qualitatively vary according to the level of vigilance. Our study was performed in a control room of a chemical plant. We investigated the supervisory activity of controllers working on 3 x 8 shifts with shift changes at 4 am, noon and 8 pm. All the screen pages they selected were recorded over: 18 whole shifts. Data were treated according to the frequency of consultation and the type of information gathering. We observed quantitative and qualitative alterations in supervisory activity on normal operation according to cognitive demands of the task and to the internal state of the operator. The call frequency was higher in the afternoon than at night, when the level of vigilance is the lowest. When analysing the type of information called, differences also appeared according to the time of the day. For example, the consultation of trend pages was higher at night than in the other shifts. The operators would adopt different supervisory behavior during day and night shifts, looking for various types of information displayed. These strategies of supervision could suggest that modes of information processing would depend on circadian variations."

In a mixed-species colony of Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo and Grey Herons Ardea cinerea, we investigated defensive responses to potential avian predators and to actual avian predators. Our observations revealed that the birds distinguished between potential predators and reacted to particular predator species that could prey on large birds. Moreover, we found that the two colonial species showed different defensive antipredator behaviours: Herons exhibited aggressively defensive behaviours; whereas Cormorants, though vigilant, remained on the nest. To our knowledge this is the first report to suggest the possibility of commensalism in the Phalacrocoracidae, whereby Great Cormorants benefit from the defensive behaviour of Grey Herons."

Although movement is generally considered to be dangerous, at large scales, movement may be important for predator avoidance and the predictability of such movement may be key. We examine the movement patterns of a small bird (Junco hyemalis) in winter to better understand how these birds might respond to the trade-off of unpredictable movements for predator avoidance with the foraging benefits of visiting large, predictable food sources. We manipulated resources by adding feeders to junco home ranges and compared the movement patterns of these flocks to those without access to feeders. Juncos with access to feeders were more spatially and temporally predictable, had reduced movement rates and smaller home range sizes. Our results suggest that the influence of resource distribution on junco movements is high. Juncos with highly productive and predictable resource hotspots may place more value on resources than remaining unpredictable. Consequently, they may be employing non-movement methods of anti-predator behavior, such as vigilance, at feeders, although this requires further investigation."

Sentinel egg cards were used to quantify mortality by parasitoids and predators at an intensively monitored location in Santa Cruz to reveal seasonality, and at other sites in Santa Cruz and San Francisco to measure spatial variation and parasitoid species composition. In addition to egg mortality, egg mass use efficiency by Trichogramma parasitoids was also examined under field conditions. The egg parasitoids primarily consisted of three Trichogramma species, T. deion, T. fasciatum and T. platneri. Previously unknown to California, T. fasciatum was shown to displace the indigenous T. platneri over a two-year period as the predominant egg parasitoid attacking LBAM egg masses. Based on the number of parasitized eggs per sentinel egg card, it is argued that individual females of at least some Trichogramma species have the capacity to oviposit more than 50 eggs in the egg mass of a host, warranting further studies to document the egg mass use efficiency and oviposition traits of other trichogrammatids under field conditions. Although egg parasitism was limited to causing elevated mortality during the summer and fall only, egg predation occurred more consistently throughout the year and is likely to be of considerable significance in suppressing LBAM populations in California. Combined with the use of a Type II survivorship curve, the importance of using a temperature-dependent physiological time scale to quantify egg mortality is illustrated when sentinel hosts are exposed to natural enemies in the field for less than the entire duration of the 'window of susceptibility' to parasitism and predation."

Compositional syntax has been investigated in mobbing calls of two closely related tit species, the Japanese Tit Parus minor and the Great Tit Parus major, but with one contrasting result: hearing calls in the reversed order diminished the behavioural responses of Japanese Tits but only partially those of Great Tits. This difference may have been due to an external factor such as the season in which the experiment was undertaken, as the Japanese Tits were tested in winter and Great Tits in spring. Here, we studied the responses of Great Tits towards natural and reversed mobbing sequences during spring and winter by investigating two behaviours: approaching and vigilance behaviours. We found that sensitivity to syntax reversal was impacted by the season. The birds were vigilant but less likely to approach reversed calls in winter. However, the opposite occurred in spring, with the birds scanning less but still approaching. This study suggests that the perception of combinatorial calls in Great Tits is influenced by the season, emphasizing the importance of context in studies investigating complex cognitive processing in animals."

Game theoretic models of how animals manage predation risk have begun to describe predator responses to prey behaviour relatively recently. This is partly because our understanding of how terrestrial predators select vertebrate prey is often limited to numerical and functional responses to measures of prey abundance. Prey vulnerability, however, may improve our understanding of predation because predators could maximize foraging success by selecting prey on this basis.2. We tested the hypothesis that sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus L.), a typical generalist predator, hunt redshanks (Tringa totanus L.), a favoured prey species on coastal shores, primarily on the basis of their vulnerability rather than their abundance.3. Five direct measures or indicators of redshank behaviour predicted sparrowhawk attack success in a multipredictor statistical model and therefore serve as measures of redshank vulnerability.4. These and other vulnerability measures influenced whether sparrowhawks decided to hunt redshanks on saltmarsh habitat. A model that included most of these measures predicted correctly whether sparrowhawks hunted redshanks (attack decision) 90% of the time and accounted for up to 75% of variation. Prey abundance accounted for no additional variation.5. Thus the hunting behaviour of some predators can only be predicted well by several highly dynamic and interacting factors related to prey vulnerability. These results mean that, theoretically at least, the management of prey populations may sometimes be achieved best by manipulating prey vulnerability, rather than by culling their predators."

Previous studies demonstrated heritable differences among populations from adjacent but ecologically divergent habitat types in morphology, behavior and life history. Here we examined male mating behavior in fish from the most extreme habitat, the sulfidic Cueva del Azufre (cave mollies), and a nearby non-sulfidic river (i.e., the least extreme habitat type) as well as hybrids (F1 and F2) between both populations. Compared to surface-dwelling males, mollies showed strongly reduced sexual activity, which may be an adaptation to life in a stressful, energy-poor environment. However, sexual activity of first-generation hybrids even exceeded the level of the surface fish, suggesting that a heterosis effect leads to strongly increased sexual activity. To avoid unwanted copulations, surface females are more vigilant in the presence of a male than in the presence of a female, which detracts from the time spent feeding. Reduced sexual activity in cave mollies comes along with reduced vigilance in females, so cave molly females do not feed less when accompanied by a male. Despite increased sexual activity in F1 hybrid males, F1 females did not feed less in the presence of a male (i.e., resumed feeding even though males frequently attempted to mate) and also no effect was seen in the F2 hybrids. This could indicate a breakdown of co-evolved gene complexes of (i) male persistence traits (i.e., population-specific levels of male sexual activity) and (ii) female resistance traits (vigilance and flight behavior)."

During a study of Sonoran pronghorn in a semi-captive breeding facility in southern Arizona, we observed behaviors and timing of life-history events that have not been documented in peer-reviewed literature, including birth dates of fawns, pre-parturient and post-parturient behavior, timing of breeding season, behavior during the breeding season, date of horn casting by males, and response to predators. Behavior of the Sonoran pronghorn before and after parturition, during breeding, and toward predators was consistent with that reported for other subspecies. Timing of breeding, parturition, and horn casting all occurred earlier than reported for more northerly Populations. Variation in timing of life-history activities was the main difference between the Sonoran pronghorn and other subspecies and Would be expected due to the correspondence between seasonal rainfall and forage conditions in the Sonoran Desert and timing of parturition."

The study was carried out in four habitats (agricultural land, grassy field, mudflat, and shallow wetland) at Boyo Wetland and two habitats (grassland and swampy habitat) in the Bale Mountains. Instantaneous scan sampling was used to collect the daily activity time budget, scanning each individual in turn and categorizing its behaviour in six behavioural states. We made observations from 06:00 to 18:00 from October through June 2014/2016 and 2016/2017. We performed ANOVA and T-test to look at how diurnal activity pattern differed among habitat types and time periods of the day. Foraging was most prevalent, accounting for 39% of the time budget followed by locomotion (20%) and vigilance (16 %) and social behaviour (2 %). The time spent on various activity patterns across habitats and between seasons were significantly different (p <0.05). Across habitats, the daily pattern for foraging and locomotion showed two peaks, in the agricultural habitat and grassland habitats, whereas percent time devoted to vigilance, resting and comfort movement followed an inverse pattern, peaking at mudflats and shallow wetland. The Wattled Crane spends more time feeding on farmland than in the wetland. This could create conflict with farmers and threaten the Wattled Crane. Therefore, urgent actions are needed to restore the degraded wetlands."

The scrounger tactic may provide greater antipredator benefits than the producer tactic because scroungers hop with their heads up and tend to occupy central positions in a group, whereas producers hop with their heads down and tend to occupy edge positions. We tested whether increasing an individual's vulnerability to predation (using wing-loading manipulations) causes an increased preference for the scrounger tactic in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Wing-loading manipulations were effective at increasing focal individuals' perception of vulnerability to predation; treatment individuals increased their total time allocated to vigilance, whereas control individuals did not. Treatment individuals also increased their use of the scrounger tactic (proportion of hops with head up) and scrounged a greater proportion of patches, whereas control individuals exhibited no changes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the scrounger tactic confers greater antipredator benefits than the producer tactic, although whether antipredator benefits are achieved through differences in head orientation, spatial position, or both, remains unclear. Our finding that individuals adjust their use of the scrounger tactic according to changes in their phenotype provides evidence for phenotype-limited allocation strategies in producer-scrounger games."

This study used the Sentinel-1A descending and ascending orbits data to detect the deformations of fast ice in the Baltic Sea. A method for automatically obtaining fast ice edge line by combining interferometric coherence image and SAR amplitude image was proposed. Then, the deformations of fast ice were detected from different incidence angles with the descending and ascending orbits data. The results showed that the deformations in radar line of sight obtained from the descending and ascending orbits data were 38cm and 37cm respectively within the fast ice region of 960km(2) in the study area. The continuous strong southwest wind was the principal reason for the deformation, and the deformation direction was dominated by east to west. Moreover, the inner fast ice kept stable and its deformation was smaller due to the protection of outer consolidated ice. The experimental results in this paper showed that the deformation trend and characteristics of fast ice can be better understood by InSAR technology with multi-orbits SAR data."

We examined whether the anti-predation strategies of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) are adapted to the hunting strategies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Tdi chimpanzees search for red colobus groups, approach them silently and hunt co-operatively. Our playback experiments and observations of natural encounters revealed that red colobus hid higher up the trees in positions where exposure to the forest floor is minimal and became silent, when chimpanzees were close. They moved away silently through the canopy, when chimpanzees were still at some distance. However, if a group of diana monkeys was nearby in the latter situation, red colobus sought their presence even if they had to move towards the chimpanzees. Chimpanzees refrained from hunting associated red colobus groups, probably because diana monkeys are excellent sentinels for predators approaching over the forest floor. Thus several elements of both the predator's and the prey's strategies correspond to each other. Finally, we compared the interactions between the two species in Tai and in Gombe, Tanzania. We suggest that the difference in size ratio between the two species at the two sites and adaptation of hunting techniques and of escape modes to different forest structures can explain why Gombe red colobus attack chimpanzees while Tai red colobus try to escape. We conclude that predator-prey interactions can indeed lead to evolutionary arms races, with the specific form of co-adaptations depending on environmental factors."

Cranes are territorial in the breeding season, and usually gregarious during migration and wintering. Only 2% of the families present in our study area were territorial, all other families foraged in flocks with immatures and adult pairs. Territorial pairs defended the same winter territory year after year, but only when they bad offspring. They were gregarious otherwise. The average breeding success measured throughout several years was higher in territorial pairs. Winter territories were small (0.7 km(2) on average), but included a higher diversity of habitats than the areas visited by gregarious birds (11.7 km(2) on average). Adults of territorial families showed longer vigilance times, and lower food intake rates than did adults in flocks, which were compensated with a longer time spent foraging per day. The accumulated daily food intake did not differ between adults in flocks and in families. We suggest that winter territoriality is a facultative strategy, conditioned by parental experience and habitat availability."

Studies of alarm communication in Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii) have focussed on juvenile signalers and receivers; however, adult and juvenile receivers may tailor their response to alarm calls based on different underlying signal parameters and attend differentially to alarm calls broadcast by adult versus juvenile signalers. To examine the potential influence of signaler and receiver age on the perception of response urgency, we presented free-living juvenile and adult S. richardsonii with alarm calls produced by juveniles and adults. Behavioral responses of call recipients were videotaped and analyzed to determine the influence of signaler and receiver age-class. No differences in vigilance response after juvenile- and adult-produced calls were detected for either adult or juvenile receivers. At the proximate level, the absence of any detectable difference in the acoustic attributes of juvenile-versus adult-produced calls may account for the lack of differential response. The absence of any age-dependent productional difference also is consistent with the recently advanced notion of young concealing information regarding their age in their alarm signals."

It examines the relationship between mobile phone access, citizen engagement, and appropriation of the technology by the governing elite for political communication and electoral campaigns. It concludes that Ghana has witnessed a rich convergence of mobile telephony and broadcast media which, in tandem with an open political environment, has significantly transformed the ecology of political communication. This development has helped to deepen democratic engagement among citizens, and between citizens and the political class, by fostering civic vigilance and accountability and facilitating multivocal expression of views from a more diverse constituency of political participants. However, while mobile phones and related platforms have allowed contra-and counter-hegemonic voices in Ghanaian politics to find expression across the electromagnetic spectrum, this access should not be construed to necessarily mean that political discourse has shifted in significant ways as to alter the fundamental structures of political power. Overall, the fundamental structures of political power and the levers of control remain unassailed by ordinary citizens, despite some of the progress made possible by mobile telephony."

We hypothesized that the location of spawning sites in spring streams would affect the extent of exposure of cutthroat trout fry to M. cerebralis triactinomyxons (tams), occurrence of the parasite in their bodies, and clinical signs of whirling disease. The spring streams were warm relative to nearby streams flowing from the mountains or spawning and emergence of fry was early compared with fish in mountain streams. Tams were abundant early in the summer and clinical signs of whirling disease among age-0 fish were seen as early as mid-June in one stream. There were high densities of tams in one stream, and densities declined with upstream progression from May through July, whereas in the other stream, low densities of tams were observed in the downstream portion early in the summer, and they were not detected in July and August. Age-0 cutthroat trout were abundant; clinical signs of whirling disease were evident, and histological evidence of whirling disease was common in the stream where tams were abundant. Low densities of age-0 cutthroat trout and no clinical signs of whirling disease were observed in the stream where tams were not abundant. Among sentinel fish in the stream with abundant tams, we found extensive occurrence of M. cerebralis, with many fish showing clinical signs and histological evidence of pathology associated with M. cerebralis. The proportion of sentinel fish with clinical and histological signs of whirling disease decreased with upstream progression. In the stream with low tam, densities sentinel fish became infected with M. cerebralis, but there were essentially no clinical signs or histological indications of whirling disease."

The north component has, however, been difficult to retrieve due to the limited sensitivity of standard InSAR observations in that direction. Here, we address this problem by using time-series analysis of along-track interferometric observations in burst-overlap areas of the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scan imaging mode of the Sentinel-1 radar satellites. We apply this method to the southern part of the near-north striking Dead Sea transform fault to show that the similar to 5 mm/year relative motion is well recovered. Furthermore, the results indicate the locking depth of the fault decreases toward the south as it enters the transtensional Gulf of Aqaba basin. Our results show that time-series analysis of burst-overlap interferometric observations can be used to obtain meaningful interseismic deformation rates of slow-moving and northerly striking faults.Plain Language Summary Measurements of interseismic deformation near plate-boundary faults are used to estimate how large and how often major earthquakes are likely to occur and thus provide crucial input for regional seismic hazard assessments. Geodetic GPS data have primarily been used for this task, but increasingly Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations from satellites have provided useful information, particularly in areas where GPS observations are scarce. However, InSAR observations are only sensitive to the east and vertical components of deformation, but not to the north component, and are thus of limited use to study northerly striking earthquake faults. To address this problem, we combine an advanced processing technique called burst-overlap interferometry (BOI) with time-series analysis of a large data set to retrieve millimeter per year details of north-south deformation. We apply this method to the north-striking southern Dead Sea fault to show that the earthquake hazard decreases toward the south as the fault enters Gulf of Aqaba and approaches the Red Sea rift. Our study demonstrates that this method of BOI time-series analysis allows mapping the interseismic deformation of slow-moving and north-striking faults."

Foraging, vigilance, aggressive behavior, and habitat choice of shorebirds were affected by the presence of gulls. There were significant differences in the time each species devoted to actively feeding; knots spent significantly less time foraging than did the other species. Birds congregated in the habitats where their foraging rates were the highest. When turnstones and laughing gulls fed in larger conspecific flocks, they had higher foraging times. Red knots were most aggressive toward laughing gulls, turnstones were most aggressive toward herring gulls, sanderlings were most aggressive toward turnstones, and semipalmated sandpipers were most aggressive toward knots.There were significant differences in habitat use: 1) Gulls and turnstones were more abundant along the tide line, 2) turnstones were more abundant on the upper beach, 3) semipalmated sandpipers and turnstones were more abundant on sandbars, 4) only gulls fed on the beach mud, and 5) laughing gulls and semipalmated sandpipers were more common along creeks than were the other species.Within 5 minutes of a human disturbance, gulls returned to predisturbance levels, while the shorebirds did not. Shorebirds responded most strongly to the presence of dogs than to other disturbances and did not return to beaches following a disturbance by a dog. These observations suggest that there may be some competition for foraging space among foraging species, especially between the shorebirds and the larger gulls, that human disturbance affects shorebirds more strongly than gulls, and that shorebirds and gulls use the habitats differently. The data can be used to manage human disturbance and to protect habitats where the shorebirds have the highest foraging rates, but the least exposure to gulls."

Body size is a decisive functional trait in many organisms, especially for phytoplankton, which span several orders of magnitude in cell volume. Therefore, the analysis of size as a functional trait driving species' performance has received wide attention in aquatic ecology, amended in recent decades by studies documenting changes in phytoplankton size in response to abiotic or biotic factors in the environment.2. We performed a systematic literature review to provide an overarching, partially quantitative synthesis of cell size as a driver and sentinel of phytoplankton ecology. We found consistent and significant allometric relationships between cell sizes and the functional performance of phytoplankton species (cellular rates of carbon fixation, respiration and exudation as well as resource affinities, uptake and content). Size scaling became weaker, absent or even negative when addressing C- or volume-specific rates or growth. C-specific photosynthesis and population growth rate peaked at intermediate cell sizes around 100 mu m(3).3. Additionally, we found a rich literature on sizes changing in response to warming, nutrients and pollutants. Whereas small cells tended to dominate under oligotrophic and warm conditions, there are a few notable exceptions, which indicates that other environmental or biotic constraints alter this general trend. Grazing seems a likely explanation, which we reviewed to understand both how size affects edibility and how size structure changes in response to grazing. Cell size also predisposes the strength and outcome of competitive interactions between algal species. Finally, we address size in a community context, where size-abundance scaling describes community composition and thereby the bio-diversity in phytoplankton assemblages.4. We conclude that (a) size is a highly predictive trait for phytoplankton metabolism at the cellular scale, with less strong and nonlinear implications for growth and specific metabolism and (b) size structure is a highly suitable sentinel of phytoplankton responses to changing environments."

Most available algorithms typically focus on single-image techniques which do not take into account the backscatter signature of a land surface under non-flooded conditions. In this study, harmonic analysis of a multi-temporal time series of >500 ENVISAT Advanced SAR (ASAR) scenes with a spatial resolution of 150 m was used to characterise the seasonality in backscatter under non-flooded conditions. Pixels which were inundated during a large-scale flood event during the summer 2007 floods of the River Severn (United Kingdom) showed strong deviations from normal seasonal behaviour as inferred from the harmonic model. The residuals were classified by means of an automatic threshold optimisation algorithm after masking out areas which are unlikely to be flooded using a topography-derived index. The results were validated against a reference dataset derived from high-resolution airborne imagery. For the water class, accuracies > 80% were found for non-urban land uses. A slight underestimation of the reference flood extent can be seen, mostly due to the lower spatial resolution of the ASAR imagery. Finally, an outlook for the proposed algorithm is given in the light of the Sentinel-1 mission. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Parenting variables included involvement-vigilance, racial socialization, communication about sex, and clear expectations for alcohol use. Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that intervention-induced changes in parenting were linked with changes in responsive-supportive parent-child relationships and youth self-control."

One striking example is the nests birds build for reproduction, which protect the offspring from external stressors such as predators and temperature, promoting reproductive success. To construct a nest successfully, birds need to make various decisions, for example regarding the nest material and their time budgets. Research has focused mainly on species where one sex is primarily responsible for building the nest. In contrast, the cooperative strategies of monogamous species in which both sexes contribute to nest building are poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of both sexes in nest building and fitness correlates of behaviour in wild, monogamous jackdaw pairs, Corvus monedula. We show that both partners contributed to nest building and behaved similarly, with females and males present in the nestbox for a comparable duration and transporting material to the nest equally often. However, while females spent more time constructing the nest, males tended to invest more time in vigilance, potentially as a means of coping with competition for nest cavities. These findings suggest a moderate degree of division of labour, which may facilitate cooperation. Moreover, some aspects of behaviour were related to proxies of reproductive success (lay date and egg volume). Females that contributed relatively more to bringing material laid earlier clutches and pairs that spent less time together in the nestbox had larger eggs. Thus, selection pressures may act on how nest-building pairs spend their time and cooperatively divide the labour. We conclude that cooperative nest building in birds could be associated with monogamy and obligate biparental care and provides a vital but relatively untapped context through which to study the evolution of cooperation.

Responses to risk include increased vigilance and reduced foraging, movement to safe habitats, increases or decreases in group size, and changes in patterns of movement. While we know that prey can detect and respond to both long term (LT) and short term (ST) variation in risk, field studies have only recently begun to consider how these responses might differ. Here, we hypothesize that prey movement patterns should respond differently to cues of LT and ST variation in risk. Specifically, cues of elevated LT risk might lead to decreased movement to improve the assessment of ST risk, while elevated ST risk might favor increased movement to reduce the proximity or duration of risks that are already assessed to be acute. We further hypothesize that decreases in movement are likely to be a general response to LT risk, while responses to ST risk are likely to vary in a manner that depends on the type of predator. In Liuwa Plain National Park, we found that wildebeest movements responded to the local intensity of predator use (LT risk), after controlling for other seasonal, diurnal and bottom-up effects. Speed decreased considerably and turning angles increased considerably, combining to markedly decrease linear movements. In contrast, immediate encounters with predators (ST risk) typically provoked fast, linear flight, and this effect was stronger for encounters with coursing predators. The effect of long term risk was to cause wildebeest to move more slowly and less linearly, i.e. to slow down and turn around, as part of a suite of behavioral responses, which also includes increased vigilance, that promote cautious assessment of ST risks when in locations with high levels of LT risk. This result has broad implications of understanding the influence of predation risk on foraging patterns of ungulates as this relationship is much more complex than simple avoidance of areas of 'high risk'."

The analysis of roosting behaviour is crucial to understand many aspects of bat ecology and social dynamics, but it can be hard to do in natural conditions, especially in cave-dwelling bats. In two species of long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris curasoae and L. yerbabuenae), reproductively active males display a unique smearing behaviour and develop an odoriferous dorsal patch during the reproductive season, presumably involved in female mate choice. As a first step to study the smearing behaviour under controlled conditions, in this study, we analysed the roosting behaviour of a captive group of 18 adult individuals (1:1 sex ratio) of L. curasoae through analysis of day-round (24 hrs) video recordings. We succeeded in producing an ethogram and in estimating the daily time budgets of the group. We also examined the effect of sex and condition of males (with dorsal patch, without dorsal patch) on behaviour. We identified 18 behaviours and classified them into five first-order categories (general maintenance, locomotion, vigilance, social and sexual) and two behavioural states (resting and self-grooming). Behaviours related to muscle and fur maintenance were the most frequent (wing stretching and self-grooming, respectively). Social behaviours (allogrooming and pushing) were relatively infrequent. The latter result suggests loose or cryptic inter-individual liaisons, probably associated with the natural dynamics of colony composition. The main difference between males and females was the expression of hugs (male to female), suggesting that this could be a sexual behaviour (pre-copulatory or pair-bonding). The behaviour of males was independent of the presence of a dorsal patch. We discuss the need for additional research to find the correlates of dorsal patch activity in order to control these variables in future studies aimed to investigate the smearing behaviour in captivity."

Active restoration to rehabilitate degraded tropical lands often involves planting tree seedlings, an effective but expensive approach if large areas are planted. Planting small patches of vegetation (tens to a few hundred square metres) has recently been suggested as a more economical restoration technique that mimics natural regeneration processes. However, few studies have examined the consequences of restoration patch size on animals, whose presence and activities are often key to successful ecosystem recovery.2. We examined the effects of patch size on the foraging behaviour of four resident tropical bird species in a replicated forest restoration experiment in southern Costa Rica. We also measured arthropod abundance and anti-predator vigilance behaviour to assess whether variation in food availability or predation risk could explain patch size effects on foraging behaviour.3. Prey attack rates were highest, and the effort required to find prey was lowest, in larger patches for three of the four bird species. Arthropod density was approximately twice as great in larger patches (> 3500 m(2)) compared with smaller patches (< 350 m(2)). Evidence for patch size differences in predation risk was more limited but risk may be higher in smaller patches. The results indicate that food availability is the primary mechanism driving patch size effects on foraging behaviour, with predation risk being an additional influence for some species in some years.4. Synthesis and applications. As demonstrated in this study, patches of tens to a few hundreds of metres squared are likely to provide fewer food resources and potentially less cover from predators for vertebrates that use woody habitat, compared with patches of a few thousand square metres. The more limited resources in smaller patches are likely to have short-term and, potentially, long-term consequences for the fitness of organisms. When considering restoration project design, the potential economic and other benefits of planting in smaller patches must be weighed with the potentially negative ecological effects on some taxonomic groups. To increase the probability that patches provide adequate habitat for the largest number of species, we recommend that when financial resources are available, patches of at least a few thousand square metres be planted."

Knowing the role of environmental factors in influencing crop phenology patterns and processes is a key aspect for understanding the impact of climate and land use changes on agricultural landscape dynamics. We identified pixels with similar phenological behavior (i.e., pheno-clusters) and compared them to the land cover map of the study area to assess the role of the land management component in controlling the phenological patterns identified. Results demonstrated that soil texture is the most important factor for permanent crops, while large amount of rainfall and high values of available water content are the main drivers in spring cultivations (i.e., irrigated crops). Scarce water availability (in terms of soil texture, low annual precipitation and high minimum temperature) represented the main driving factor for non-irrigated crops, whose phenology is characterized by summer drought and fall-winter productivity. Compared to vegetation maps that use only land cover from a single season or period, using seasonality of the NDVI time series to classify the agricultural landscape provides different and more ecologically relevant information about croplands."

Most of the studies on birds, however, have focused on passerine systems perhaps due to the traditional view that passerine vocalizations are more complex. We investigated the presence of a risk-based alarm calling system in a nonpasserine, the herring gull, Larus argentatus, by recording birds presented with varying degrees of threat, and experimentally exposing and quantifying responses to manipulated alarm calls. We found that herring gulls communicate threat urgency in their alarm calls using both frequency and time parameters. Sound recordings indicated that herring gulls change centre frequency modulation patterns of their alarm calls, generate frequency discontinuities in notes and increase the rate of calling with increases in perceived threat level. Playback experiments showed that conspecifics pay attention to both frequency and time parameters and respond most urgently to playbacks of high-threat calls at a high call rate. A less urgent response to high-threat calls at a low call rate and to low-threat calls at a high call rate suggests that threat urgency information is reinforced by both call type and call rate in the herring gull system. This study is one of the first demonstrations of a risk-based alarm calling system in a nonpasserine. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Data were obtained from pairs across the island generally for comparison with skuas (fringe-dwellers) nesting away from Adelie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae, colonies. While most defended territories included colonies of Adelie Penguins, Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica or Southern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides, others held no surface-nesting seabirds; however, all skuas took penguin material. Activities of two fringe-dwelling pairs, whose territories included fulmars, and fulmars and petrels, were intensively monitored; behaviours were associated mostly with brooding, vigilance or foraging. Foraging trips were longer and less frequent where only fulmars bred, but hunting success was similar to that of the pair hunting in petrel and fulmar colonies. The small number of fringe-dwelling pairs produced proportionally fewer chicks than others; the need to forage away from nesting areas, and to obtain penguin material, even when feeding territories include Antarctic Petrels and or Southern Fulmars, indicates the lower quality of their territories (which may vary). Breeding and other activities are considered in relation to breeding chronology of other local seabirds: the breeding success of fringe-dwellers may be modified by that of neighbouring seabird colonies."
"ALONSO, JA; ALONSO, JC",AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN TIME BUDGETS AND PARENTAL CARE IN WINTERING COMMON CRANES,AUK,110,78,88,,1993,"We compared the behavior and food intake rate of parent, nonparent and juvenile wintering Common Cranes (Grus grus) to evaluate possible costs and benefits resulting from parental care. Time devoted to feeding and food intake rates were highest in autumn after arrival from the breeding areas, and decreased throughout the winter in all birds. This decrease was in part determined by a decrease in food availability, but also by satiation, as suggested by the increasing time devoted to resting and other nonforaging activities. juveniles spent more time feeding and less time alert and preening than birds of both adult classes until February, but had achieved the same time budget as nonparent adults in March, when most juveniles were already independent from their parents. Increased feeding time allowed juveniles to obtain the same daily food intake as nonparent adults during the winter. Juveniles did not change their time budget when the family was in a flock, but the net intake rate of juveniles decreased due to interference from other birds. Parents spent less time feeding and resting, and more time scanning than nonparents. Parental vigilance effort was higher in isolated families than in flocks. However, parents seemed not to suffer from parental care, since their net and absolute intake rates were higher than those of nonparent adults."

In a captive flock of house sparrows, we observed the behaviour of the birds when they were foraging on a grid containing clumps of seeds. We measured the fighting success of the birds, determined the method by which they found food clumps (finding or joining), and measured their feeding rate. Joining were frequently observed and usually involved aggressive interactions. Most birds used both finding and joining to obtain food. We found that foraging method was related to dominance: the frequency of joining gradually increased with increasing dominance rank, as predicted by the phenotype limited model for flocks where there are moderate competitive asymmetries among the birds. Food intake rate of individuals was not related to either their dominance rank or foraging method. Similar weak relationships were predicted by the model among these variables for flocks with moderate competitive asymmetries. Behavioural variability among sparrows in locomotion frequency and vigilance was not related to their foraging method, but the rate of investigating potential food caches strongly decreased with increasing frequency of joining. We conclude that the phenotype limited model successfully predicts the relationship between dominance and joining frequency in house sparrows feeding on concentrated food sources, and we suggest that the distribution of food used in tests of the model may crucially affect their results."

However, human use of protected areas can cause disturbance to wildlife, especially in areas that allow hunting and if humans are accompanied by dogs (Canis familiaris). We used citizen-science run camera traps to investigate how humans, dogs and coyotes (Canis latrans) used 33 protected areas and analyzed behavioral responses by three prey species: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and northern raccoon (Procyon lotor). We obtained 52,863 detections of native wildlife, 162,418 detections of humans and 23,332 detections of dogs over 42,874 camera nights. Most dogs (99%) were on the trail, and 89% of off-trail dogs were accompanied by humans. Prey avoided dogs, humans and coyotes temporally, but did not avoid them spatially, or greatly increase vigilance. Our results indicate that humans are perceived as a greater risk than coyotes, and this increases when dogs accompany their owners. The concentration of dogs on the trail with their owners, and relatively minor behavioral impacts on prey, contrasts the strong negative ecological effects found in studies of free ranging dogs. We found dog management to be effective: prohibiting dogs in protected areas reduced their use of an area by a factor of 10 and leash laws increased leashing rates by 21%. Although millions of dogs use natural areas in North America each year, regulations enacted by protected areas combined with responsible management of dog behavior greatly reduce the ecological impact of man's best friend.

There were also within-group attention bias differences such that individuals low in psychoticism exhibited cognitive vigilance for both happy and angry faces relative to neutral, while those high in psychoticism did not show preferential processing of emotional expressions.

We examined the latter possibility by evaluating foraging behaviour and size of lesser snow geese over a period during which their habitat became severely degraded. We show that in this now-degraded habitat, adults spend more of their total time in motor activities and less time in vigilance and comfort behaviours. Goslings spend less of their total time foraging and more in comfort and other behaviours. The pecking rate of both adults and goslings while foraging increases, as do motor and searching behaviours of adults. These changes have not enabled the birds to keep pace with the loss of vegetation, and the size of goslings has continued to decline, likely leading to a reduction in reproductive success. The persistent use of degraded salt marsh is probably related to philopatry and will further damage the marsh."
"FLASSKAMP, A",THE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF AVIAN MOBBING .5. AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST OF THE MOVE ON HYPOTHESIS,ETHOLOGY,96,322,333,,1994,"This paper presents the first experimental study of the effects of mobbing on predators. Two captive little owls Athene noctua and a tawny owl Strix aluco, having stabilized activity patterns and roosting sites, were singly confronted with one or two mobbing blackbirds Turdus merula. The little owls showed marked stress (gular fluttering, panting and panic flights), abandoned chosen roosts and remained unsettled for several days. A permanent alternative roost was chosen after one mobbing encounter, other encounters resulted in several days of 'floating' before returning to the original sites. One little owl used 'camouflage' by 'freezing' during repeated harassments, the other tended to retaliate if mobbing was close and weak. The tawny owl seemed to ignore the rather weak blackbird mobbing, but abandoned its roost for up to 36 h when mobbed by larger numbers of woodland birds at close range. It is concluded that mobbing causes profound distress, especially in small, vulnerable predators like the little owl and forces it to change its daytime roost. If abandoning the area is not possible, time and energy are expended in increased vigilance as a protection against further mobbing attacks. Thus there is strong support for the 'Move on' hypothesis.Results also support the 'Perception advertisement' hypothesis, implying that the detected hunter deliberately forfeits the surprise element. Which effect prevails depends on predator evaluation of the signals involved."

Their social organization is based on family and bachelor groups. The amount of time they allocated to walking, running, lying, grazing and alert behaviour was studied in Abrapampa, north-western Argentina, during the 1988-1990 reproductive seasons. Females and yearlings spent significantly more time grazing, and less time walking, running and alert than territorial males and bachelors. This result suggests that females maximized the time spent foraging to fulfil the energetic demands of reproduction. The alertness of the territorial males increased and the grazing decreased with the number of females in the families, suggesting that males that incurred a higher cost of lost feeding time through vigilance activities increased their mating success."

Host individuals may differ in their ability to defend themselves against kleptoparasitic attacks and therefore identifying those host individuals that are particularly vulnerable to attack could both provide energetic benefits and increase the efficiency of kleptoparasitism as a foraging strategy. Here, we show that the kleptoparasitic fork-tailed drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis) specifically targets juveniles when following groups of cooperatively breeding pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor). Drongos give alarm calls upon sighting a predator, thus providing extra predator vigilance to foraging pied babblers. However, drongos also use alarm calls to steal food items. During kleptoparasitic attacks, drongos give false alarm calls and then swoop down to steal food items dropped by alarmed babblers. Juvenile pied babblers are particularly vulnerable to attack because they (a) spend a longer period handling prey items prior to consumption and (b) respond to alarm calls primarily by immediately moving to cover, in contrast to adults who respond by looking up and visually scanning the surrounding area. Drongos attack juvenile babblers significantly more often than adults, with attacks on juveniles more likely to result in the successful procurement of a food item. This patterns of attack suggests that drongos are able to differentiate between individuals of different age when targeting pied babblers, thus increasing the efficiency of kleptoparasitism as a foraging strategy."

This may lead to a temperature-mediated trade-off between anti-predator and thermoregulatory behaviour. In this study, we examine the effect of posture, orientation of the bird relative to their 'blind sector' (gap in their visual field) and temperature on the alert and escape distances of ten shorebird species (273 experimental 'approaches' by an investigator). We predicted that (1) heat-conserving postures would be associated with shorter FIDs (flight initiation distances: the distance at which the bird commenced fleeing from the investigator); (2) low temperatures would be linked to shorter FIDs; and (3) approaches from a bird's blind sector would result in shorter FIDs. Phylogenetically controlled mixed models revealed head posture (backrest or forward facing) did not significantly influence alert distance (AD) or FID. Standing on two legs was associated with longer ADs. Individual species' models revealed two significant relationships. Approaches from within the blind sector were associated with shorter ADs and FIDs in Australian Pied Oystercatcher (Haematopus longirostris), while higher temperatures were associated with shorter FIDs in Red-necked Stint (Calidris ruficollis). Despite this, we reveal no strong evidence that wild-living shorebirds trade-off antipredator capacity and thermoregulatory behaviours. However, further investigation is warranted across a wider variety of birds."

If these 2 species recognize heterospecific alarm calls, we should see antipredator behaviors similar to those displayed upon hearing a conspecific's alarm call. We broadcast single alarm calls of woodchucks, eastern chipmunks, and American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) to individuals of the first 2 species, using the territorial song of the syntopic male black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) as a control. Woodchucks became more vigilant after hearing both conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls compared with controls; however, they spent more time vigilant in response to conspecific alarm calls compared to heterospecific alarm calls. Thus, woodchucks apparently can recognize heterospecific alarm calls, but they appear to process conspecific and heterospecific calls differently. Eastern chipmunks responded to heterospecific alarm calls, but sample sizes were small and the results not definitive. Our results suggest that nonsocial mammals might benefit from eavesdropping on heterospecifics."

Collared peccaries are American tayassuids that are vulnerable to local extinction in certain areas, and conservation programs are being conducted. Captive-born peccaries are intended for release into the wild in Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil. In this study, we tested the ability of two groups of captive-born collared peccaries to recognize their predators and if they were habituated to humans. Recognition tests were performed using models of predators (canids and felids) and non-predators animals, as well as control objects, such as a plastic chair; a human was also presented to the peccaries, and tested as a separate stimulus. Anti-predator defensive responses such as fleeing and threatening displays were not observed in response to predator models. Predator detection behaviors both from visual and olfactory cues were displayed, although they were not specifically targeted at predator models. These results indicate that collared peccaries were unable to recognize model predators. Habituation effects, particularly on anti-predator behaviors, were observed both with a 1-h model presentation and across testing days. Behavioral responses to humans did not differ from those to other models. Thus, if these animals were to be released into the wild, they should undergo anti-predator training sessions to enhance their chances of survival."

This is particularly the case for monogamous species with obligate bi-parental care, where each parent should evaluate its contribution throughout the breeding season taking into account both the effort of its mate and environmental constraints. In colonial species, social environments may influence the activities of breeders. Here we compared patterns of mate effort in the Whiskered Tern Chlidonias hybrida, throughout breeding in two regions that differed greatly in colony nest density. This species builds large floating nesting platforms on aquatic plant beds. Accordingly, we explored whether nest building was sex-specific and influenced the activities of breeders throughout the season. In both regions, parental effort was indeed differentiated by sex; males invested strongly in nest-material delivery and mate provisioning during the nest-building stage, and females displayed increased investment during chick rearing. Contrary to expectations, courtship feeding and social interactions were less frequent in the region with high nest density. Our findings demonstrate that each parent clearly adjusted its reproductive effort throughout the season, whereas the contrast in social conditions between the two study regions weakly affected the activities of breeders."

We examined whether tourist traffic on a boardwalk through a Silver Gull Larus novaehollandiae breeding colony affected the birds' behaviour sufficiently to potentially decrease reproductive success. Nest density was positively correlated with distance from the boardwalk. Gulls nesting m from the boardwalk were more vigilant towards a stationary investigator than those further away. Tourists walking past breeding gulls stimulated a large increase in intra-specific aggression; stopping alongside parents with mobile chicks increased their intra-specific aggression even more. Larger tourist groups (A) stimulated more intra-specific aggression than smaller ones. An investigator walking past breeding gulls similarly stimulated an increase in intra-specific aggression, but the investigator's clothing colour, noise emission level and walking speed had no effect on the birds. An ambulatory investigator in another colony infrequently visited by people had a similar effect on gulls' intra-specific aggression, but these birds generally reacted more strongly to human intrusion. Silver Gulls' behavioural responses to tourist traffic could potentially decrease their reproductive success. These responses could be reduced by regulating traffic volume and flow and tourists' group size and behaviour, but the species' public image currently probably mitigates against such regulation occurring."

We also demonstrated quantitatively that the amount of web material consumed by the kleptoparasite is equivalent to the amount of insect material comsumed when host vigilance is low, as expected when foraging conditions are very good. Argyrodes vary in their impact on their hosts, as they may steal large prey, small prey, or silk. This host-kleptoparasite interaction is therefore an ideal system fur experimentally examining a variable producer-consumer interaction. We compare our experimental results to published experiments showing that the impact of Argyrodes on a Nephila host can be deleterious when foraging conditions are poor."

During a first series of field observations, we contrasted group size of degus when using covered microhabitats with that of degus using exposed patches. During a second set of field observations, we assessed how distance to detection and to escape by degus varied with group size upon the approach of a potential human predator. Degus in exposed patches formed larger groups than degus in covered microhabitats. After excluding the influence of nearest burrow to focal subjects, we found that degus of larger groups detected an approaching human predator at a greater distance than degus of smaller groups. Likewise, degus of larger groups escaped to nearby burrows at a greater distance from the approaching predator than degus of smaller groups. All these pieces of evidence support the predatory risk hypothesis according to which group-living in degus functions to reduce the risk of predation."

The relative importance of each period of intensive foraging on the accumulated intake varies by species, individual, and day. We studied the relative importance of each period from direct observation of radio-tagged Common Cranes (Grus grus) during winter at a site of stopover and wintering in Spain. After a mathematical model was fitted, accumulated intake showed a typical anti-sigmoid shape, with greatest increases of intake after dawn and before dusk. The rise of accumulated intake decelerated until 50% of the day length, when the trajectory inflected and accelerated according to the fitted model. The trajectory of accumulated intake in territorial families that foraged in small home ranges with food predictably available but the cost of vigilance high decelerated until 20% of the day length, then accelerated for the rest of the day. In flocking nonterritorial cranes the inflection point was delayed until 60% of the day length, as expected since flocking cranes foraged in larger home ranges with food less predictable and the cost of vigilance lower. The inflection point was delayed in early winter and advanced in late winter. The changes in the inflection points of the functions for accumulated food intake may be straightforwardly applied to daily foraging routines of other species whose rates of intake may be recorded."

While much attention has focused on quantifying attributes of harmonic vocalizations, the vocalizations of many species also may contain non-linear phenomena such as warbles, subharmonics, biphonation, and deterministic chaos or noise. The function of these non-linearities remains enigmatic. In some species, harmonic vocalizations abruptly become 'noisy' when individuals are physiologically aroused and the sudden onset of these non-linearities could signal arousal or fear to receivers. One untested functional hypothesis is that vocalizations containing non-linearities are more variable from one rendition to the next, and thus are harder to habituate to. In some situations, reducing the likelihood of habituation could be important. Signals that are highly evocative are more difficult to habituate to. Thus, we conducted playback experiments to foraging yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to determine whether the addition of white noise (a non-linear acoustic phenomenon) to alarm calls elicited a greater response than control calls without the non-linearity or control calls with silence, rather than noise, added to them. Marmots spent less time foraging after hearing calls that included noise than after normal or control calls. This result is consistent with the unpredictability hypothesis and suggests that the adaptive value of non-linearities is to prevent habituation."

Energy expenditure was estimated using time budgets and laboratory measurements of metabolism. Female parental expenditure was greatest during laying and incubation. Females took the larger share of daytime incubation, which reduced their time available for foraging (3.6 h compared with 4.8 h for males). To remain in energy balance, they required a higher food intake rate than males (97 kJ/h compared with 79 kJ/h, respectively) and consequently were likely to lose condition during incubation. Male parental expenditure was greatest during chick-rearing, especially when the young were well grown but still dependent on the male for water. The role of males as water carriers increased their energy expenditure and decreased their time available for foraging. Males also took the greater share of time spent in vigilance on behalf of the young, which further reduced their foraging time (3.2 h compared with 4.9 h for females).

We surveyed MSFs in two forest types in and around the Important Bird Area of Chitwan National Park in Nepal, between 150 and 800 m a.s.l., to provide a first description of the composition of MSFs in this area. We also aimed to understand which species should be considered 'nuclear species', important to forming MSFs or leading them forward. Results In total, we collected records on 222 MSFs that included 100 species, and 6097 individuals. The MSFs were similar to worldwide patterns in being dominated by leaf-gleaning, non-terrestrial insectivores. However, the MSFs were more dominated by canopy species than usual, and did not have a clear gregarious, understory leading species. Rather drongos (Family Dicruridae) and minivets (Family Campephagidae, Genus Pericrocotus) acted as leaders, and a cluster analysis of composition showed one group of large body size MSFs particularly characterized by the presence of the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo (Dicrurus paradiseus). Conclusions Drongos are known to provide both costs and benefits to other flock participants: they are aggressive birds that can steal food, and manipulate other species with their vocalizations, but at the same time they are 'sentinel species' that produce information about predation risk other species can use. This study demonstrates that drongos can be considered nuclear species for some types of MSFs, despite the potential costs of their presence. MSFs led by sentinel species thus may form in Asia, as well as in the Neotropics."

CA plays a fundamental role in a number of physiological processes, Such as respiration, ionic transport, acid-base regulation, and calcification. The aim of the present work was to investigate the sensitivity of this enzyme to heavy metals with a view to possible future applications of CA activity inhibition measurement in biomonitoring as either an in vitro bioassay or a biomarker. CA activity was determined by modifying a previously described electrometric method: briefly, CA activity units were calculated from the rate of H+ production in the reaction mixture (where CO2 was present as a substrate) against a blank containing the specific CA inhibitor acetazolamide. As regards the possible application as an in vitro bioassay, the sensitivity to heavy metals (cadmium, mercury, and copper) of the commercially available purified carbonic anhydrase (isozyme II) from bovine erythrocyte was tested in vitro. In Our experimental set-up, bovine CA activity was significantly inhibited by micromolar concentrations of heavy metals, showing a dose-response behaviour. As regards the possible application as biomarkers, CA was investigated in the filter-feeding Mytilus galloprovincialis, widely used in pollution-monitoring programmes as a sentinel organism. Following in vitro and in vivo exposure to 1.785 mu M cadmium chloride as a reference toxicant, mantle CA activity was significant inhibited. In conclusion. the sensitivity to chemical pollutants and low cost and simplicity of the assay method make CA activity measurement suitable for in vitro bioassay of the toxicity of environmental samples and for field biomarker applications in the sentinel organism M. galloprovincialis."

Among those, social animals are studied for one type of anti-predator defense. They aggregate in certain habitats to dilute risk, share vigilance, defend each other, and reduce their chances of being attacked. However, this tendency is not necessarily unique: solitary animals may also benefit from the presence of conspecifics. Thus, we hypothesize that even solitary animals should aggregate whenever there is safety in numbers. Additionally, this tendency to aggregate should create a risk pump, a positive feedback in aggregation because more individuals bring more safety, which brings more individuals. We also analyzed if they will aggregate in resource-rich or resource-poor environment. Aggregation in a richer and thus crowded environment implies risk pump is a stronger mechanism than competition. Aggregation in a resource-poor environment indicates the presence of risk pump, but one weaker than competition. To test the existence and direction of a risk pump in non-social animals, we compared quality between patches at different distances and population densities in three experiments. We used the most abundant gerbils of the Negev Desert: Gerbillus andersoni and G. pyramidum. Results supported the hypothesis of aggregation in the resource-poor patch for both species."

Optimistic biases were strong in control towns, but they were substantially lower, though not eliminated, in the impact towns. Several hypotheses that might explain the decrease in risk biases were examined but were not supported. Variables indicating preoccupation with the threat (frequency of thoughts, vigilance, intrusive thoughts) stood out as the only variables closely tied to individuals' personal experiences during and after the tornado, Judgments of tornado risk magnitude may be constructed on the spot to answer survey questions; whereas preoccupation measures may better reveal respondents' actual ongoing disaster experience."

Understanding its biology and its early detection based on its behaviour is essential for its successful management and eradication. This study demonstrates the potential of the canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) product retrieved from remote sensing datasets to detect early bark beetle infestations in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Time series CCC maps were generated through radiative transfer model inversion of images from RapidEye and Sentinel-2 (2011-2018). The CCC products were then classified into stressed and healthy classes using calculated CCC mean and variance values obtained for infected and healthy Norway spruce trees in 2016. The location of infected plots obtained from the interoperation of resolution (0.1 m) aerial photographs was used as reference data to validate the accuracy of the infestation maps generated from CCC. Validation of the infestation maps indicated a classification accuracy of up to 78%. Our results demonstrated that CCC products derived from satellite remote sensing data were a rigorous proxy for early detection of bark beetle infestation. Hence, CCC products may play a significant role in understanding the dynamics of the Infestation and improving the management of bark beetle outbreaks in forest ecosystems. Inclusion of other remotely sensed plant traits as additional parameters in the model, such as dry matter and nitrogen, may further improve the accuracy of early detection of bark beetle infestation using satellite remote sensing."

Satellite SAR interferometry capabilities for the evaluation of ground movements allows the monitoring of intensive surface mine subsidence and can provide new knowledge about the risks in the mining industry. This work integrates both conventional and advanced Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) to study the ground subsidence in the Legnica Glogow Copper District (LGCD, Poland) by processing about 400 Sentinel-1 images from October 2014 to April 2019. Even without field data and information on past and ongoing excavation activities, the DInSAR approach allowed us to identify 30 troughs of subsidence, ranging from 500 m to 2.5 km in diameter, which in some cases, took place several times during the analyzed time span. The cumulative subsidence in 4 years and 7 months exceeds 70 cm in several zones of the LGCD. The sub-centimetric precision achieved by advanced analysis (A-DInSAR), allowed us to monitor the real extent of the mining influence area on the surface, with deformation velocities of up to 50 mm/year. The ground deformation detected at LGCD can be due to both mining-induced tremors and roof subsidence above the underground excavation rooms. As deformations do not occur concurrently with tremors, this can be related to excavation activities or to degradation of abandoned mines."

Cleaning continues until the recipient ('cleanee') rejects the cleaning or the cleaner ceases cleaning. In cases where the recipient did not reject the cleaning, the cleanee often retreated to its own burrow site after the cleaner ceased cleaning, allowing the cleaner to feed on its territory. We suggest that this is mutual cooperation, in which the cleaner assists the recipient to clean the body surface, and the recipient in return provides a feeding ground for the cleaner. Using field observation, we explored the factors responsible for the retreat of the cleanee in response to the cleaning behavior. Factors influencing the retreat of the cleanee were the time of the cleaning incident relative to low tide, the cleanee's position relative to its own burrow, and the duration of the cleaning bout. The third factor showed that retreat was more common when the cleaning was thorough, which suggests that allocleaning is a form of mutual cooperation in M. banzai."

These results suggest that perceivers, especially chronically jealous perceivers, are sensitive to their partners' temptation for extradyadic relations and respond to this temptation with relationship-protective behaviors. Furthermore, perceivers' mate-guarding behaviors predicted increases in targets' subsequent daily commitment, suggesting that perceivers' mate guarding works to deter targets from future infidelity by increasing targets' commitment to the relationship.

In addition, Studies 4, 5, and 6 showed that goal-related accessibility and post-fulfillment inhibition were proportional to the goal's expectancy, the goal's value, and their interaction. Together, these studies support the notion that goals enhance accessibility of the goal-related constructs, which is maintained as long as the goal is active, goal fulfillment inhibits accessibility of goal-related constructs, and these effects are proportional to the strength of the motivation.

The growth was isometric with no significant difference in the carapace growth for male and female crabs for both sites. There was significant difference in the crab size at Korangi creek, which was smaller than Sandspit. The estimated size at onset of sexual maturity in females was greater than that of males at both study sites. In female, the abdominal width showed positive allometric growth related to reproductive advantages forming the incubatory chamber.

During a target-detection task in which emotional and neutral facial expressions were used as cues, participants received performance feedback intended to elicit a negative emotional reaction that rendered the task either threatening or not threatening to self-concept. When the task was perceived to threaten self-concept, repressors distanced themselves by rapidly disengaging their attention from the facial expressions rather than by slowly shifting or not shifting their attention to the facial expressions. Attentional disengagement was accompanied by sympathetic nervous system activity suggestive of a defense response. This research provides further insight into the nature and consequences of the interplay of dispositional tendencies, situational contexts, and higher order cognitive influences in attentional behavior.

Factors eliciting displacement and the nutritional consequences of behavioral changes were measured. GPS collars were deployed to track temporal and spatial resource use and scan and focal observations were used to quantify foraging efficiency, Vigilance behavior, and bear use of various food resources. Total food intake was quantified by combining data on food resource use based on GPS locations and foraging efficiency was measured using spotting scopes from long distances. Seasonal food availability and quality were monitored and utilized as co-variates in comparisons between pre-treatment and treatment years. Though the bear population exhibited significant behavioral differences between the presence and absence of humans, changes in behavior generally mediated effects on total food intake. Adult males at a salt marsh viewing area were the only sex/age class exhibiting reduced food intake resulting from a 15% decline in foraging time when viewers were present. Salmon intake did not differ between pre-treatment and treatment years despite a 10% decline in time spent fishing when viewers were present. The tightly controlled experimental bear-viewing introduced in this study allowed bears to evaluate predation risk associated with human activity and optimally respond to minimize costs due to changes in foraging activities.

Sentinel-2 MSI TOA Level 1C reflectance images were used to remotely estimate the concentration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), the main indicator of the trophic state of aquatic environments, in five reservoirs in the state of Ceara, Brazil. A three-spectral band retrieval model was calibrated using 171 water samples, collected from November 2015 through July 2018 in 5 reservoirs. For validation, 71 additional samples, collected from August 2018 through December 2019, were used to ensure a robust accuracy assessment. The TOA Level 1C products performed very well, achieving a relative RMSE of 28% and R-2 = 0.80. Data on wind direction and speed, solar radiation and reservoir volume were used to generate a conceptual model to analyze the behavior of chl-a in the surface waters of the Castanhao reservoir. During 2019, the reservoir water quality showed strong variation, with concentration fluctuating from 30 to 95 mu g/L We showed that the end of the dry season is marked by strong eutrophic conditions corresponding to very low water inflows into the reservoir. During the rainy season there is a large decrease in the chl-a concentration following the increase of the lake water storage. During the following dry season, satellite data show a progressive improvement of the trophic state controlled by wind intensity that promotes a better mixing of the reservoir waters and inhibiting the development of most phytoplankton."

Parasite-defence grooming is regulated both by a central control mechanism (programmed grooming model) and by cutaneous stimulation from bites (stimulus-driven model). To study the evolution of parasite-defence grooming in ungulates, we compared species-typical grooming behaviour with host morphology and habitat to test predictions of the programmed grooming model while taking into account phylogenetic relatedness. We observed grooming in 60 ungulate species at ectoparasite-free zoological parks in which the confound of differential tick exposure was controlled for and stimulus-driven grooming was ruled out. Concentrated-changes tests indicated that sexually dimorphic grooming (in which breeding males groom less than females) has coevolved with sexual body size dimorphism, suggesting that intrasexual selection has favoured reduced grooming that enhances vigilance of males for oestrous females and rival males. Concentrated-changes tests also revealed that the evolution of complex oral grooming (involving alternate use of both teeth and tongue) and adult allogrooming (whereby conspecifics oral groom body regions not accessible by self grooming) was concentrated in lineages inhabiting closed woodland or forest habitat associated with increased tick exposure, with such advanced grooming being most concentrated in Cervidae. Regression analyses of independent contrasts indicated that both host body size and habitat play a role in the evolution of species-typical oral grooming rates, as previously reported. These results indicate that the observed grooming represents centrally driven grooming patterns favoured by natural selection in each lineage. This is the first phylogenetically controlled comparative study to report the evolution of parasite-defence grooming behaviours in response to selection pressures predicted by the programmed grooming hypothesis.

We manipulated both factors by means of predator fecal scents and ungulate exclosures. We hypothesized that high-risk perception and ungulate presence would promote acorn dispersal. In the former case, it would stimulate acorn mobilization to safe microhabitats rather than in situ consumption. In the latter, increased competition for acorns would promote their storage for later consumption. We also expected that mice would adapt their foraging behavior to previous experience modulating the strength of these effects.In the presence of ungulates, mice focused their foraging activities on food acquisition at the expenses of vigilant behaviors. However, a more efficient foraging did not entail enhanced dispersal services. Lack of anti-predatory cover in tree surroundings may have deterred mice from transporting seeds outside canopies. Increased risk interacted with previous experience. In control trees (no predator odor), mice confidence increased throughout the night resulting in decreased vigilance and enhanced acorn mobilization rates. In contrast, in risky conditions (trees with predator odor) mice maintained a base-line vigilant behavior. Contrary to our expectations, increased risk did not result in higher acorn mobilization, but the opposite. Again, the scarcity of safe microhabitats for mobilization may have been the underlying cause of this behavior.Our results show that successful acorn dispersal depends, at least partly, on plant-animal relationships that are beyond the oak-rodent mutualism. Thus, any conservation policy aimed at restoring natural regeneration of oaks should take into account the interaction network in which oak-rodent encounters are embedded. In addition, they suggest that mice incorporate direct and indirect cues of risks (habitat structure) through recent experience. A better understanding of this process will improve our ability to incorporate such temporal and spatial variability in models of acorn dispersal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."

After detecting a predator, primates can produce alarm calls, show predator-specific escape strategies or even mob the predator. It remains unclear how solitary nocturnal primates respond to diurnal predation pressure while they sleep or rest. The aim of this study was to investigate the diurnal anti-predator behaviour of the nocturnal and solitary Sahamalaza sportive lemur, Lepilemur sahamalazensis, which regularly rests in exposed locations. We observed the responses of 32 Sahamalaza sportive lemurs to playbacks of territorial calls of an aerial predator (Madagascar harrier hawk), mating calls of a terrestrial predator (fossa), and the contact calls of a medium-sized bird (crested coua) as a control, at different diurnal sleeping sites. Lemurs never showed a flight response after replays of predator or control calls, but regularly froze after harrier hawk calls. Lemurs scanned the sky immediately after playback of harrier hawk calls, and the ground or trees after fossa calls. Lemur vigilance increased significantly after both predator calls. After crested coua calls the animals became significantly less vigilant, suggesting that contact calls of this bird serve as indicators of predator absence. We found no response differences between different types of sleeping sites. Our results show that resting Sahamalaza sportive lemurs recognise predator vocalisations as indicators of increased predation risk, discern vocalizations of different predators, and employ anti-predator behaviours specific for different predator classes. Their behavioural responses while resting or sleeping are comparable to those of active primates, and their response rate of 80% shows that this solitary and nocturnal primate is constantly aware of its environment."

A classical biocontrol programme is under development using the egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus. Widespread implementation of biocontrol requires efficient mass rearing, which is constrained by the availability of fresh H. halys eggs. In this study, parasitism rate, developmental time, sex ratio and size were compared between wasps reared on fresh versus frozen, newly laid (<1 d old) versus variably aged (0-3 d old), and frozen egg masses stored <= 4 y. Frozen eggs yielded 56-65% fewer wasps, with parasitism rate decreasing 1-3% per month stored. Parasitism rate, sex ratio and developmental time were comparable between newly laid and variably aged eggs. Freezing eggs for any duration did not affect sex ratio or weight of emerged wasps, but delayed emergence 5-6 d. To simulate deployment of sentinel eggs in the field, we incubated frozen eggs at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C for 1-9 d before exposing them to T. japonicus, then evaluated parasitism trends. Trissolcus japonicus parasitism rate decreased 5-8% per day incubated, unhatched wasps increased 9% per day incubated and sex ratio was not impacted. Variably aged, frozen and longer stored eggs can be used for T. japonicus rearing and experimentation without affecting emerged wasp sex ratio or size within one generation, but have lower parasitism and slower development. Frozen sentinel eggs are effective <3-5 d, especially in hot conditions."

Individuals of the two species associate for thermoregulatory basking on rock outcrops (koppies) and, in the Matobo National Park, Zimbabwe, frequently constitute heterospecific groups that produce offspring synchronously. Exposure to predators during basking is thought to put a high premium on vigilance, particularly during the presence of dependent offspring in nurseries. We predicted, therefore, an increase in the association of the two species of hyraxes when offspring were present because this would lead to larger groups, thus enhancing the ability to detect predators. Koppie aggregations of hyraxes were classified as homospecific or heterospecific according to basking group composition. Heterospecific association increased when offspring were present, and heterospecific groups were larger than homospecific ones. Fifty-one percent of nurseries were heterospecific for adults/subadults. During the pre-weaning phase (<2 months after birth), 85% of P. capensis and 65% of H. brucei juveniles were in nurseries of heterospecific basking groups. Heterospecific groups had more offspring than homospecific groups. Juvenile mortality is most evident after young are weaned and heterospecific associations break down. Heterospecific aggregation, through increased group size, may result in a higher probability of avoiding predators, thereby reducing the vulnerability of young."

Little is known about its foraging ecology and current trapping methods and monitoring systems are ineffective at commercial scales. In semi-field studies, we evaluated adult alightment and ovipositional preference within and among raspberry plants using sentinel Tangletrap-coated and clean raspberry fruit, respectively, positioned within the exterior and interior plant canopy at four different heights (60, 85, 110 and 135 cm from the base) and conducted in field cages using sexually mature adults. Alightment of adults on Tangle-trap-coated fruit indicated a preference for fruit positioned at lower heights and/or interior locations based on significantly greater numbers being captured on sentinel sticky-coated berries at the two lowest heights. Oviposition in clean raspberry fruit also yielded a similar pattern. In mark-release-recapture studies conducted in the field, spotted wing drosophila prefer sentinel sticky fruit positioned on exterior rows as they alighted on these berries in significantly greater numbers than fruit at in the central portion of the plot. Likewise, in field trials with wild fly populations, infestations were significantly greater in edge rows compared with interior rows. Collectively, our results suggest that monitoring and behaviorally based management strategies may be more effective if they target adults foraging in the lower canopy of small fruit plants located on the crop perimeter."

Despite the potential interest of O. rudnevi as a native parasitoid, the knowledge of its biology remains very limited. We used sentinel eggs to assess the distribution of O. rudnevi in Extremadura (southwest Spain) and to explore its ecology, phenology, behavior, parasitism rates, and host preference. More than 13 500 sentinel eggs, housed in 1 030 wood disks, were field-exposed during 2016-2018 in 147 oak stands over an array of oak forests. Oobius rudnevi was the only egg parasitoid detected, being widespread and relatively abundant over the studied area (90/147 stands, 61.2%) with adults flying in May-July. Parasitoids were detected in both host species, but net parasitism (P-N) was significantly higher in C. cerdo (22.4%) than in C. welensii (9.5%). Net parasitism was affected by altitude (it was higher at 600-800 m) and tended to increase in colder aspects; P-N was poorly related to host egg density (no. eggs per disk) and unrelated to host population size (no. adults per trap). Most parasitoids overwintered and emerged in the following spring (synchronously with their hosts) but some phenotypes/lineages did not undergo obligate diapause and were bivoltine. Bivoltine wasps were spatially widespread (27/90 stands, 30%), even if their actual prevalence was rather low (60/1641 parasitized eggs, 3.7%). We also found that O. rudnevi was slightly protogynous, the sex ratio was female-biased, and the mean (+/- SEM) number of wasps emerging per parasitized egg was 9.3 +/- 0.1 (range 1-29). We discuss the potential role of O. rudnevi as a biological control agent from an evolutionary perspective."

We used controlled indoor experiments to investigate the ability of red knots to discern between high- and low-threat encounters with a representative predator, the sparrowhawk. The behaviour of knots was compared across three conditions: no predators present (very low predation threat), presentation of a perching sparrowhawk model (low predation threat) and presentation of a gliding sparrowhawk model (high predation threat). In all behavioural parameters measured, red knots showed evidence of discriminating between the different levels of predation risk. Knots responded immediately to the presence of sparrowhawks with escape flights, and the duration of escape flights was longer following the gliding sparrowhawk events than following perching events. Similarly, the proportion of time spent vigilant increased with increasing level of predation threat, while the proportion of time spent feeding decreased. These results show that knots recognize variations in the level of predation threat, and adjust their antipredator responses accordingly. Furthermore, model sparrowhawks were introduced into the experimental arena at similar distances to the knots, which suggests that knots are able to use cues other than distance to predator to gauge the immediate level of threat that a predator poses.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been extensively studied to characterize drowsiness; nevertheless, its behavior with respect to accurately annotated drowsy periods remains to be investigated. At present, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and psychomotor vigilance task are widely used references for subjective drowsiness analysis. However, their practical application in real-time monitoring of alertness is limited. To address this limitation, we combined Seeing Machines driver monitoring system and electrooculogram (EOG) for localization of microsleep (MS) events and studied EEG spectral behavior during MS events. EEG, EOG, and facial behavior data were recorded simultaneously from 16 commercially rated pilots during simulated flight. Relative spectral power in delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) in frontal, central, temporal, parietal, and occipital brain regions was analyzed. Compared to baseline, delta power reduced during MS (p < 0.05 in all regions), alpha power increased during MS (p < 0.001 in all regions), while theta and beta powers did not change ( p > 0.05). The research findings highlight the capability of EEG delta and alpha spectrum toward characterizing MS events; therefore, with consideration to user acceptability, application toward drowsiness detection is plausible via EEG electrodes embedded in the typical aviation headset."
"Halupka, Konrad; Osinska-Dzienniak, Anna",Group foraging by wintering rooks: combined effects of safety and energy requirements,BEHAVIOUR,150,381,395,10.1163/1568539X-00003057,2013,"We report the results of feeding experiments with free-ranging gregarious corvids, rooks (Corvus frugilegus), at varying ambient temperatures and risk of interruption. Feeding behaviour depended on the photoperiod and the interaction between ambient temperature and safety of the feeder. Birds did not trade off safety for increasing food intake; instead their behaviour became more risk-averse during short photoperiods or low ambient temperatures, when energy requirements were presumably the highest. We propose that rooks are not severely limited by food supply and, when environmental conditions deteriorate, can quickly increase body reserves. The added fat load, however, handicaps their ability to escape from a danger, thus increasing risk aversion. Only the rooks which initiated foraging were sensitive to safety of the feeder and similar reactions were not observed among birds which joined later. We suggest that rooks, while foraging gregariously, rely on the 'safety in numbers' effect, which enhances feeding success. Some other observations also supported this hypothesis. Thus, food intake by small groups of foragers was higher on 'safe' than on 'risky' feeders, but this pattern was reversed with increasing group size. This suggests that individuals in a large group can reduce scanning for predators and focus their attention on collecting food. An increased feeding rate allows the time exposed to danger to be shortened. Foraging behaviour of birds showed greater synchronisation at risky places than at safe ones. This might be a reaction to the increased costs of feeding, which is predicted by theoretical models of group foraging by selfish individuals."

We also reddened epaulets of free-living territorial males to determine whether manipulated and control males differ in territorial behavior, mating success, or reproductive success. Compared with control males, males with reddened epaulets incurred elevated rates of trespassing and territorial challenges, lost their territories more often, and were unable to produce extra-pair offspring. Despite these differences, however, the realized reproductive success of experimental and control males did not differ significantly, perhaps because males with reddened epaulets devoted more time to anti-predator vigilance and were more aggressive toward a simulated predator than were control males. An apparent lack of current sexual selection on epaulet color may be a form of counter-balancing sexual selection in which male aggression against redder epaulets opposes female preference for redder epaulets, or it might be the result of males compensating for lost extra-pair fertilizations by increasing their parental care."
"Suraci, Justin P.; Roberts, Devin J.; Clinchy, Michael; Zanette, Liana Y.",Fearlessness towards extirpated large carnivores may exacerbate the impacts of naive mesocarnivores,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,28,439,447,10.1093/beheco/arw178,2017,"By suppressing mesocarnivore foraging, the fear large carnivores inspire can be critical to mitigating mesocarnivore impacts. Where large carnivores have declined, mesocarnivores may quantitatively increase foraging, commensurate with reductions in fear. The extirpation of large carnivores may further exacerbate mesocarnivore impacts by causing qualitative changes in mesocarnivore behavior. Error management theory suggests that, where predators are present, prey should be biased towards over-responsiveness to predator cues, abandoning foraging in response to both predator cues and benign stimuli mistaken for predator cues (false-positives). Where predators are absent, prey may avoid these foraging costs by becoming unresponsive (naive) to both predator cues and false-positives. If naivete occurs in mesocarnivores where large carnivores have been extirpated, it could substantively exacerbate their impacts, as fearless mesocarnivores may engage in virtually unrestricted foraging. We tested the naivete of raccoons (Procyon lotor) to extirpated large carnivores in the context of a larger experiment demonstrating that fear of large carnivores can mediate mesocarnivore impacts. Raccoon responsiveness to playbacks of their extirpated large carnivore predators (cougars, Puma concolor; bears, Ursus americanus) was significantly less than to the only extant large carnivore predator (dogs), and was no greater than to non-predators (seals; Phoca vitulina, Eumetopias jubatus). Raccoons failed to recognize their now extirpated predators as threatening, spending as much time foraging as when hearing non-predators, which we estimate has substantive impacts, based on results from the larger experiment. We discuss the potentially powerful role of fearlessness in exacerbating mesocarnivore impacts in systems where large carnivores have been lost."

POYSA H,ECOLOGY OF FORAGING BEHAVIOUR IN DABBLING DUCKS ANAS-SPP,Joensuun Yliopiston Luonnontieteellisia Julkaisuja,,1,19,,1987,"This review summrizes the results of six papers on the foraging ecology and behaviour of dabbling ducks (Anas spp.) by the author, gives some new information and outlines some aspects for further research in the light of competition and optimal foraging theories. The main aspects considered are: 1) general foraging strategies and their morphological adaptations and constraints: 2) interspecific foraging interactions at the community level and among dabbling ducks; 3) intraspecific foraging interactions with respect to some hypothesized foraging and antipredator consequences of grouping; 4) the relationship between foraging and predation risk. The last two aspects were studied in the teal (Anas crecca). The following main conclusions emerged: Dabbling ducks are flexible in their foraging, some species being, however, better adapted to surface feeding and others to feeding at deeper water layers. Body size, neck length and bill morphology importantly affect foraging strategies used by different species. Foraging interactions between dabbling ducks and other waterfowl species should in general be of minor importance. Among dabbling ducks, both negative and positive species interactions may modify foraging in mixed groups. Group foraging in the teal acts as an adaptation to exploit temporally and spatially variable feeding environments rather than as an adaptation to reduce the risk of predation. However, harmful second-order effects may reduce feeding efficiency in large groups. Feeding and vigilance are mutually exclusive activities in dabbling ducks that use feeding methods where the eyes are beneath the water surface. Teals seem to sacrifice vigilance as foraging demands increase. However, in the presence of predators, teals sacrifice feeding efficiency by increasing the proportion of time spent scanning at the expense of feeding time."
"Beauchamp, Guy",Does sun glare increase antipredator behaviour in prey?,JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY,48,591,595,10.1111/jav.01154,2017,"As the sun gradually lowers over the horizon, prey species with more sun in their eyes should have more difficulty in visually monitoring their surroundings for threats and thus experience a higher predation risk. In a unique setting, I could examine changes in antipredator behaviour in a prey species, the semipalmated sandpiper Calidris pusilla, facing attacks by peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus, which originated from the general direction of the lowering sun. I predicted gradual changes in antipredator behaviour as sun glare becomes more problematic later in the day. As the day progressed, sandpipers occurred in sparser groups when the sun glared but not when clouds obscured the sun, suggesting that fewer individuals engaged in risky foraging. Pecking rate and foraging success decreased later in the day when the sun glared but not otherwise implying an increase in vigilance at the expense of foraging. When more sun hit their eyes, sandpipers also moved faster suggesting increased skittishness. The sun glare effect might be relevant to any species foraging in open areas not only when the sun sets but also when it rises especially if predators can target prey species at these vulnerable times. The temporal gradient in predation risk that the sun glare effect creates might thus apply broadly and have important consequences for antipredator vigilance, foraging efficiency, and habitat use."
"Huang, Ping; Sieving, Kathryn E.; St Mary, Colette M.",Heterospecific information about predation risk influences exploratory behavior,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,23,463,472,10.1093/beheco/arr212,2012,"Use of socially derived information from other species is common in many types of decision making, but particularly in predation avoidance. In communities with diverse prey that share generalist predators, public information concerning predator location, type, or activity is often used by heterospecifics. Given that exploration and exploitation of the environment is constrained by predator avoidance, exactly how information about predators affects subsequent prey behavior is of increasing interest. In this study, we tested how social information (predation threat encoded in antipredator vocalizations of the tufted titmouse, Baeolophus bicolor) influences the exploratory behavior (movement, vigilance, and space use) of Northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis). Cardinals, placed inside a small flight cage equipped with an array of perches, experienced randomly assigned playback treatments of titmouse antipredator vocalizations that varied in threat level. Exploratory behavior was videotaped during 3 periods-Before (B), During (D), and After (A) playbacks of titmouse calls. When titmouse vocalizations encoding more dangerous and immediate predation threats were played, cardinals significantly reduced active movements but increased visual scanning relative to subjects hearing calls that encoded low threat levels. Furthermore, they were also slower to return to prethreat behavior. Thus, we conclude that cardinals interpreted the antipredator signals correctly and responded accordingly, adjusting their activities to potentially reduce risk (decreasing movement and increasing vigilance). Our work demonstrates specifically how the trade-off between exploration (comprised of both movement and sensory scanning) and predator avoidance is actuated via spatial decision making in the cardinal."
"Wingelmaier, Katja; Winkler, Hans; Nemeth, Erwin",Reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) males sing an 'all-clear' signal to their incubating females,BEHAVIOUR,144,195,206,10.1163/156853907779947319,2007,"While sexual functions of birdsong have been intensively investigated, non-sexual functions have received less attention. After pair formation males may sing to communicate with their established mates. Song aimed at incubating and feeding females could serve as an 'all-clear' signal, showing that there is no risk of predation and that it is safe for the female to exit the nest or to feed the young. Females should therefore preferentially leave nests when mates are singing nearby. Additionally, a vigilant male near the nest site could protect the brood from potential risks like predation and females could stay away longer for foraging. In this study, we investigated aspects of male singing activity of reed buntings (Emberiza schoeniclus) during incubation and feeding of nestlings after pair formation. Exits of incubating females from the nest occurred significantly more often than expected during male song output. When their mates were singing at high rates, females stayed away longer for incubation breaks. During the nestling period we found a high variation in male song output. Males that sang more fed their young significantly less. This suggests that time devoted to singing limits other activities such as feeding of offspring. Male reed buntings could choose different strategies for paternal investment: They either feed at high rates or they sing more to signal their vigilance. Another reason for this trade-off might be a conflict between paternal investment and territory defence or extrapair behaviour. However, even if male song after pairing has additional sexual functions, we suggest that non-sexually selected functions may be more common than expected."
"Yasue, M; Quinn, JL; Cresswell, W",Multiple effects of weather on the starvation and predation risk trade-off in choice of feeding location in Redshanks,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,17,727,736,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2003.00783.x,2003,"1. Animals should choose the feeding habitat that allows them to meet their energy requirements while minimizing predation risk, but as weather becomes more severe, animals may choose riskier, but more profitable, feeding habitats.2. At the Tyninghame estuary, Scotland, Redshanks (Tringa totanus) chose to feed on either a mudflat or saltmarsh. Energy intake rates were 23% higher and thermoregulatory costs were 40% lower on the saltmarsh, but predation risk from sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) was 21 times higher.3. The investigation tested whether the riskier habitat was chosen only when weather conditions were such that individuals were unable to meet their energy requirements in the safer habitat, and how any additional effects of weather affected this choice.4. When starvation risk increased on the mudflat, more Redshanks selected the saltmarsh where energy budgets alone accounted for 22% of the variation in habitat choice. Temperature and wind may have had smaller additional, independent effects that were probably related to their effects on vigilance behaviour and predator detection.5. The results show that weather may be crucial in determining habitat choice through its direct effects on starvation and predation risk, and the importance of considering a wide range of weather conditions when determining habitat requirements."

However, patterns of eavesdropping among species may be shaped by the reliability of the intercepted information, that is, the degree to which the alarm call represents a pertinent threat to the eavesdropping species ('relevance'). Prey are predicted to respond strongly to alarm calls from species that are attacked by the same predator guild, whereas species consumed by a larger or different subset of the carnivore community may act as a less reliable source of predator information. We used a playback experiment to examine whether the degree of antipredator responses to heterospecific alarm calls varied with the reliability of the calling species in three large African mammals: impala, Aepyceros melampus, common wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, and plains zebra, Equus quagga. Alarm calls of all three species were broadcast randomly to herds of their own species or to either of the other two species. In accordance with the reliability hypothesis, we found that all species reacted strongly to zebra alarm calls. Lions are the primary predator of zebra and represent a significant threat to all three prey species. In contrast, impala are consumed by a greater number of predators, and their alarm calls evoked weaker, mixed responses in the other two species.

Predation cues can stem either from the predator or from conspecifics and indicate different predation risk levels, thus eliciting different anti-predation responses. The three-spined stickleback is a well-studied fish species often found in gregarious formations. Previous studies show that sticklebacks perform a variety of anti-predation behaviours; however, little is known about how they respond to multiple simultaneous predator cues, characteristic of heterogeneous natural habitats. Here, we experimentally compare the relative importance of three types of predation cues (visual predator cue, chemical predator odour cue and chemical alarm cue from injured conspecifics) and their interactions, on anti-predation and foraging behaviour of sticklebacks. Results showed that (1) individual sticklebacks responded most strongly to visual predator cues, which resulted in reduced foraging activity, increased spine erection and increased predator inspection; (2) the presence of chemical cues (predator odour and/or conspecific alarm cues) stimulates freezing behaviour to a minor extent; and (3) anti-predation behaviour manifests as a trade-off with foraging-related activities. Overall, the results indicate that sticklebacks could assess risk and modify their behavioural responses depending on which cues are present in the environment. The experimental approach of using factorial combinations of different predatory cues can increase our understanding of the role of multimodal cues in aquatic ecosystems."

In cooperative breeders, where nonbreeding individuals assist in raising offspring, these 'helpers' are expected to increase the fitness of breeders and hence empirical research has focused on the effect they have on reproductive output and breeder survival. However, the effects of helpers during the postfledging period are poorly known because of the difficulty of tracking fledglings in the wild. Helper presence might be beneficial for fledglings, for example through continuous food delivery or increased predator vigilance, but potential competition between helpers and fledglings, or changes in investment of parents assisted by helpers, could counteract these positive effects and have a negative influence on postfledging survival probabilities or promote dispersal. We investigated the survival of juvenile sociable weavers, Philetairus socius, raised in pairs alone versus pairs with helpers by using capture-mark-recapture methods to control for individual detectability in survival estimation. We found that local survival in the first year was reduced in young raised by groups versus those raised by pairs. This may reflect either higher mortality or emigration of juveniles raised in groups. Hence, our study reveals significant postfledging effects of cooperative breeding that have not been reported previously and that need to be investigated in studies addressing the evolution of cooperative breeding.

We employed an experimental design to measure the heart rate and behaviour of Royal penguins on Macquarie Island, Australia, in response to a single pedestrian visit using the current recommended approach distance of 5 m for visitors. Penguins showed increased heart rate (1.23 times average resting heart rate) and vigilance (six-fold increase), suggested to be a precursor to a flight or fight response, however, no penguins fled their nests. These responses were significantly greater than observed during Subantarctic skua overflights, suggesting incubating Royal penguins viewed a single pedestrian at 5 m as a greater threat than a predator overflight. Single persons using the current minimum approach guideline when visiting incubating Royal penguins appear unlikely to elicit responses considered greater than minor or transitory, consistent with activities that are considered acceptable by current management arrangements on Macquarie Island. However, applying this guideline requires caution because the cumulative impacts of visitation are unknown and greater responses may occur with larger group sizes or during different breeding phases. We consider minimum approach distance guidelines should be based on the separation distance necessary to allow animals to undertake normal activity, rather than on the distance people can approach wildlife before the animals flee.

Swamp rabbits deposited >91% of their fecal pellets on logs. A greater density of pellets were found in February 1992 compared to other months. Length, height, diameter, decay class, and percent cover of moss on logs used as latrines by swamp rabbits were recorded. Logistic regression was used to predict the Likelihood that a log would be used as a latrine. Increasing decay class, percentage cover of moss, and diameter of logs were correlated with latrines of swamp rabbits. Height of logs did not distinguish between used and unused logs, but length and season were significant predictors of use of logs as latrines in forests of mature bottomland hardwood and cut-over bottomland. Spatial clumping of latrines and peak use during breeding were consistent with the hypothesis that latrines on logs serve as territorial markers. An alternative hypothesis that swamp rabbits elevated themselves on logs to increase their field of view and coincidentally deposited pellets on logs was tested experimentally with three obstruction treatments; visual + physical, only physical, and a control. Treatments were placed on I-m sections of 54 logs that had been used as latrines in at least 2 of the 4 monthly surveys. Surveys conducted for 4 months after the installation of obstructions showed a significant interaction between use of a log as a latrine, treatment type, and month of survey."

Experimental manipulations were used to examine how tolerant red bishops were towards foreign eggs. Red bishops did not discriminate mimetic cuckoo-sized models on the basis of egg size, an increase in clutch size or the stage at which the parasite egg appeared in the nest. Only eggs that were heavily maculated or had a darker ground colour and were quite unlike the host's light-blue eggs, were significantly rejected. Low rates of rejection (11.1%) of cuckoo-egg models may be a consequence of evolutionary lag in a coevolutionary arms race between host and parasite. Since the cuckoo egg is a good mimic the cost to a red bishop of making a mistake in the closed nest and rejecting an 'own' egg may constrain rates of egg rejection. The parasite may be unable to exploit this constraint because corporate vigilance and defence of large colonies probably prevents any significant parasitism from taking place in a population; rates of interspecific parasitism were negatively correlated with colony size. The potential exists for an evolutionary equilibrium between host and parasite in which the parasite can exploit breeders only in small, low density and poorly defended colonies.

Taking advantage of the availability of radar data, we describe a methodology used to detect the river's water surface flooding patterns and the size of floods using observations from Sentinel-1 imagery. With the proposed methodology, characteristics of the river's normal average riverbed surface are determined, as well as the flood footprint. As a case study, it shows the annual and interannual water variability at the lower Coatzacoalcos Basin in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. This site was chosen after considering the evidence of seasonal flooding and the changes that happened during the 2015 to 2017 period. Our paper details the results on surface changes during this time period. The results on water surface cover have been validated through different sources of information to confirm the ability to differentiate flood areas and know the maximum flood extensions. An agreement above 92% is estimated to be reached with the use of the evaluated maps of binary water/no-water. Recurrent flood areas were detected where water remained during one or several weeks during the month of October, both in 2015 and 2017. Finally, a change in the extent of water maps in the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals is achieved with the integration of historical data over time and space of the natural behavior of the rivers in the case study.

"Cherry, Michael J.; Warren, Robert J.; Conner, L. Mike",Fire-mediated foraging tradeoffs in white-tailed deer,ECOSPHERE,8,,,10.1002/ecs2.1784,2017,"Predation risk can induce individual prey to express behavioral, physiological, and morphological traits that can influence population-level processes. Maternal care is an intuitive link between predator-mediated traits of individuals and population-level processes because maternal investment can decrease with predation risk, and often influences processes such as neonatal growth, survival, and recruitment. During fawn-rearing, many ungulate species restrict space use to a fraction of their home range. Selection of and within these areas can influence the quality of concealment cover for fawns and forage availability during early lactation which is the peak of maternal investment. Fire influences the distribution of food resources and cover for prey and their predators. In frequently burned systems, ungulates typically move into recently burned areas to exploit increased forage quality and detection of predators that use cover to stalk their prey. We investigated the effects of time since fire on the selection of and within fawn-rearing areas and foraging behavior in white-tailed deer in a frequently burned pine savanna. White-tailed deer selected woodlands with greater time since fire and avoided recently burned areas, likely sacrificing forage quality for concealment cover during fawn-rearing. We then used camera data to test the effects of time since fire on foraging behavior and found that with increased time since fire female white-tailed deer are more likely to be feeding while foraging at concentrated resources of standardized quality and quantity. By combining these data, we revealed that the counterintuitive avoidance of high-quality forage in recently burned areas can be explained by predation risk. We documented fire effects on proactive (i.e., avoidance of recent burns) and reactive (decreased vigilance with increasing time since fire) antipredator behaviors in white-tailed deer during the fawning season. Our results suggest that fire can spatially and temporally alter a landscape causing dynamic predation risk to which prey must respond to maximize fitness."

Habituation may be involved in acquiring tolerance of human proximity, in which case tolerance should vary with the degree of opportunity to learn that most humans do not present a threat and should therefore vary with human population density. We studied Common Mynas (Acridotheres tristis) in the urban, suburban, peri-urban and surrounding rural zones of Melbourne, Australia, to determine whether flight-initiation distance (FID) and time allocated to anti-predator vigilance increased along this gradient from the urban to the rural zone. This gradient encompassed a 143-fold variation in average human population density during daylight hours. Urban and suburban Mynas had a 2.3-5.7 times shorter FID, were 1.6-2.5 times less likely to retreat by flying and were 1.9-3.1 times more likely to flee >5 m than their peri-urban and rural conspecifics. Fleeing behaviour was not strongly correlated with estimated human population density, but exhibited an apparent 'step' in response at the suburban-peri-urban divide. Vigilance effort did not vary significantly between zones. This suggested that habituation did not occur with respect to surveillance for people, although surveillance presumably encompassed other predators too. Similar foraging effort and rates of food acquisition among zones could suggest that food abundance per individual was similar in urban and rural environments for Common Mynas, although this requires direct measurement."

A comparative experiment with live and robotic birds,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,22,1304,1311,10.1093/beheco/arr132,2011,"Predator detection is improved when individuals join groups. Theory assumes that the transfer of social information about predators among individuals is immediate and accurate. However, animals in groups space themselves at different distances. Little is known about the shape of the social information transfer function over distance, which can affect group cohesion and ultimately the costs and benefits of group living. Our goal was to study the flow of social information in 3 bird species with different visual acuity (European starling, brown-headed cowbird, and house finch). We used robotic birds to manipulate the availability of social information. In a previous study, we demonstrated that birds react to robotic birds in the same way as they do to live birds. We measured the probability of 3 linearly placed live birds reacting to the flushing behavior of 2 robotic birds of the same species. Our study species were tested independently. We found a nonlinear decrease in social information flow with increasing distance between the robots and live birds; however, this decrease was more pronounced in species with lower visual acuity. Additionally, social information apparently degraded when flowing between closely spaced individuals, which could lead to false alarms. Our findings suggest that the benefits of social information flow are restricted to small neighbor distances and that larger species, with higher visual acuity, may have a greater spatial domain of collective detection. This mechanism may explain the spatial limits of flocks based on the transfer of social information."

Results indicated that leaders were older, more criminally experienced, reported higher levels of contextual risk, yet reported lower feelings of social isolation than followers. For followers, early exposure to facility peer drug sales was especially impactful on their subsequent institutional substance use, while facility peer antisocial behavior was related concurrently to all youth's institutional antisocial behavior at each week of incarceration.

Successful management depends very much on the ability of the clinician to identify and eliminate the preventable factors, and on the vigilance of the owner in implementing the appropriate environmental changes. Management procedures are dictated by the need to eliminate or reduce all controllable predisposing factors, to break the habit, and to minimise exposure to the stimuli that evoke the behaviour.

However, little is known regarding its importance for the organization of cross-taxa community structure. Furthermore, the possibility that eavesdropping could allow species to coexist with a predator and access risky foraging habitat, thereby expanding their realized niche, has been little considered. Kalahari tree skinks (Trachylepis spilogaster) associate with sociable weaver (Philetairus socius) colonies as do African pygmy falcons (Polihierax semitorquatus), a predator of skinks and weavers. We undertook observational and experimental tests to determine if skinks eavesdrop on sociable weavers to mitigate any increase in predation threat that associating with weaver colonies may bring. Observations reveal that skinks use information from weavers to determine when predators are nearby; skinks were more active, more likely to forage in riskier habitats, and initiated flight from predators earlier in the presence of weavers compared with when weavers were absent. Playback of weaver alarm calls caused skinks to increase vigilance and flee, confirming that skinks eavesdrop on weavers. Furthermore, skinks at sociable weaver colonies were more likely to flee than skinks at noncolony trees, suggesting that learning is mechanistically important for eavesdropping behavior. Overall, it appears that eavesdropping allows skinks at colony trees to gain an early warning signal of potential predators, expand their realized niche, and join communities, whose predators may otherwise exclude them."

We tested the effect of such factors on recruitment processes in a group of 19 ewe lambs, Ovis aries, at pasture. Two observers continuously videotaped the behaviours of animals from a platform located in the centre of the field. Results showed that group orientation, group vigilance and activities such as head movements, stillness and number of steps increased before departure. Using general linear modelling we found that changes in most of these variables predicted the number of participants in movements. Similarly, activity of the first mover was modified in the last 2 min preceding departure, and at departure time the location and number of close neighbours of the first mover were especially influential in recruiting conspecifics. Animals first recruited were those that were close to the first mover and also its preferential partners. The behaviours of the second and third moving individuals could further influence the recruitment process. Moreover, there were clues that individuals were able to recruit others intentionally. Our findings emphasize that decision making in a group of domestic sheep was a continuous and distributed process. Recruitment depended both on group state and on the behaviour of individuals and their social relationships. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

High severity levels indicate a negative effect on human health, a disruption in economic activities, and possible disastrous consequences on the environmental ecosystem. This study investigated the power-law behaviors of air pollution events with high severity levels. Three types of power-law models were used to analyze the API data in Klang, Malaysia. The results revealed that the continuous power-law distribution is a reliable model for describing the power-law behaviors that occur in the upper tail of the API distribution. Air pollution events with severity levels greater than a threshold of 1221 were found to exhibit power-law behaviors. On this basis, this study suggest that authorities exercise vigilance with respect to pollution incidents with severity levels exceeding the 1221 threshold."

For women, wearing red clothing can be perceived by men as a signal of sexual receptivity. Thus, men may guard their mate more strongly when she is wearing red, relative to other colors. We tested this hypothesis by examining the intensity of anticipated mate-guarding behaviors in conditions where women were imagined (by their partner and themselves) to wear red or black clothing in a repeated-measures design. Results showed stronger anticipated mate-guarding behaviors from men when they imagined their partner in red, relative to black. Women were unable to predict the intensity of mate-guarding from their partner with respect to color condition. Partner satisfaction did not moderate these findings in either sex.

The generic structure of research article introductions and abstracts, which form a genre set, from two related fields, Conservation Biology and Wildlife Behavior, was compared. Findings indicate that research article introductions and abstracts in Conservation Biology bear a greater similarity in function and organization than the same two genres in Wildlife Behavior.

They were administered a Self-Regulation Scale (Schwarzer et al., 1999) and Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire (MDMQ) (Mann et al., 1997), adapted for the assessment of current decision making behavior. The results showed that self-regulation correlated positively with vigilant decision making and negatively with maladaptive decision making, such as buck-passing, hypervigilance, and procrastination. Moderation analysis revealed that situations with possible negative consequences weaken the relationship between self-regulation and both vigilance as well as maladaptive decision making."

These findings were replicated and extended in a second experiment. In this experiment, emotion words presented outside of conscious awareness were responded faster by arm flexion when they were associated with approach than when they were associated with avoidance, irrespective of their valence. Conversely, emotion words associated with avoidance were responded faster by arm extension. Globally, these findings suggest that the implicit perception of affective stimuli automatically triggers the behavioral responses that are associated with them. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Overall, 42% of birds foraged singly, primarily carnivores (raptors), nectarivores (hummingbirds) and lek-mating frugivores (manakins, some cotingas). Foraging in pairs (26.6%) was widespread, notably among insectivores in the 17-32-g size class. The remaining 31.4% of records were birds in groups of different composition and function, including, in order of decreasing frequency (1) multispecies upper canopy flocks (83 member species identified)-the largest and most mobile associations of small insectivores, nectarivores and frugivores, mostly tanagers; (2) understorey mixed species flocks of small insectivores, at midlevels of closed forest interior, with 12 core, obligate members and 74 occasional species, mostly active foliage or bark gleaners and probers sharing a unique set of ecological characteristics; (3) monospecific groups (29 species), either gregarious foragers but solitary breeders (large frugivores in canopy) or also breeding colonially or several permanently group living cooperative breeders; (4) opportunistic gatherings of frugivores at fruiting trees (at least 40 species); (5) army ant followers near ground of closed understorey (29 species of mid- to large-sized insectivores); (6) followers of Red-throated Caracaras Daptrius americanus (23 species, usually canopy frugivores entering understorey with caracaras); (7) two raptors following monkeys. Attributes of vulnerability to predators defined by habitat structure (vegetation density or openness) and foraging behaviour (conspicuousness, speed, degree of vigilance) were important determinants of nocking propensity, at least in flocks that were not attracted by a particular food source. The results suggest that the permanent mixed-species necks in the mature forest understorey may be an antipredator defence to compensate for the conspicuousness and reduced vigilance resulting from active foraging behaviour in semi-open vegetation, where early detection of predators is difficult."
"Seamans, Thomas W.; Blackwell, Bradley F.; Linnell, Kimberly E.",Use of predator hair to enhance perceived risk to white-tailed deer in a foraging context,HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS,10,300,311,,2016,"Deer react to predator scent in varying degrees even when exposed to unknown predators. This response could be genetically based and maintained as long as the population is exposed to predation. We tested whether predator scent in the form of hair would enhance perceived risk and serve as a foraging repellent to free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). During the winters of 2013 and 2014, we quantified alert behaviors and consumption of whole-kernel corn in response to current (coyote [Canis latrans]) and extirpated (bobcat [Lynx rufus]; black bear [Ursus americanus]) predator species alone and in combination with a partial visual barrier. Due to changes in herd dynamics and weather conditions, we did not compare results between years. We found enhanced alert behavior in all experiments except the 2014 exposure to coyote hair. Alert behaviors were heightened for about 4 days after hair placement. However, corn consumption was reduced only in the 2013 coyote-hair experiment. Our results suggest predator hair, when used alone and in conjunction with a form of visual barrier, can provide an element of protection from deer damage, but energetic needs will override the enhanced perceived risk caused by predator hair. Further work integrating complete visual barriers with predator hair is warranted."

Estimates suggest that 130 million women and girls have experienced FGC worldwide. A frequently cited reason for performing this procedure is to restrict female sexuality. To test this idea, we examined women's willingness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations (sociosexuality) among the traditional Igbo community in Southeastern Nigeria, a region in which FGC is prevalent. Women with FGC reported more restricted sociosexuality in all three domains (attitude, behavior, and desire) compared to women without FGC. Our results suggest that FGC significantly restricts female extra-pair behavior. We provide evidence that this practice is partially attributable to sexual conflict over reproduction by decreasing paternity uncertainty and increasing the reproductive costs to women."

Red-legged partridges used WT throughout the study period, but significant use did not occur until August. decreasing dramatically in mid September, and ending in October. A circadian watering pattern was observed during daylight hours with most photographs taken from 08:00 hours to 11:00 hours (54.8%). Partridges displayed different behaviours (drinking, feeding/dusting, vigilance, moving/unknown), but patterns did not vary significantly throughout the day. WT were used mostly by adult birds with only 26.5% of photographs also depicting young partridges. WT selection was strongly influenced by the presence of surrounding vegetation as partridges preferred troughs with shrub cover. We also found a significant negative relationship (P < 0.05) between the percentage of vigilant birds and covey size at water sources with shrub cover. Given the high predation rates observed in this species, security risk is likely an important factor involved in water-site selection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We videotaped sparrowhawks attacking redshank flocks to determine if there were differences in the timing of escape flights between flock members and the factors that might affect any differences. Sparrowhawks are surprise short-chase predators, so variation in the time taken to take flight on attack is likely to be a good index of predation risk. Most birds in a flock flew within 0.25 s of the first bird flying, and all birds were flying within 0.7 s. Redshanks that were vigilant, that were closest to the approaching raptor, and that were close to their neighbors took flight earliest within a flock. Birds in larger flocks took longer, on average, to take flight, measured from the time that the first bird in the flock flew Most birds took flight immediately after near neighbors took off, but later flying birds were more likely to fly immediately after more distant neighbors took flight. This result, along with the result that increased nearest neighbor distance increased flight delay, suggests that most redshanks flew in response to conspecifics flying. The results strongly suggest that there is significant individual variation in predation risk within flocks so that individuals within a flock will vary in benefits that they gain from flocking."

Additionally, the metaphor of theater used by the investigators for understanding improvisation is compared and contrasted with the metaphor of jazz improvisation. Jazz improvisation as a metaphor works well with the quantitative data coming from infant/caregiver video studies. These studies represent a more micro focus on embodied registrations of the emotional/behavioral interactive process and account for data which might be otherwise unconsciously overlooked or dissociated with a strategy valorizing I'mprovisation. I then visit the question of whether improvisation should be held as an ideal versus an ideal of continuous practice and vigilance for how theoretical biases, personal credos and habits of activity can become unreflective traps blocking spontaneous emergent possibilities for clinically relevant movement and growth."

This paper shows that the lexical semantics of emotive intensifiers in German, English and Chinese can be best explained in a cognitive-affective model of negativity bias. The parallel between a higher sensitivity to potentially threatening events at the neural level and the predominance of emotive intensifiers based on threat-relevant negative emotions at the linguistic level provides further evidence of the embodiment of linguistic conceptualisation. Ultimately, because the negativity bias is a vital component of our adaptive behaviour, the corresponding linguistic behaviour must be viewed as Part of our dynamic system of adaptation."

These data were compared to mating frequencies in sentinel females placed in the field during the first three weeks of May. Under colony conditions weak illumination in the final hour of the scotophase resulted in [approximately]90% mating on the first day after eclosion; significantly greater mating compared to complete darkness throughout the scotophase, weak illumination throughout the scotophase, or weak illumination for both the first and last hour of the scotophase. In an environmental chamber programmed to simulate spring conditions, little mating occurred on the first night after eclosion and three nights were required for more than 50% of the females to mate. There was no difference in mating frequency with between moths exposed to complete darkness throughout the scotophase and those provided with weak illumination in the last half hour of the scotophase or throughout the scotophase. This delay in age of first mating was consistent with field observations with sentinel females at May in the central San Joaquin Valley. The authors conclude that, along with greater longevity and later oviposition, first mating occurs at a later age in spring conditions compared to summer conditions in this species. Planned studies of the effect of delayed mating in first and second flights will need to take these factors into account."

In systems with high predation risk, prey display adjustments that can challenge resource acquisition. In such cases, prey may be limited in their ability to adjust their behaviour further in response to additional risk, such as that posed by human hunters (hunting risk). We investigated whether large African herbivores adjust their behaviour in response to hunting risk. In Hwange National Park (HNP), Zimbabwe, and in the peripheral hunting areas (HA), we monitored behaviour of impala, Aepyceros melampus, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, and sable antelope, Hippotragus niger, at waterholes. Once groups entered waterhole areas, their probability of returning to vegetation cover without drinking was higher in HA than in HNP. Individuals were more vigilant in HA than in HNP when they were approaching and leaving waterholes, but not during drinking. This suggests that drinking was prioritized over vigilance once individuals reached waterholes. The time that groups spent in waterhole areas did not differ significantly between HA and HNP, but individuals in HA were more vigilant, suggesting that groups limited their exposure to hunters. Greater kudus were the most vigilant, probably because they are the most vulnerable to predators. Sable antelopes were the least prone to compromise the acquisition of surface water. Both species consequently displayed adjustments of lower magnitude than impala in response to hunting risk. Our multispecies study illustrates how vulnerability to natural predators and environmental constraints limit behavioural responses of large herbivores to hunting risk.

Apart from greater distances from their neighbours, goslings did not benefit from being in larger sized families.

In laboratory trials, 20 individual ship rats (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (R. norvegicus) and house mice (Mus musculus) were presented with one of six bait types and a non-toxic food in a free-choice test for 10 days. All three species preferred Pestoff[registered trademark] 20R rodent bait. Most of the baits tested were long-life baits, and of these, Contrac[registered trademark] All Weather Blox and Pestoff[registered trademark] Rodent Blocks were the most preferred and effective. These two bait types were then used to test the amount eaten and effectiveness of weathered bait. Ten individuals of each species were presented over 3 or 10 days with a choice of non-toxic food and a bait type weathered for 1, 3, 5, 8 or 12 months. The amount of bait eaten by mice and ship rats remained high, despite weathering. In another trial, mice were presented with one of 32 bait type/weathering combinations and a choice of non-toxic food for 10 days. Toxin was the only significant factor influencing bait preference: all brodifacoum baits were eaten, resulting in a 100% death rate, but 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) baits were avoided, resulting in a death rate of only 8%. Either Contrac[registered trademark] All Weather Blox or Pestoff[registered trademark] Rodent Blocks would be suitable for use in 'island sentinel' bait stations against ship rats and mice. For Norway rats, frequent replacement of bait or development of a long-life formulation that they would find more attractive is recommended."
"Rountree, Rodney A.; Sedberry, George R.",A theoretical model of shoaling behavior based on a consideration of patterns of overlap among the visual fields of individual members,ACTA ETHOLOGICA,12,61,70,10.1007/s10211-009-0057-6,2009,"We propose a hypothetical visual field overlap (VFO) model for shoaling behavior. While solitary individuals have the disadvantage of a substantial blind zone to their rear, the overlapping visual fields among shoal members allows the shoal to collectively view nearly 360A degrees. A highly polarized shoal (i.e., a school) would be less advantageous than randomly oriented shoals because a substantial area blind to all school members (common blind zone) would occur at some distance behind the school. However, in situations where fishes must orient in one direction, the visual fields of individuals in the school overlap such that the common blind zone is considerably farther behind than the blind zone of any particular fish. A simple geometric relationship between school width, the blind angle, and the distance to the common blind zone predicts that larger schools can detect predators at a greater distance than smaller schools. Additionally, the model provides a novel explanation for the nearly universally observed tendency for fish to school together with like-sized individuals. Finally, the effect of school shape on the visual field overlap pattern would have a strong impact on predator-prey interactions. However, our model does not directly take into account the range of visibility or social interaction affects and applies only to small groups. The VFO model suggests that schooling may have arisen as an adaptation to enhance feeding efficiency by reducing the need for individual vigilant behavior while oriented into the current for feeding. We believe the VFO model promises to provide insight into the behavioral ecology of shoaling fishes and that it is highly amenable to both field and laboratory testing."
"Seki, Shin-Ichi; Sato, Tamotsu",The effect of a typhoon on the flocking and foraging behavior of tits,Ornithological Science,1,53,61,10.2326/osj.1.53,2002,"A typhoon, that struck Kyushu, the southernmost of the four main islands of Japan, in September 1999, causing extensive wind damage to forests, was found to have affected the flocking and foraging behavior of Varied Parus varius and Great Tits P. major. After the typhoon had passed, the tits tended to participate in mixed-species flocks and preferred to forage in the lower parts, rather than in the upper parts, of the trees. Also the proportion of plant products in the diet of the Varied Tit was reduced. The population and average flock size of the tits, however, remained stable even after the typhoon. The abundance of plant products as food resources remained unchanged despite severe damage to the trees, but the vegetation cover was reduced, which probably increased the predation risk. The increase of mixed-species flocking may have resulted from the increased risk of predation; mixed-species flocking is thought to increase vigilance and foraging efficiency while not increasing intraspecific competition. Changes in diet and preferred foraging sites were also consistent with the increased predation risk hypothesis. We conclude that the changes in foraging and flocking behavior after the typhoon were mainly due to the increased predation risk caused by the reduced vegetation cover."

Although local measurements can be used to estimate surface energy balance components, these values cannot be extrapolated to large areas due to the heterogeneity and complexity of agriculture environment. This extrapolation can be done using satellite images that provide information in visible and thermal infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum; however, most current satellite sensors do not provide this end, but they do include a set of spectral bands that allow the radiometric behavior of vegetation that is highly correlated with the ET. In this context, our working hypothesis states that it is possible to generate a strategy of integration and harmonization of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) sensors in order to obtain an NDVI time series used to estimate ET through fit equations specific to each crop type during an agricultural season (December 2017-March 2018). Based on the obtained results it was concluded that it is possible to estimate ET using an NDVI time series by integrating data from both sensors L8 and S2, which allowed to carry out an updated seasonal water balance over study site, improving the irrigation water management both at plot and water distribution system scale."

New-generation SAR sensors, namely ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1, can capture surface deformation with a high coherence in wide-swath mode, thereby providing outstanding across-track displacement accuracies; however, this improvement partially sacrifices the azimuth resolution, which affects the retrieval of 3D surface deformation fields. To explore the feasibility of generating 3D deformation maps with new SAR imagery, we collect two pairs of ALOS-2 ScanSAR and four pairs of Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) images for the 12 November 2017 Ezgeleh earthquake. Furthermore, the differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR), pixel offset tracking (POT), multiple-aperture InSAR (MAI), and burst-overlap interferometry (BOI) methods are used to measure the across- and along-track displacements. Compared with the POT and MAI methods, the integration of DInSAR and BOI measurements provides high-quality 3D deformation maps with an accuracy of 4cm, which is four times and two times better than the accuracies of the POT and MAI methods integrated with DInSAR, respectively. In addition, a significant north-south displacement of 0.76m is found in our 3D deformation results that was underestimated in the slip distribution model constrained with seismic waveforms or InSAR measurements. Our 3D deformation map of the 2017 Ezgeleh earthquake indicates a southwestward horizontal motion and an upward motion without any corresponding surface rupture that effectively match the behavior of a blind rupture along a northeast-dipping reverse fault. We conclude that combining BOI with DInSAR would provide a better 3D deformation field and should be applied to study future earthquakes."

Female P. citrella located and oviposited on 75% of sentinel citrus plants placed 1.2 km west of the groves by 6 weeks. Movement of this species as far as 1.2 km suggests that groves treated with pheromone components for mating disruption will be vulnerable to damage caused by mated females arriving from neighboring groves within 1.2 km. Treated groves may be particularly susceptible to influx of moths carried on wind."

To test whether generalist egg parasitoids of European Pentatomidae have the potential to control H. halys, and whether these could be as effective as their related Asian species, sentinel egg masses of H. halys and six native European pentatomids were exposed in two regions of Switzerland. Freeze-killed sentinel egg masses of H. halys were attacked by the platygastrid Trissolcus cultratus and the eupelmid Anastatus bifasciatus, whereas fresh egg masses of native Pentatomidae occassionally yielded four Scelionidae species: Trissolcus semistriatus, T. scutellaris, T. cultratus and Telenomus chloropus. In no-choice tests, T. chloropus and T. semistratus produced no offspring from fresh H. halys eggs, whereas T. cultratus and T. scutellaris were sporadically able to complete development. Stopping embryogenesis by freezing egg masses of H. halys at -80 A degrees C enabled T. cultratus and T. semistriatus to produce a high number of offspring without influencing the behaviour of the parasitoids. In contrast to European platygastrids, the Asian parasitoids Trissolcus japonicus and T. cultratus (Chinese strain) caused significantly higher parasitism of fresh H. halys eggs. Differences in developmental success may be related to less efficient venom of European scelionids injected during oviposition. To date, A. bifasciatus is the only potential candidate for augmentaive biological control of H. halys in Europe as it was the only European parasitoid capable of consistent, successful development on fresh H. halys eggs."

Red-collared Widowbirds differ from most other Euplectes species, in that male nest-building is reduced to simple nest-rings used in courtship; females alone position and build nests in the territories. Females used only 37% of available territory area for nesting and aggregated at the centers of territories, possibly to take advantage of male vigilance from prominent central perches or to avoid harassment by neighbors. However, irrespective of territory size or number of females on the territory, females maintained relatively even spacing, with nests similar to15 m apart. Nest predation rates were higher (28.2% day(-1)) during the nestling period than during incubation (14.6%), but independent of the number of actively nesting females on a territory. During synchronous nestling stages, however, birds nesting close to other birds incurred higher predation costs. Females may; therefore, centrally clump their nests on a territory but maintain enough distance between nests to reduce nest predation. Females choosing unmated males (monogamous) received no greater costs or benefits than females settling with mated males (polygynous). Taken with our earlier finding of strong female preference for longer-tailed males (Pryke et al. 2001a), our results here suggest that females may gain indirect genetic benefits of higher-quality offspring without incurring the high costs of sharing territories.

The aims of this study were to determine whether lactating bighorn ewes have higher foraging time, bite rate or selectivity of forage than barren ewes and whether reproductive status affects migration patterns. Ewes with male lambs were predicted to spend more time foraging and to have a higher bite rate than ewes with female lambs. There were no differences in foraging behavior according to ewe reproductive status from April to August. In September-November lactating ewes had a higher bite rate and spent more time foraging than nonlactating ewes but lamb gender did not affect foraging behavior. Lactating ewes gained less weight than nonlactating ones until mid-August; from mid-August to late September mass gain was similar for both groups of ewes. Nonlactating ewes spent more time standing but reproductive status did not affect vigilance behavior or step rate while foraging. Ewes with lambs did not differ from nonlactating ewes in step rate. Pregnant ewes migrated earlier than barren ewes to alpine areas in spring. By so doing they abandoned areas with good quality forage presumably to give birth in areas safer from predation. All ewes spent most of the summer in the alpine range but nonlactating ewes returned to the winter range earlier than lactating ewes, probably to profit from the abundant forage there."

Since duet coordination presumably requires high attentiveness between signallers, the coalition quality hypothesis suggests it may indicate the ability or motivation of partners to engage cooperatively in aggressive interactions against intruders. To test this hypothesis, we monitored behavioural as well as vocal responses in a playback experiment conducted with a polyphonal duetting bird, the rufous hornero, Furnarius rufus. We used three categories of treatments in the experiment, which totalled six treatments: duet playbacks that varied in phrase overlap and coordination of temporal rhythms; nonoverlapped (consecutive) solos; and a control heterospecific song. We predicted that birds would respond more strongly to playbacks of coordinated duets than to uncoordinated duets, and also to playbacks of uncoordinated duets than to nonoverlapping male and female solo songs. Coordinated duets (degree of phrase overlap) provoked the weakest response across conspecific stimuli, whereas the responses to uncoordinated duets and nonoverlapped solos were similar. However, partners produced more highly coordinated duets (degree of phrase overlap) in response to coordinated duets (association of phrase rhythms), when compared to all other stimuli. These results suggest that territorial pairs not only perceive but also alter their degree of temporal coordination of duets during territorial interactions. In addition, partners seem to behave cautiously and with more coordinated duets when responding to paired intruders that produce coordinated duets. Our results partially support the coalition quality hypothesis, suggesting that duet coordination may indicate the ability of partners to cooperatively engage in aggressive interactions.

For Homo sapiens, 'environmental sustainability' must therefore be, ultimately, about sustaining health-supporting environmental conditions.

The monkeys crossed the river at its more narrow points, with several individuals or groups crossing simultaneously. Increased vigilance prior to crossing and leaping as far across the river as possible were also observed. Proboscis monkey groups often associate at their sleeping sites at the river's edge. A potential function of these associations may be to allow groups to synchronize their movement with other groups during river crossings."

In carnivorans, competitive interactions are disproportionately costly to subordinate carnivores who must account for the risk of interspecific killing when foraging. Accordingly, missed opportunity costs for meso-carnivores imposed by risk can benefit the smallest-bodied competitors. However, the extent to which the risk perpetuates into spatial partitioning in hierarchically structured communities remains unknown. To determine how risk-avoidance behaviors shape the space-use of carnivore communities, we studied a simple community of carnivores in northern Patagonia, Argentina: pumas (Puma concolor; an apex carnivore), culpeo foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus; a meso-carnivore), and chilla foxes (Lycalopex griseus; a small carnivore). We used multi-species occupancy models to quantify the space use within the carnivore community and giving-up densities to understand the behaviors that structure space use. Notably, we applied an analytical framework that tests whether the actual or perceived risk of predation most strongly influences the space use of subordinate carnivores although accounting for their foraging and vigilance behaviors. We found that there was a dominance hierarchy from the apex carnivore through the meso-carnivore to the subordinate small carnivore, which was reflected in space. Although both meso- and small carnivores exhibited similar predator avoidance behavioral responses to apex carnivores, the habitat associations of apex carnivores only altered meso-carnivore space use. The biases in risk management we observed for meso-carnivores likely translates into stable co-existence of this community of competing carnivores. We believe our analytical framework can be extended to other communities to quantify the spatial-behavioral tradeoffs of risk."

We investigated which species alarm-call, and the characteristics of their calls, in a large flock system of a Sri Lankan rainforest. We recorded naturally elicited alarm calls during several attacks by Accipiter hawks and while following flocks for 10 h. We then artificially elicited alarms by throwing a stick to the side of the flock, in a total of 70 trials at 30 flock sites. The Orange-billed Babbler (Turdoides rufescens) was the most frequent caller to both the artificial and natural stimuli, followed by the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo (Dicrurus paradiseus). Several other species also called, and multiple species often called to the same stimulus (in 23 trials, and in all of the hawk attacks). The species differed in their rapidity of response and in their sensitivity to different natural stimuli. Calls of the gregarious babbler usually provided a first, unreliable warning of an incoming threat, whereas later calls of other species emphasized the seriousness of the threat. We suggest that birds in mixed-species flocks may be particularly aware of aerial predators for two reasons: (1) a numbers effect, whereby nongregarious species are more aware of predators when surrounded by large numbers of other species; and (2) an information effect, whereby species differ in the information available in their alarm calls, leading to an accumulation of information in a mixed-species flock."

Although these vocalizations may be a source of information for heterospecifics, it remains largely unknown how heterospecifics respond to mobbing calls given by group-living species. In this study, we investigate whether the mobbing calls given by Western Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen dorsalis) lead to the recruitment of heterospecifics. By presenting a taxidermied red fox (Vulpes vulpes)-representing a terrestrial predator threat-to a population of magpies and heterospecific species occupying the same area, we demonstrate that magpie calls given in response to a terrestrial predator recruit heterospecifics to the mobbing event. Heterospecifics are more likely to approach and engage in mobbing behavior when the predator is associated with magpie presence than when magpies are absent. We found that larger magpie groups produced more alarm calls than did smaller groups, but we found no evidence that group size affected heterospecific recruitment to the mobbing site. Therefore, the occurrence of magpie alarm calls, rather than the number of individuals giving alarm calls, seems to be the primary predictor of heterospecific recruitment to a mobbing site. Moreover, we used a playback experiment to test if heterospecifics responded more to single-magpie mobbing alarm calls than to single mobbing alarm calls given by a non-social species (red wattlebird, Anthochaera carunculata). We found that heterospecifics responded more to the playbacks of magpie than to red wattlebird alarm calls. Our study therefore suggests that Australian magpies may play a central role as information sources for heterospecific species during predator detection and mobbing events. Significance statement Mobbing-when individuals move toward and vocalize or harass a predator-is a good example of interspecific communication. Loud vocalizations produced during mobbing behavior have been known to not only modify the behavior of the predator but to also recruit individuals to the mobbing event from a variety of different species. Although the response to heterospecific mobbing calls is becoming well documented, it remains largely unknown how heterospecifics respond to the mobbing calls of group-living species, even though these species can provide significant benefits for heterospecific species sharing the same habitat (via increased vigilance and predator detection rates for example). By presenting a predator model and using a series of playback experiments, we demonstrate that group-living Western Australian magpies may play a central role as information sources during predator detection and mobbing events."

Although Accipiters are the major predators of small wintering birds, we know little about their behavior during the winter. In this paper, we present the first description of the predatory behavior of wintering sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus), focusing on their selection of prey and attack strategies. We also relate basic prey behavior to the risk of death during an attack. During the winters of 2000-2004, we observed 255 attacks and recovered 112 prey items from 21 intensively radio-tracked hawks. The diet of sharp-shinned hawks in the study was composed primarily of sparrow-sized prey, intermediate-sized starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), American robins (Turdus migratorius), and the occasional larger prey such as mourning doves (Zenaida macroura). Both sexes killed all sizes of prey, although female hawks took significantly more large prey than did males. Small preys under 20 g, such as parids, were largely ignored. This lack of very small prey in the diet of sharp-shinned hawks suggests that we might focus the small-bird-in-winter paradigm on sparrows and intermediate-sized prey, such as robins, as the main prey base of Accipiters at least in North America. In addition, solitary and feeding prey were significantly more likely to be captured during an attack than prey in groups and those not feeding. Our hawk-driven observations provide rare empirical support for the concept that flocking birds are safer than solitary birds and alert birds experience less risk than those preoccupied with feeding."

Isolation often leads to the loss of costly antipredator behavior, which may have adverse consequences if the population should later come into contact with predators. An understanding of both the mechanism (i.e. the degree to which antipredator behavior depends on experience), and of the time course of loss is important to be able to predict how a population will respond to future contact. We studied 'group-size effects'- the way in which animals change the time they allocate to antipredator vigilance as a function of group size - and visual and acoustic predator recognition in a population of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii), a cat-sized (6-10 kg) macropodid marsupial. To study group size effects we observed wallabies foraging in four populations - three with some sort of predator and a New Zealand population that was isolated from all predators for about 130 yr. To study predator recognition, we observed the response of New Zealand wallabies to the presentation of a model or taxidermic mount of mammalian predators, and to the broadcast sounds of mammalian and avian predators. We compare these predator recognition experiments with results from a previous study of Kangaroo Island (South Australia) tammars. Complete isolation from all predators for as few as 130 yr led to the loss of group size effects and a rapid breakdown in visual predator recognition abilities. Our results are consistent with a key prediction of the multi-predator hypothesis - namely, that the isolation from all predators may lead to a rapid loss of antipredator behavior."

Our previous finding of reduced vigilance among jackdaws and lesser kestrels residing in mixed-species colonies suggested a reliance on interspecific communication of information regarding predatory threats. To test for interspecific communication of threat, we first determined whether jackdaw and lesser kestrel call structure varied with perceived threat. In this call production phase of our study, free-living birds in mixed-species colonies were presented with models representing a potential nest predator (European magpie) or with non-threatening stimuli (wood pigeon or wooden dowel) in proximity to nests. We recorded and subsequently analysed those calls to determine if any temporal or frequency-related call parameters differed by model type. In a second, perceptual phase of our study, we tested whether receivers perceive threat-related variation in both conspecific and heterospecific call structure by playing back call exemplars recorded in response to the predator model or to innocuous control stimuli, to determine whether free-living jackdaws or lesser kestrels respond differentially to playbacks of the different call types. We detected differences in vocalizations of both jackdaws and lesser kestrels relative to the model type presented, with more broadband (lesser kestrel) or noisy calls (jackdaws) in response to magpie versus innocuous model types. We also detected differential behavioural responses to call playbacks, with both jackdaws and lesser kestrels increasing vigilance and alarm calling in response to magpie-elicited jackdaw calls, but not to other call types. Taken together, our results suggest that jackdaw, but not lesser kestrel vocalizations, communicate enhanced threat associated with European magpies as possible nest predators. This interspecific alarm communication benefits both jackdaws and lesser kestrels, and, at least in part, explains asymmetric responses of jackdaws and lesser kestrels to magpies attending mixed-species colonies in nature."

We studied anti-predator responses of ungulates by means of camera traps to an olfactory cue (fresh scat) of an ambush predator, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) both important prey species for lynx were not more vigilant when exposed to lynx scent, but reduced their visitation duration. Our results contrast with previously reported responses of red deer to scent from a coursing predator, the wolf (Canis lupus), where only vigilance and foraging behaviour but not visitation duration changed in response to wolf scat. This indicates that ungulates are able to recognize the risk of predation from predators with differing hunting modes based on olfactory cues and adjust their anti-predatory behaviour."

Cave-adapted species, isolated from epigean (i.e., surface) selection pressures, have been discovered with aphotic adaptations like blindness, depigmentation, and enhanced extra-optic sensory systems. This evolutionary process, however, only occurs in a fraction of cave ecosystems. Many cave species, especially those in tropical latitudes, occur with epigean conspecifics with ongoing gene flow and epigean migration. This includes populations of the amblypygid Phrynus longipes (Pocock 1894), which occur in both epigean and cave environments. I hypothesized that cave and epigean populations exhibit behavioral variation to meet the selection pressures of their respective environments. I conducted open-arena and interaction behavioral assays to test for behavioral variation between populations. Assays revealed that cave and epigean amblypygids exhibited environment-specific behavioral variation. Cave animals were more vigilant and engaged in hunting behaviors, but were less active in general, relative to epigean conspecifics. Comparative modeling indicated that aggressive behaviors during agonistic interactions were the best predictors of environment. Indeed, epigean interactions escalated to physical aggression sooner and included longer weaponry displays than did the interactions of cave conspecifics. Trial design allowed for measurements of territorial behavior, which showed that residency effects were more profound in epigean interactions than in those of cave conspecifics. The high density of amblypygids in the cave population may have resulted in more tolerant, less aggressive behaviors relative to epigean conspecifics. Thus, these findings fit the ecological and demographic conditions of each environment."

I investigated whether foraging site selection in winter (tree species, height, substrate size) differed between sexes and whether this difference was related to the presence of mixed-species flocks. Foraging sites of pair members foraging together were highly correlated. In the rare cases when each used different tree species, males foraged significantly more often on the preferred oak trees than females. Males foraged significantly lower than females in some territories, but not in others. The reasons for this significant Variation between pairs remains unexplained. Males also foraged lower than females in the company of mixed flocks. These differences are probably better explained as avoidance of the dominant male by the subordinate female, rather than specialization in resource use to avoid competition."

To counter this, birds have evolved different behavioural strategies to decrease the visibility of their nests, thus reducing the probability of nest detection. We manipulated the long-term perception of nest predation risk in pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) by experimentally increasing the nest vulnerability to predators. We placed treatment and control nest-boxes for breeding pied flycatchers that appeared identical during the initial phase of breeding. But after the removal of a front panel, treatment boxes had an enlarged entrance hole, almost twice the initial diameter. This treatment increases actual predation risk and presumably parental perception of risk. Control boxes presented instead an entrance hole of the same size both before and after the manipulation. When breeding in enlarged entrance holes, females doubled the vigilance at the nest while males reduced the time spent at the nest, compared to pied flycatchers breeding in control boxes. Increased vulnerability of the nest site to predation risk, thus, induced pied flycatcher parents to increase nest vigilance while reducing their activity at the nest. These results highlight the existence of plasticity in incubation behaviours under long-term experimentally increased nest predation risk."

The diurnal pattern of brood dispersion after swim-up consists of expansion during the day and contraction in the evening. We measured the areas occupied by both the broods and parental males after swim-up to determine if males adjust their parental surveillance to the dispersion of the blood. Male nest range, as determined from sonic tracking procedures, was found to be significantly related to the dispersion of the brood and not to the developmental stage (larval versus juvenile) of the offspring. This relationship indicates that parental vigilance after swim-up continues to be non-depreciable in the same manner as parental defense prior to swim-up."

Here we investigated whether North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, are able to minimize costs of territory defence by adjusting behaviour in response to the familiarity of neighbouring conspecifics. Since red squirrels living in familiar neighbourhoods face reduced intrusion risk, we predicted that increasing familiarity among territorial neighbours would allow squirrels to spend less time on territorial defence and more time in the nest. Longitudinal behavioural data (1995-2004) collected from the same squirrels across several different social environments indicated that red squirrels reduced rates of territorial vocalizations and increased nest use in response to increasing familiarity with neighbours. In contrast, cross-sectional data (2015-2016), which provided observations from each individual in a single social environment, did not provide evidence of this plasticity. Post hoc analyses revealed that evidence of social plasticity in this system is primarily due to within-individual changes in behaviour, which we were unable to estimate in the cross-sectional data. Our results demonstrate that red squirrels respond to changes in their social environment by adjusting their behaviour in a manner that reduces the costs of territoriality. However, our results also suggest that estimating plasticity by comparing behaviour among individuals (i.e. cross-sectional analyses) may not always be reliable. Our ability to detect these effects may therefore depend on having data with multiple observations from the same individuals across different social environments.

In dimorphic species, females are usually more selective in food choice, show greater bite rates and spend more time foraging than males. We evaluated sexual differences in foraging behaviour in Apennine chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata, during the warm season, before the rut. Both sexes selected nutritious vegetation patches and spent a comparable amount of time feeding. However, males had a significantly greater feeding intensity (bite rate) and a lower search effort for feeding (step rate), as well as they spent more time lying down than females. Females selected foraging sites closer to refuge areas than males. In chamois, sexual size dimorphism is seasonal, being negligible in winter-spring, but increasing to 30-40 % in autumn. Our results suggest that males enhance their energy and mass gain by increasing their food intake rate during the warm season, to face the costs of the mating season (November). Conversely, females seem to prioritize a fine-scale selection of vegetation and the protection of offspring. A great food intake rate of males in the warm season could have developed as a behavioural adaptation leading herbivores to the evolutionary transition from year-round monomorphism to permanent dimorphism, through seasonal dimorphism."
"Kirkman, M; Smith, A; Rosenthal, D",Safe sex is not contraception: Reclaiming 'safe sex' for HIV/STD prevention,VENEREOLOGY-THE INTERDISCIPLINARY INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEXUAL HEALTH,11,25,28,,1998,"This paper urges vigilance in retaining the meaning of 'safe sex' as ways of having sex that reduce or eliminate the chances of contracting an STD. Interviews with heterosexual adolescents revealed that the term 'safe sex' is frequently understood to mean contraception. There is also evidence of this shift in meaning in the wider community. The condom, because of its use for both contraception and the prevention of disease, and because of its role in safe sex campaigns, is identified as pivotal to this shift in meaning. When 'safe sex' means contraception, heterosexual adolescents are made more vulnerable to STDs. Sex is still 'safe' when condoms are discarded in favour of the oral contraceptive pill. It is argued that policy makers, educators, researchers, and medical practitioners need to take account of the way in which the term 'safe sex' may be (mis)understood in order to ensure that the meaning of 'safe sex' as the prevention of STDs is retained and emphasised."

Competition may also alter the foraging behaviour of individuals, which can be influenced by dominance status and the way food is distributed over the environment. Many studies measuring the effects of competition and dominance status have been conducted on a uniform or highly clumped food distribution, while in reality prey distributions are often in-between these two extremes. The few studies that used a more natural food distribution only detected subtle effects of interference and dominance. We therefore conducted an experiment on a natural food distribution with focal mallards Anas platyrhynchos foraging alone and in a group of three, having a dominant, intermediate or subordinate dominance status. In this way, the foraging behaviour of the same individual in different treatments could be compared, and the effect of dominance was tested independently of individual identity. The experiment was balanced using a 4 x 4 Latin square design, with four focal and six non-focal birds. Individuals in a group achieved a similar intake rate (i.e. number of consumed seeds divided by trial length) as when foraging alone, because of an increase in the proportion of time feeding (albeit not significant for subordinate birds). Patch residence time and the number of different patches visited did not differ when birds were foraging alone or in a group. Besides some agonistic interactions, no differences in foraging behaviour between dominant, intermediate and subordinate birds were measured in group trials. Possibly group-foraging birds increased their feeding time because there was less need for vigilance or because they increased foraging intensity to compensate for competition. This study underlines that a higher competitor density does not necessarily lead to a lower intake rate, irrespective of dominance status."

This produces negative emotions, vigilance motivation, and higher attention to both the disconfirming target and its background location. Within a typical person memory paradigm, participants had to form an impression about a target person who was either male or female and was described by gender-stereotype congruent, incongruent, and irrelevant attributes. Later, they were asked to recollect the information in a background-sensitive recognition test. Participants' regulatory focus strength and modern sexism were ase sed. As predicted, the higher the combination of both prevention focus and prejudice the better the memory for both the target and its background information for incongruent items. In addition, the higher this combination, the more intense were agitation-related emotions (i.e., worry and tension), and the stronger was the desire To meet the person. Implications for both the person memory and stereotype literatures are discussed."

In the present research it was examined whether warning people of the presence of subliminal ads could decrease subliminal advertising effects. In Study 1, it was demonstrated that warning people of subliminal ads indeed diminished priming effects on consumer choice, whereas subliminal advertising effects were replicated for people who were not warned (i.e., people for whom the primed brand was goal relevant were more likely to select it when primed). Study 2 extended these findings, revealing that both participants warned before and after the priming manipulation were less influenced by subliminal brand primes than controls. This suggests that the warning does not decrease participants' sensitivity to the prime, but instead affects the influence of the prime at the behavioral level.

Details of time?activity budgets can provide information on how animals allocate time to their various activities through the day and during different seasons to most efficiently cope with varying energy demands and environmental changes that may threaten their survival. Efficient use of time?activity budget is also crucial for alpine small mammals, which live in a highly seasonal environment with restricted periods in which to gain energy and successfully reproduce. Hence, variations in the time?activity budget of the high-elevation lagomorph Royle?s pika (Ochotona roylei) were analysed during different seasons over 2 years across an elevational gradient (2900?3680 m). Seven behavioural conditions were recorded in adult and juvenile pikas through daily focal sampling between 0600 and 1900 hrs. Royle?s pika had bimodal activity: animals were most active during the morning and early evening and relatively inactive during midday hours. Adult pikas allocated the largest proportion of their time?activity budget to foraging and the smallest proportion to vocalisation. Greater food availability during the monsoon season encouraged pikas to spend more of their time foraging than on other activities. In the autumn, pikas spent more time on locomotory and musing activities. Vigilance activities were most frequent during midday hours, possibly due to a high risk of predation. Locomotion and foraging were the predominant behaviours of juveniles during the summer and monsoon seasons. Prominent food hoarding activities were not observed in either adult or juvenile pikas. Information on time allocation to different activities during different seasons should provide a baseline for future behavioural ecology and bioenergetic analyses of pikas and help to understand their potential for adaptation to climate change."

We examined a wild population of western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) to test the efficacy of predator faecal odour in influencing time allocated to different behaviours and inducing changes in habitat use. Kangaroos were exposed to fresh faeces of a historical predator, the dingo (Canis lupus dingo), a recently introduced predator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), a herbivore (horse, Equus caballus) and an unscented control simultaneously. Kangaroos did not increase vigilance in predator-scented areas. However, they investigated odour sources by approaching and sniffing; more time was spent investigating fox odour than control odours. Kangaroos then exhibited a clear anti-predator response to predator odours, modifying their space use by rapidly escaping, then avoiding fox and dingo odour sources. Our results demonstrate that wild western grey kangaroos show behavioural responses to predator faeces, investigating then avoiding these olfactory cues of potential predation risk, rather than increasing general vigilance. This study contributes to our understanding of the impact of introduced mammalian predators on marsupial prey and demonstrates that a native Australian marsupial can recognize and respond to the odour of potential predators, including one that has been recently introduced."

Black lemurs emit sparse harmonic sounds, dense harmonic sounds, spectrally structured noise (Beeman, 1998) and a wide variety of grunts. The second study focused on the behavioral context of emission of these signals and used the pre- and post-event histogram method (Douglass and Sudd, 1980; Preuschoft, 1995a). It provides statistical demonstration of the association between a signal and other behaviors of the emitter, thus giving insight into the latter's motivations. Four signals are linked to affiliative and agonistic interactions. Three signals express a state of alarm, and two appear related to discomfort. Most grunts are linked to contact and signal precisely the emitter's level of vigilance. Other interdisciplinary communication studies could benefit from methodology and software used here."

It has been argued that each fundamental motive is activated by cues pertaining to threats or opportunities linked with each fundamental motive, and may be based on qualitatively different cognitive and neural systems. Steroid hormones influence specific neural systems and consumer behaviors rooted in diverse fundamental motives. By taking steroid sex hormones as examples of internal cues, we suggested that at least three fundamental motives (status attainment, mate attraction, and mate retention) may be explained by common cognitive and neural mechanisms. Consumer behaviors rooted in diverse fundamental motives, including status attainment, mate attraction, and mate retention, may be commonly explained by social motivations/vigilance (amygdala) and reward processing (reward-related brain regions). Neuroscientific tools may be useful for refining the fundamental motive framework, and for understanding more fully consumer behaviors rooted in evolutionary motives."

A survey for parasitoids of P. viburni was conducted in the Edna Valley appellation wine grape region from 2005 to 2007, 6-8 years after classical biological control releases were discontinued. Two survey methods were used. First, field collections of obscure mealybugs from commercial vineyard blocks (2005-2007) and, second, placement of sentinel mealybugs on potted (1 L) grape vines (2006 only). From both survey methods, P. flavidulus was recovered, albeit levels of parasitism were low (less than 0.6%). We also placed longtailed mealybug, Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni Tozzetti), on potted plants concurrent with placement of sentinel obscure mealybugs in the vineyard in order to measure parasitoid activity on this closely-related mealybug species. No P. flavidulus were recovered from P. longispinus. Other encyrtid parasitoids reared from either P. viburni or P. longispinus were Anagyrus pseudococci (Girault), Leptomastix dactylopii Howard, Leptomastidea abnormis (Girault), Coccidoxenoides perminutus Girault, and Tetracnemoidea peregrina (Compere). A hyperparasitoid, Chaetocerus sp., was also reared. The data are discussed with respect to biological control of vineyard mealybugs and newly developed controls for the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Because Pseudaphycus species reared from mealybugs are superficially very similar a taxonomic key and discussion of host relationships for selected Pseudaphycus species are provided."

Vocal communication signals are both long-range and short-range sounds. We describe seven call types: flight call (long-range), long-range alarm call, congregation call (long-range), two agonistic calls (long-range/short-range), sentinel call (shortrange), and a short-range alarm call. The flight call is equivalent to the functional song and contains the species-specific recognition code. Flight calls may also be uttered when perched and, when in quick series, function as long-range alarm calls. Long-range alarm calls become a high intensity congregation signal when several individuals overlap and, despite degradation and attenuation, may contain the species-specific code over distances of 800 m. The average (+/- SD) feeding flock size was 7.7 +/- 8.2 individuals (n = 116) while the roosting flock size was 79.1 +/- 10.5 individuals (n = 7). Short-range calls maintain communication while minimizing detection. High intensity vocalizations allow long-range communication, improving feeding efficiency through use of large areas and stimulating late afternoon roost congregations. Low intensity vocalizations maintain communications without providing the position of the parrot. Received 22 June 2010. Accepted 9 February 2011."

It was hypothesized that attitude has a positive influence on behavioral intentions, including intentions to use and willingness to pay more. Based on the theoretical relationships, a research model comprising 10 hypotheses are presented and validated by examining a total of 321 samples collected in Korea. Data analysis results indicated that four sub-dimensions of consumer innovativeness, namely, novelty seeking, quality experience seeking, hedonic experience seeking, and social distinctiveness, enhance attitude toward using drone food delivery services. Furthermore, the results showed that attitude plays an important role in the formation of intentions to use and willingness to pay more."

Space-borne altimeter observations have become an important data source to supplement in-situ measurements of water levels. The applications of satellite radar altimetry in monitoring reservoirs at global or regional scales have been well demonstrated in many previous studies. However, studies on medium- and small-sized reservoirs are limited due to the coarser footprints and relatively low vertical accuracy. In anticipation of new satellite laser altimetry missions, we aim to demonstrate the coverage performance of ICESat-2 for global reservoirs and to further explore its application potential in monitoring the long-term changes in water level and storage of reservoirs by integrating Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery datasets. In the first 18 months of the ICESat-2 mission, we find that ICESat-2 observations can cover 6231 out of 7250 reservoirs worldwide inventoried in the GRanD database with a size ranging from 0.1 km(2) to 67166.2 km(2), which accounts for nearly 86% in count and about 99% in area and capacity for the whole of GRanD-inventoried reservoir. We then select 40 reservoirs of different sizes and shapes located in different continents to establish the hypsometric curves. Most of these reservoirs show robust fitting in the hypsometric curves, with the R-2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.99 and the RMSE values from 0.37 m to 1.01 m. As a new global satellite altimetry dataset, ICESat-2 shows excellent potential in reconstructing long-term water levels with the hypsometric curve method for various reservoirs. We also find that the ICESat-2 ATL13 product misses a small proportion of reservoirs for various reasons, including their small size, latitudinal narrow shape, and data inconsistency between the HydroLAKES as water mask of the ICESat-2 ATL13 product and the updated GRanD data sets. With the continued observation of ICESat-2 and possibly updated inland water body mask for the ATL13 product in the future, many reservoirs can be routinely monitored with high accuracy. Our findings confirm the powerful capacity of ICESat-2 and are expected to enhance our understanding of reservoir behavior in global hydrological processes and water resource management."

We add to this view by arguing that some individuals create their own contexts, and do so in a way that follows them across dyads, groups, and organizations. We call these individual-specific contexts personal ecosystems, and propose that they are created when an actor consistently engages in visible behaviors that trigger similar and visible reactions across targets of that behavior. We attribute the formation of personal ecosystems to social inertia, and identify three individual traits that increase the likelihood that an individual's behavior is consistent across people and situations: low self-monitoring, implicit beliefs, and low levels of emotional intelligence. Finally, we discuss why understanding personal ecosystems is important for organizations, identify managerial implications of this phenomenon, and strategies for diminishing the likelihood of having personal ecosystems."

Here, we test two approaches to correct atmospheric errors-phase elevation correlations and global weather models and assess the ability of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series to detect deformation anomalies using either a fixed threshold or a cumulative sum control chart. We use the 2017-2018 crisis at Agung volcano as a case example because strong atmospheric signals were originally misidentified as true deformation, and obscured the subtle deformation pattern associated with magmatic activity. We assess the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) of each method and found the average area under the ROC curve to be about 0.5 for the uncorrected data (corresponding to no discrimination capability), around 0.8 after combined atmospheric corrections (weather model and phase elevation approaches), and more than 0.95 using a cumulative sum control chart (where 1 corresponds to ideal separation between classes). Our results retrospectively show that uplift could have been detected to a 95% level of confidence for both ascending and descending time series by October 2017, 15 days after the start of the seismic swarm and 1 month prior to the eruption. Thus, our approach successfully flags anomalous behavior without relying on visual inspection or selection of an arbitrary threshold, and hence shows potential as a monitoring tool for volcano observatories globally."

A new time-saving colony examination method, including the use of an internal divider reduced the time needed for hive inspections by 31.86 % on average. Prioritizating the inspection of pollen and honey combs rather than brood combs is advised.

Using the mate retention inventory and the partner-directed insults scale, we conducted two studies to test this hypothesis. Study I included 245 men who reported their mate retention behaviors and partner-directed insults. Correlations and multiple regression analyses documented the predicted relationships between men's partner-directed insults and mate retention behaviors.

However, any increases in reserves may increase the risk of predation because extra mass probably compromises escape ability. Because of differences in foraging ability not all individuals will be affected in the same way by changes in foraging conditions. Relatively poor foragers will have more unpredictable foraging success for any given availability of food and therefore should carry larger body reserves. The mass-dependent predation hypothesis then predicts a negative correlation between levels of body reserves and foraging ability, although this may be modified by state-dependent compensation. I measured foraging rates and body masses of wintering European blackbirds, Turdus merula. Individuals with the lowest foraging rates had the largest gain in mass for the winter and had relatively high mass overall, independently of age and sex. That foraging rate determined mass rather than the reverse was demonstrated because foraging rate was independent of daily and seasonal mass change. Foraging rate within the experimental system was also independent of predation risk (as measured by distance from protective cover) and so the relation between mass and foraging rate was unlikely to have been confounded by any changes in vigilance to compensate for increased mass-dependent predation risk. The results suggest that blackbirds with high relative foraging rates have lower body reserves during the winter. Therefore there is probably a direct link between overwinter condition and fitness at least in blackbirds.

We present the use of digital imaging as a means of both identifying key stink bug egg predators and measuring their relative impact on egg survivorship. Brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys and bagrada bug, Bagrada hilaris, two exotic stink bugs new to California, are now widely distributed throughout the state. A survey was conducted to identify resident natural enemies of their eggs. A field camera aided in the identification of arthropods attacking these eggs and their relative impact. Predation of BMSB eggs, which are naturally oviposited onto plant foliage, was less than for eggs of bagrada bug, which oviposit onto and into soil. The top ranked predators of BMSB eggs were the carabid Laemostenus complanatus (Coleoptera) the European earwig Forficula auricularia and ring-legged earwig Euborellia annulipes (Dermaptera), the oriental cockroach Blatta orientalis (Orthoptera), and the spider Trachelas spp. (Araneae). The two most common and important predators of bagrada bug were two ant species (Formicidae), Solenopsis xyloni and Monomorium ergatogyna, and species of Collembola (Entomobryidae). A Predation Index was developed to compare the relative importance of BMSB egg predators. Lastly, two striking, unanticipated results are reported: an apparent synergistic interaction between the spider Trachelas spp. and native ant M. ergatogyna in causing damage to sentinel eggs of BMSB, and the predaceous role for Collembola on bagrada bug sentinel eggs."

Enclosure design, and choice of group mates as well as routine husbandry events such as feeding, cleaning, and health care are in the hands of human keepers. It is therefore important to understand how external human-related husbandry events affect daily behaviour routines for animals, to help promote good welfare. Predictability (or lack thereof) of these routines can have profound effects on behaviours of captive animals. This study investigates whether providing a reliable predictable signal indicating entry into indoor brown capuchin (Sapajus apella) enclosures can increase welfare. All day focal follows of 12 zoo-housed capuchins were performed, recording behaviour in relation to husbandry events. The Baseline data show that unreliable sounds of door openings and closings outside the enclosure increase anxiety-related behaviours such as self-scratching, vigilance and jerky motions, and that the capuchins were startled by keepers entering the enclosure. A reliable signal (knocking) was subsequently introduced before enclosure entry and the monkeys given two weeks to associate the signal prior to Treatment condition data collection. The results indicate that the anxiety-related behaviours were reduced in the Treatment condition compared to Baseline frequencies. We conclude that making certain husbandry events reliable and predictable through the introduction of a unique signal can have a significant positive impact on the welfare of animals. Such an approach is not time consuming and costs nothing to implement, yet can result in significant advancements in animal welfare that can be implemented in a wide range of captive settings.

We analysed interactions between fallow deer, European roe deer and wild boar, in three sites, in a Mediterranean area. We expected that interference should be greater between deer than between them and wild boar. We documented the negative effects of behavioural interference by fallow on foraging behaviour of roe deer, under field conditions. Deer species built up 90% interference interactions, with fallow always dominant on roe, also through direct aggression. Although roe deer decreased feeding and increased vigilance levels in proximity (< 50 m) of either fallow deer or wild boar, they were displaced significantly more often by the former than by the latter. Fallow deer were neither displaced nor alarmed by roe and rarely by wild boar. No deer species displaced wild boar. Interference was significantly greater on solitary roe deer, especially females, in spring and roe left the feeding ground most often in the smallest site (13 ha). Roe deer avoided areas where the local density of fallow deer was the highest. During our 4-year-study, roe deer density decreased whereas fallow deer numbers increased. Behavioural interference may explain how fallow deer outcompete roe deer through spatial exclusion from feeding sites and avoidance of areas with high densities of the former. Fallow deer evolved in semi-arid, relatively poor habitats of Asia Minor: interspecific defence of crucial resources could have developed as a beneficial tactic for its survival."

We therefore, during November 2019, tested the responses of emperor penguins at the Atka Bay colony (Queen Maud Land). We video recorded the behaviour of adults and chicks during multimtor UAV activity and human approach. There were, in general, only moderate responses with distinct reactions in fewer than 20% of individuals observed. Chicks increased vigilance behaviour during UAV activity but both adults and chicks did so during human approach. We saw the greatest reaction in chicks during vertical UAV approach. Adults showed intermediate reactions to vertical UAV approach but only very few reactions to horizontal flights."

We analysed the microhabitat use of willow tits in winter flocks and assessed possible factors which shape habitat segregation between adults and juveniles in different temperature regimes. When foraging in mild conditions (ambient temperature > 0 degreesC), flocks split up into subgroups with adults foraging in inner parts of trees more often than juveniles. However, no differences were recorded in the vertical position occupied in trees. In harsh conditions (< - 4<degrees>C), flocks re-united and juveniles further moved to outer parts of trees, increasing horizontal segregation between age classes. In mild conditions, vigilance behaviour was not related to the position of birds in trees, but in harsh conditions, scanning frequency was higher in outer parts of trees only for adults. In mild weather, juvenile position in trees was associated with body size and mass. The foraging microhabitat segregation detected in harsh conditions fits the age-related hoarding distribution previously described in the same population. This supports the hypothesis that hoarded food is important in determining future foraging habitat use. Adult preference and intraspecific competition for safer or richer inner parts of trees as foraging sites during harsh conditions seems to determine the habitat segregation between adults and juveniles. Furthermore, we suggest that in mild weather, when foraging in the absence of adults, juveniles balance the costs of using a potentially dangerous microhabitat with the benefits of building energetically cheap and large food reserves through hoarding. The expected patterns of microhabitat segregation may differ in parids, depending on whether predation risk or other factors such as food availability are the main factors controlling habitat quality."

Specifically, prior research has proposed that self-determined motivations to be in one's relationship-known as relationship autonomy-are associated with more adaptive relationship functioning. While empirical research has explored the association between relationship autonomy and defensiveness, the link with pro-partner behaviors such as support provision has received relatively little attention. The present research tested, across three studies, whether relationship autonomy is associated with more care for one's partner. Three studies-one cross-sectional, one diary, and one dyadic study-suggest that relationship autonomy is associated with overall supportiveness both in the form of secure base support and basic psychological need support. Additionally, relationship autonomy was associated with less intrusiveness, suggesting that higher relationship autonomy is not simply associated with hyper-vigilance and being overbearing, but rather attention to the partner's needs."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of valence and arousal on lexical decision (LD) by manipulating both dimensions, while controlling correlated psycholinguistic variables (e.g., word length, frequency, imageability). Results showed that valence and arousal affect word recognition in an interactive way: LD latencies are slower for positive high-arousal and negative low-arousal words compared to positive low-arousal and negative high-arousal words, in line with an approach-withdrawal tendency model. Furthermore, principal component and regression analyses revealed a unique contribution of a cluster of emotion variables, independent of lexico-semantic variables, to explaining LD latencies. We conclude that emotional valence and arousal both need to be taken into account in studies of word processing as they show an interactive relationship."

Eating and non-eating behaviors were measured during five consecutive test sessions under stressful noise (95 dB white noise, n=18) and control conditions (60 dB white noise, n = 18). Two thirds of the stressed rats were classified as normophagic, one third showed hypophagic responses. Hypophagic rats spent less time eating and more time grooming and resting than normophagic and control rats. Hypophagic rats also showed an increased tendency of scanning movements during eating and an increased tendency to leave the food area. Their eating speed was significantly lower than that of the normophagic rats. Hypophagic rats were characterized by a heightened reactivity to stressors which may have counteracted the adaptation to the stressful feeding situation. Results point to a role of biological factors for individual differences in stress-induced changes of eating. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

Functional investigations have ascertained that individuals obtain some antipredator benefits without paying the costs of intra-species resource competition. Despite these advances, very little is known about the subtle mechanisms that keep mixed species groups together on a daily basis. Our results showed that in the Diana-Campbell's monkey association both species benefited from each other in diverse and idiosyncratic ways. In the presence of Campbell's monkeys the conspicuous Diana monkeys were more likely to descend into the lower forest strata, increased their foraging behaviour, and individuals became less vigilant. The cryptic Campbell's monkeys, in turn, were able to use the higher forest strata and exposed areas more often, spread out over larger areas, were more likely to travel, and engaged in more conspicuous vocal behaviour when associated with Diana monkeys. These data suggested that both species benefited from each other in ways that went beyond passive group-size related antipredator benefits, such as a dilution effect and increased chances of predator detection. Instead, the increased safety of the mixed species group allowed individuals to exploit their ecological niche more broadly, to forage more efficiently, and to engage in more social behaviour, suggesting that the benefits of mixed species groups are much more varied and diverse than currently thought."

We studied antipredator behavior of three Tasmanian macropodid marsupials Forester kangaroos Macropus giganteus, Bennett's wallabies M. rufogriseus, and Tasmanian pademelons Thylogale billardierii - to understand how antipredator behavior functions in a relatively intact predator community. We also compared behavior of the kangaroos and wallabies on a predator-free island where they were translocated from mainland Tasmania 30 yr ago. Both species allowed humans to get closer to them on the predator-free island; a finding consistent with a reduced risk of predation on the island. Neither kangaroos, nor wallabies, exhibited group size effects - they did not modify time allocated to foraging or antipredator vigilance as a function of group size at either site. Nor did overall time allocation vary in any consistent way. In contrast, mainland Australian sibling-species of Forester kangaroos and Bennett's wallabies have both been reported to have group size effects. It is possible either that the extinction of the thylacine Thylacinus cynocephalus in the last century has led to an evolutionary loss of group size effects and other antipredator behavior, or that thylacines were never that important a predator on Tasmanian subspecies. In contrast, Tasmanian pademelons studied on the Tasmanian mainland modified time allocation as a function of group size suggesting that they perceived safety in numbers. Pademelons, because of their body size, are relatively more vulnerable than larger-bodied macropodids to the rich community of marsupial carnivores in Tasmania, and used a mix of social and individual strategies to manage predation risk."

I performed an experiment in which yellowhammers were exposed to a control treatment, where a curtain was moved several times a day, 5 days in a row, and then to a predator treatment, where a perched, stuffed sparrowhawk appeared when the curtain was moved, 5 days in a row Between the two treatments were 2 days without any experimental treatment. The birds were expected to decrease in mass, and/or to change the daily trajectory of mass increase in response to increased predation risk. Yellowhammers decreased in morning mass and evening mass in response to both che moving curtain and the sparrowhawk compared to an untreated day before the start of the experiment. However, the response to both treatments was not the same; in the sparrowhawk treatment the birds waited longer before resuming feeding and lost more weight after each exposure as compared to the curtain treatment. This loss was regained, and yellowhammers increased their intake rate. Due to that, they reduced, although not significantly, the time spent feeding under predation risk. A reduction in the time spent feeding under predation risk reduces the time exposed to predators. However, if an increase in intake rate also incurs a decrease in vigilance, this might increase predation risk. The results of this study, together with other studies, indicate that for yellowhammers a reduction in time exposed to predators might be more important for survival than a reduction in body mass."
"Foster, Shannon; Ijichi, Carrie","The association between infrared thermal imagery of core eye temperature, personality, age and housing in cats",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,189,79,84,10.1016/j.applanim.2017.01.004,2017,"Understanding individual responses to stress is a key aspect of maintaining optimal animal welfare. This is especially important where animals are being kept in sub-optimal environments or where the species may not clearly demonstrate stress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate how stress varies in cats in a cattery environment in association with personality, age and housing. Stress was measured using Infrared Thermal Imaging (IRT) of core eye temperature and compared with scores from the Feline Temperament Profile (FTP), age and single or group housing (n=34). It was predicted that higher eye temperature would be inversely correlated with acceptable scores and directly correlated with questionable scores calculated from the FTP as these are suggested to indicate a stress sensitive cat. As predicted, eye temperature correlated significantly with acceptable FTP scores (rs = -0.377, p = 0.028). Eye temperature was also higher in older cats (rs = 0.417, p = 0.014) and those singly-housed compared with group housed (U = 37, N1 = 12, N2 = 22, P = 0.001). This provides preliminary evidence that personality may predict stress sensitivity in cats and that older and singly housed cats may find the cattery environment more aversive. These findings may improve adoption rates as unresolved stress can cause avoidance and aggressive behaviour, both of which are undesirable in companion animals. Further, they may increase adoption success rates if owners have more knowledge of the personality and likely stress sensitivity of the cat before adopting. In addition, educating owners that the cat they have adopted is stress sensitive will encourage greater vigilance and awareness of subtle indicators of stress, thus improving welfare.

Our goal was to assess the influence of individual characteristics and extrinsic factors on the activity budget of marked adult female mountain goats, Oreamnos americanus. As lactation entails important energetic costs, we specifically aimed at contrasting activity budgets of lactating and nonlactating females. We determined female activity budgets using 10-min interval scan sampling between 2002 and 2005. Lactating females, females raising sons and females that were subordinate for their age spent more time foraging than nonlactating females, females raising daughters and dominant females, respectively. Although foraging is typically incompatible with scanning, increased time spent foraging was mainly performed at the expense of time spent lying rather than time spent in vigilance. Lactating females also increased time spent ruminating while lying compared with nonlactating females. All females traded lying time for increased foraging and ruminating times in early and late summer. Females spent less time foraging on warm days, and foraged more at dusk than during the rest of the day. Age and body mass did not influence female activity budgets. Our results indicate that lactating females partly compensated for the costs of lactation by trading lying for foraging time, and reorganized lying time to increase the proportion of time spent ruminating. This study emphasizes the fundamental behavioural trade-offs that female mammals must face to meet their daily energetic requirements and allows a better understanding of how these compromises vary through the lactation period.

Behavioural ecology theory predicts that sensitivity to mortality risks, and thereby to disturbance, will be related to life-history characteristics. Long-lived species with low reproductive rates are expected to have a high cost of predation and therefore avoid risks strongly. In this paper we quantify the effect of roads on the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) using behavioural indicators. We used a pair wise design, offering condors standardized food patches near and far from roads simultaneously The patches consisted of dead adult shee We recorded. p. condors' behaviour when visiting each patch. This study establishes the versatility of behavioural indicators and their usefulness to study conservation problems. We found that, although near and far patches were discovered after similar times and there were similar numbers of condors in the vicinity of near and far patches, the use of patches differed strongly. In the patches far from roads many more condors came to feed, the average time spent per individual was longer, the proportion of time spent vigilant was lower, and the amount of food left uneaten on the carcasses was lower. These results strongly suggest that Andean condors clearly avoid roads, and behave in a way predicted from theory if they trade off safety for energy. This study shows that roads have stronger influence on the habitat use of Andean condors, than previously thought, and may be a significant problem for the species in populated areas.

Young tiger snakes were raised either on a high or low food diet and exposed to a predation threat while foraging. Under these circumstances, lower condition snakes (low food diet) were prone to take additional feeding/foraging risks: food was accepted at a much higher rate compared with the higher condition animals (high food diet) that were less inclined to risk feeding under a predation threat. This study provides the first direct example of predation risk-associated foraging decisions in snakes."

Scanning behaviour is often incorporated in theoretical models using simplifying assumptions in relation to the trade-off in information gathering between body postures (head-up versus head-down); however, some avian visual systems may allow individuals to scan in both body postures. We studied these issues experimentally, using starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, foraging in enclosures on natural fields. We varied the availability of information from conspecifics by placing visual barriers that blocked the view when the subjects were in head-down position and by manipulating the distance between group members. We found that as social information was reduced, starlings spent more time scanning (on and off the ground) and head-up scanning was mainly oriented towards conspecifics. The visual-obstruction effects imply that some information about conspecifics is normally gathered while starlings are foraging head-down. Neighbour distance and visual obstruction negatively affected food-searching rates and intake rates in two ways: (1) the effect of obstruction was mediated mostly through time competition between foraging and scanning on the ground, and (2) the effect of distance was due to a reduction in the rate of prey returns per searching effort while the birds were head-down. We conclude that the head-up posture is only one component of scanning, that the effects of head-down scanning should also be considered in species with ample visual fields, and that scanning in starlings is strongly connected to monitoring other flock members.

"Kloppers, EL; St Clair, CC; Hurd, TE",Predator-resembling aversive conditioning for managing habituated wildlife,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,10,,,,2005,"Wildlife habituation near urban centers can disrupt natural ecological processes, destroy habitat, and threaten public safety. Consequently, management of habituated animals is typically invasive and often includes translocation of these animals to remote areas and sometimes even their destruction. Techniques to prevent or reverse habituation and other forms of in situ management are necessary to balance ecological and social requirements, but they have received very little experimental attention to date. This study compared the efficacy of two aversive conditioning treatments that used either humans or dogs to create sequences resembling chases by predators, which, along with a control category, were repeatedly and individually applied to 24 moderately habituated, radio-collared elk in Banff National Park during the winter of 2001-2002. Three response variables were measured before and after treatment. Relative to untreated animals, the distance at which elk fled from approaching humans, i.e., the flight response distance, increased following both human and dog treatments, but there was no difference between the two treatments. The proportion of time spent in vigilance postures decreased for all treatment groups, without differences among groups, suggesting that this behavior responded mainly to seasonal effects. The average distance between elk locations and the town boundary, measured once daily by telemetry, significantly increased for human-conditioned elk. One of the co-variates we measured, wolf activity, exerted counteracting effects on conditioning effects; flight response distances and proximity to the town site were both lower when wolf activity was high. This research demonstrates that it is possible to temporarily modify aspects of the behavior of moderately habituated elk using aversive conditioning, suggests a method for reducing habituation in the first place, and provides a solution for Banff and other jurisdictions to manage hyperabundant and habituated urban wildlife."

Focal and scan samples of marked animals were used to determine the context of signalling, and to establish the behavioural concomitants of flagging in the signaller and potential perceivers. Both pups and adults invariably use this signal when encountering a snake, but both tail flag more often when there is no obvious elicitor (Hersek & Owings 1993, Anim. Behav., 45, 129-138). When no snake was present, pups used tail flagging in tonic communication, as adults did. Although tail flagging by adult females was related to the vulnerability of pups, signalling by both adult males and pups reflected their own vulnerability. Tail flagging by adult males and pups differed, however, in its effects on perceivers. Adult males induced nearby animals to maintain higher levels of snake vigilance, while tail flagging by pups induced others to remain nearby. Pups distinguished more clearly between contexts of tail flagging than did adults. Both pups and adults tail flagged more frequently on days when snakes were on the site (than when snakes were absent), but this difference was greater for pups than for adults. Pups were also more likely than adults to pair tail flagging with calling while dealing directly with snakes (as contrasted with flagging when no snake was present). Overall, the differences between pups and adults appear to fit an age-specific interpretation of ontogeny. Pup use of tail flagging seems appropriate for their developmental stage, and does not simply reflect an incompletely developed signalling system."

In extreme cases, such alterations may have serious demographic consequences, and recent studies support that non-lethal effects of predation may have broad ecological consequences. However, behavioural and physiological responses to predation risk may be related to trade-offs associated with resource acquisition and direct predation risk. We validated an enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) for non-invasive monitoring of stress in plains zebras (Equus quagga) from faecal material. We used this assay in combination with behavioural data to assess if plains zebras living with and without lions (Panthera leo) in a mountain savannah in southern Africa differed in behaviour and physiology, and if such differences were influenced by seasons with contrasting resource availability. Zebra group sizes did not differ between areas with and without lions, but zebra groups had more juveniles in an area with lions than groups in an area without lions, but only during the wet season. Similarly, we observed differences in individual vigilance, foraging behaviour and stress hormone concentrations, but all these differences were influenced by seasons. Despite these seasonal influences, our study did not suggest that zebras in an area with lions spent a higher proportion of time being vigilant, a lower proportion of time foraging, or had higher stress hormone levels. Our results instead suggest that zebras' responses to lion presence were highly context dependent and the result of complex interactions between resource abundance and cues about predation risk. Because of the obvious ecological and evolutionary ramifications of such findings, we argue that further research is needed to define the spatial and temporal scales over which predators impose indirect effects on their prey."

In the UK, over-wintered stubbles are an important foraging habitat for farmland birds, many of which are of current conservation concern. Maximizing the value of stubbles for farmland birds has largely focused on increasing food abundance but has ignored other aspects of foraging behaviour, such as predator avoidance and vigilance.2. In this study we investigated the effects of stubble height reduction on seed depletion and the within-field distribution of farmland birds. Stubble on one half of each of 20 fields was topped to lower vegetation height, while the other half was left untouched to act as a control area.3. The abundance of granivorous passerines and invertebrate feeders was higher on treatment plots, which had undergone stubble height reduction, while the abundance of skylark and partridges was higher on control plots. Topping had no effect on the within-field distribution of either corvids or pigeons.4. Seed densities on both plot types fell between November and March, but there was no significant difference in levels of depletion between treatment and control plots.5. For many species, food accessibility and detectability are likely to have been higher, and thermo-energetic and mobility costs lower, on treatment plots. Stubble height reduction could have led to either an increase or a decrease in associated predation risk, depending on the predator escape strategy of a species. Granivorous passerines, which flee to cover, are likely to have benefited from the reduced visual obstruction on treatment plots, while partridges, which rely on crypsis, will have benefited from the greater protection offered by the longer vegetation in control plots.6. Synthesis and applications. Increasing the structural heterogeneity of over-wintered stubble is likely to increase its value as a foraging habitat, making it better suited to the foraging requirements and predator escape strategies of a greater diversity of species. Incorporating explicit management options into agri-environment schemes, such as the new Environmental Stewardship Scheme, may represent a cost-effective strategy to achieve this."

The predator-attraction hypothesis predicts that predators will be attracted by frequent vocalizations, whereas cowbirds will parasitize nests with relatively quiet parents and less predation risk; thus, vireos will experience trade-offs between reticence and vigilance in mediating specific risks. The parasite-assessment hypothesis predicts that vireos will become more secretive as local cowbird densities increase. Vireo vocalization response to nest predation and parasitism risk interacted with nest stage, and we found little evidence of risk mediation through vocalizations except during the building stage. Vireos, however, did benefit overall by optimizing temporal patterns in vocalizations. Vireo nests were less likely to be depredated or parasitized if males vocalized most during laying and least during the middle of the day. Birds vocalized more during the midday and less during the laying period when local cowbird densities were higher, however, perhaps demonstrating limited plasticity in social communication."

Storks behaved as central place foragers, gathering in flocks to feed. Travel distance and patch residence time were positively correlated with the size of the foraging flock, but not with patch quality as estimated by the instantaneous food intake rate at the patch. Parch residence time was also positively correlated with travel distance to the patch, flock size being constant. In larger flocks individuals benefitted from a decrease in vigilance time and thus an increase in time spent actively feeding, which enabled birds to bring back to the nest a higher load size. These results suggest that storks followed simple rules of thumb based on flock size, rather than on the more complicated food availability estimations required by central place foraging models. We suggest that flock size could be the main cue used in foraging decisions by white storks and could be a simple rule for many other flock foraging species."
"Ryer, CH",Laboratory evidence for behavioural impairment of fish escaping trawls: a review,ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,61,1157,1164,10.1016/j.icesjms.2004.06.004,2004,"It is now widely accepted that for some species a proportion of the undersized fish escaping trawl codends die as a direct result of stress, with 10% to 30% mortality commonly cited. It has also been suggested that there may be indirect or behaviourally mediated mortality; fish that encounter and escape the trawl, only to experience stress-induced behavioural deficits and succumb to predators in the hours or days afterwards. The goal of this review was to evaluate the plausibility of this behaviourally mediated, yet unobserved mortality. Three laboratory studies utilizing cod (Gadus morhua), walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) have assayed for behavioural impairment in fish following application of stressors designed to simulate entrainment and escape from trawls. Where impairments in anti-predator capabilities occurred, it was determined that trawl-stressed fish exhibited reduced swimming speed, reduced shoal cohesion, and reduced predator vigilance compared to control fish. Although stressed fish appeared to rapidly recover their ability to avoid being eaten by predators, measurements of more subtle aspects of escapee behaviour suggest that impairments may persist for days after stressor application. Although these studies demonstrate that more investigation is required, when combined with a more extensive literature demonstrating that a variety of stressors can impair fish anti-predator behaviour, it is reasonable to conclude that many fish species escaping trawl codends will likely suffer behavioural deficits that subject them to elevated predation risk. As such, there is probably mortality associated with trawl fisheries that is generally unrecognized, unmeasured, and unaccounted for in current stock assessment models. Further, these studies demonstrate that behavioural competency needs to be considered in the design and implementation of by-catch reduction devises and strategies.

We propose that in plants dispersed by scatter-hoarding granivores, seed trait evolution may have been driven by selective pressures that arise from interactions between seedling shade intolerance and predator-mediated caching behavior. Using an optimal foraging model that accounts for cache concealment, hoarder memory, and perceived predation risk, we show that hoarders can obtain cache-recovery advantages by placing caches in moderately risky locations that force potential pilferers to engage in high levels of vigilance. Our model also demonstrates that the level of risk needed to optimally protect a cache increases with the value of the cached food item. If hoarders perceive less sheltered, high-light conditions to be more risky and use this information to protect their caches, then shade-intolerant plants may increase their fitness by producing seeds with traits valued by hoarders. Consistent with this hypothesis, shade tolerance in scatter-hoarded tree species is inversely related to the value of their seeds as perceived by a scatter-hoarding rodent."

Pups comprised >27% of the samples after a synchronous March - April 1992 birth event in which about 50% of the adult females participated. The timing and frequency of parturition in the two species are in response to a unimodal temporal distribution of rainfall with a historical peak from December to January. Births coincided with a heavy March rainfall after and before extended periods without rain. Litter size seemed little affected by the drought. Sixteen of 19 nurseries were communal, and six (37,5%) of these, heterospecific. Reproductive individuals may conserve energy as the effectiveness of vigilance increases with group size, especially for heterospecific groups. Extreme predation pressure in the MNP may be a selective agent favouring synchronous parturition and cooperative behaviour by the two species of hyrax."

There were five different nest types combined in groups of three in 30 cases. Type A nest: made with natural bush plants tied together at one end and placed invertedly forming a cone. Type B: made with the same natural bush plants as the previous type but placed over an internal wire structure and having preformed entrances. Type C: a wooden structure in the form of a roof with two slopes. Type D: similar to the type C but on one of the laterals the opaque material only covers the upper half, and a plastic mesh covers the lower half. Type E: a wooden square box covered with an inclined plank of opaque and waterproof material. Our study shows that the type A nest received significantly (P<0.05) more eggs than the others, possibly because this type of nest allowed for better vigilance an da better sense of protection for the animals. Type E nest was the second most preferred. In this type, th partridge was able to monitor the surroundings through the space between the walls and the roof and this space could be used as an escape route.

Knowledge of which species are actually preferred and which are avoided is lacking, however, as is an understanding of why such preference or avoidance may arise. An analysis of 32 studies over 48 different spatial locations or temporal periods throughout the distribution of the lion shows that it preferentially preys upon species within a weight range of 190-550 kg. The most preferred weight of lion prey is 350 kg. The mean mass of significantly preferred prey species is 290 kg and of all preferred species is 201 kg. Gemsbok, buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe and zebra are significantly preferred. Species outside the preferred weight range are generally avoided. Species within the preferred weight range that are not significantly preferred (such as roan, sable and eland) generally have features that reduce predation either morphologically (e.g. sable horns), ecologically (e.g. roan and sable occurring at low density), or behaviourally (e.g. the large herd size and increased vigilance of eland). Warthog are below the preferred weight range yet are taken in accordance with their availability and this is probably due to their sympatry with lion, their relatively slow evasion speed and their lower level of vigilance. Plots of prey preference against prey body mass follows a bell curve with a right skew that, we argue, is caused by collective hunting by lions of larger-bodied prey. Our methods can be used on all large predators and are likely to be useful in assessing competition in sympatric communities of predators, cooperative hunting and predicting predator diets. This will allow us to move beyond descriptive dietary studies to improve our predictive understanding of the mechanisms underlying predator-prey interactions."

This relationship is most evident at persistent kills where dominant competitors are attracted to both the carcass (as a free meal) and to the killers (as potential prey). Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are frequent victims of kleptoparasitism, and cubs, and sometimes adults, are killed by lions (Panthera leo) or spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Between 1980 and 2002, we observed 639 kills made by cheetahs in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. These kills were often visited by scavengers, including relatively innocuous species such as vultures and jackals and potentially dangerous species, like spotted hyenas and lions. We used cheetah behavior at kills to test a number of predictions about how cheetahs should minimize risk at kill sites given they face an increased risk of predation of themselves or their cubs. In particular, we examined the propensity of cheetahs of different age/sex classes to hide carcasses after making a kill, vigilance at kills, and the delay in leaving after finishing feeding with respect to ecological factors and scavenger presence. The behavior of single females at kills did not suggest that they were trying to avoid being killed, but the behavior of males, often found in groups, was in line with this hypothesis. In contrast, the behavior of mother cheetahs at kills appeared to be influenced greatly by the risk of cubs being killed. Our results suggest that cheetahs use several behavioral counterstrategies to avoid interspecific predation of self or cubs."
"Beauchamp, G",The effect of group size on mean food intake rate in birds,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS OF THE CAMBRIDGE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,73,449,472,10.1017/S0006323198005246,1998,"A description of the relationship between mean food intake rate (MFIR) and group size is important in assessing the adaptiveness of group living in animals. Several hypotheses argue that foraging in groups can be beneficial in terms of MFIR but an overall assessment of the evidence available thus far was lacking. I examined this relationship in birds using studies that provided a measure of MFIR in groups of different sizes and evaluated the effect of study design and food type. In addition, I noted some of the mechanisms thought to be responsible for changes in MFIR with group size and quantified the impact of the addition of individual foragers. The most common pattern of change in MFIR with group size was a monotonic increase. The different patterns of change in MFIR with group size occurred with similar frequencies in experimental and observational studies despite the fact that observational studies often lacked control for confounding factors. Increases in MFIR were more likely to be associated with seeds as a food type than with fish or invertebrates, and were least likely with carcasses. This finding was related to the ease with which individuals can use aggression to increase their share of resources that are more concentrated in space. Adjustments in vigilance levels and aggression, as well as more subtle changes in speed of search and handling time, were correlated with changes in MFIR with group size. Finally, the addition of three to four individuals appeared to be needed to double the MFIR of a solitary bird. The results suggest that foraging in avian groups is often associated with increased MFIRs and that several ecological factors, including food dispersion, influence the pattern of change with group size."
"Sharp, Alexander R.; Islam, Kamal",Does the intrusion of an avian nest predator elicit a change in the behaviour of a canopy-nesting passerine?,BEHAVIOUR,158,503,528,10.1163/1568539X-bja10078,2021,"Many studies have shown that nest predators affect their prey indirectly by inducing changes in the behaviour of the prey. Studies suggest that the type and degree of nest defence strategies depends heavily on species, along with nest type and location. One such strategy, nest vigilance, allows individuals to collect information and make informed decisions based on their surroundings. In this study, we simulated the intrusion of a common avian nest predator (blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata) into the territory of nesting cerulean warblers (Setophaga cerulea) and evaluated eight different behavioural variables to determine their response to the nest predator. Female cerulean warblers were more vigilant on their nest when exposed to a potential predator compared to a nest with lower threat of predation. Females exposed to a nest predator increased incubation bout by 109% and brooding bout by 60%. Our data also suggest that male cerulean warblers reduce their provisioning rate during the early nestling stage (-1 feeding/hour) and late nestling stage (-3 feedings/hour), although more data are needed. Modification of incubation bout length and nestling provisioning rate are common strategies employed by songbirds to reduce activity around the nest, by decreasing detection opportunities of visually-oriented nest predators. Currently, the only understanding we have on how cerulean warblers respond to a nest predator is based on observational data. The results of this study provide the first evidence that cerulean warblers are able to identify species that pose a threat to the safety of their nest, and that they modify their behaviour to reduce nest detection by predators. The results of this study provide a better understanding of a relatively unknown aspect of the breeding behaviour of this species. This study is also first to describe how an open-cup, canopy-nesting species responds to an increase in nest predation threat."

Fifty-six healthy young adults (mean age = 20 years) were allocated to groups (n(1-4) = 14) according to their level of excrcise (more than 6 h aerobic exercise per wk. or sedentary(1)) and smoking (more than 10 cigarettes per day, or none) behaviour. Participants performed two free recall tasks, one under normal physically inactive conditions and the other immediately following strenuous physical exertion (a step-up test for 2 min). We predicted that recall would suffer following strenuous physical activity smoking, aerobic exercisers. We reasoned this would be due to the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood being compromised in this group by higher levels of smoking-related carbon inoiloxide in the blood stream. The results supported this prediction. We interpret our findings according, to a resources model of cognitive function, mediated by physiological mechanisms. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd."

Circadian fluctuations of experimentally induced emotionality have been reported from murine models (Poirel, 1982). Further research into rhythmometric investigations revealed that the temporal organization of emotional life expressed two oscillatory circadian systems. The circadian fluctuations that were rhythmometrically detected and compared expressed a noticeable phase concordance between the temporal periodicities related to vigilance and to indicators of basic emotionality. In contrast, the rhythmometric data for behavioral responses of emotionality displayed a marked phase displacement of the psychological circadian patterns and tended to manifest a functional dissociation between behavioral and visceral modalities of reactional events.Such experiments provide a quantitative approach for a better functional understanding of cerebral mechanisms regulating the time of the occurrence of stress-related events and make it possible to take into consideration the development of new heuristic concepts in psychology and comparative chronobiology.More specifically, the chronopsychological organization of emotional life with its two asynchronous components, as well as the multimodal oscillations that we have proposed, opens the discussion to new concepts of order by fluctuation and the consideration of chaotic systems governing psychological events of emotionality."

Men partnered to more attractive women perform more mate retention behaviors - behaviors designed to thwart a woman's infidelity. With greater risk of female infidelity, men may perform additional anti-cuckoldry tactics such as frequent in-pair copulations (IPC). We secured self-reports from 277 men in a long-term relationship and investigated: (1) the relationship between female partner's attractiveness and IPC frequency and (2) the mediating role of female partner's attractiveness on the relationship between IPC frequency and male mate retention behaviors. The results indicated that female attractiveness: (I) predicts IPC frequency and (2) partially mediates the relationship between IPC frequency and male mate retention behaviors.

In response, we aim to integrate cross-disciplinary evidence to suggest that various forms of sleep disruption release aggressive impulses and fuel violence. Method: In a narrative review, we outline 3 pathways of influence from sleep disruption to aggression that involve compromised affective, cognitive, and response-control processes. We also consider the reciprocal influences between sleep disruption and aggression, as well as review 3 domains where sleep disruption may have especially important effects on aggression and violence and provide opportunities for intervention. Results: The review reveals that sleep problems may be important contributors to aggression, especially in the domains involving intimate partner violence, school and cyber bullying, and institutional aggression within psychiatric and correctional institutions. Conclusion: Reviewed evidence has essential theoretical and applied importance for understanding and preventing conflict and violence in society. Finally, it calls for much-needed research targeting the role of sleep in aggression and social behavior."

Building on the notion that narcissists (in contrast to individuals with a proneness to Machiavellianism or psychopathy) possess a preference for being superior and a propensity to dominate other individuals, it is assumed that the dominance-related hormone testosterone is positively associated with narcissism. It is additionally assumed that narcissism specifically is positively related to basal cortisol levels given narcissists' vigilance and sensitivity regarding their social esteem and status which is linked to cortisol activity. In a study including 129 men from the subclinical population, (M-age = 21.97, range = 18 to 34 years), a positive correlation of narcissism with basal testosterone levels was found. Narcissism was also positively correlated with basal cortisol levels. No significant relations emerged for Machiavellianism or psychopathy. In sum, the present contribution suggests that dark personality traits, in this case narcissism, are expressed in the endocrinology of individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In the degraded forest there were fewer social groups of smaller average group size and lower population density. Differences in habitat quality, patchiness and intensity of human activities between the two localities are reflected in macaque activity patterns. In the degraded forest the animals allocate less time to feeding, foraging (clumped food resources, smaller group sizes) and Vigilance (more habituated to human presence). They allocate more time to resting and they are involved more frequently in grooming (probably an indication of social tension within groups).

We estimate 42 cm of maximum subsidence during the period of interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations, and a maximum of 1 m or more subsidence, since the end of the construction phase of the reclamation project. A hyperbolic model was used to relate the three independent time series and to estimate the nonlinear behavior of subsidence. The model estimates a maximum subsidence rate and acceleration of -5.7 cm/year and 1.1 cm/year(2), respectively. The decomposition of vertical and east-west horizontal motion using the Sentinel-1 dataset indicates relatively weak partial horizontal displacement as well as substantial vertical deformation overall. The long-term time series analysis indicates ongoing ground subsidence, although almost two decades have passed since the completion of reclamation.Plain Language Summary Ground subsidence is a process that may threaten human lives and property, and it often occurs owing to the compaction of alluvial sediments as a result of groundwater extraction or soil consolidation. In particular, coastal reclaimed land composed of soft materials such as sand or soil, rather than massive rock, is vulnerable to subsidence. We used three data sets comprising interferometric radar images from two satellites to monitor ground subsidence over time in Busan, South Korea, from 2007 to 2019. We noted not only vertical surface displacement in the overall area, which was expected, but also local displacement in the horizontal direction in specific areas. A hyperbolic model was used to estimate the vertical movement over time due to subsidence, instead of a constant subsidence model. The model results indicate ongoing ground subsidence in the study area, although almost 20 years have passed since the completion of reclamation."

Data collected from 174 Singaporeans supported the hypothesized relationships among Chinese values, defensive pessimism, SARS-related fears, compliance to preventive health-related behaviors and negative outcomes. Path analysis revealed that individuals' endorsement of Chinese value clusters - prudence, industry, and civic harmony - positively predicted their levels of defensive pessimism. The results also indicated that defensive pessimism had a direct positive effect on SARS-related fears and, SARS-related fears, in turn, were directly related to direct preventive health-related behaviors but not related to indirect preventive behaviors. In addition to the indirect effect of Chinese values on direct preventive health-related behaviors, Chinese values had a direct positive effect on both direct and indirect preventive health-related behaviors. Consistent with our contention that defensive pessimism has the potential for leading to particular negative outcomes, defensive pessimism was found to influence negative outcomes but this relationship was partially mediated by SARS-related fears."

However, no study to date has directly compared cognition in individuals who have a clear disposition for either cognitive or behavioural ER strategies. The present study compared selective attention to angry faces in groups of high trait-suppressors (people who are hiding emotional reactions in response to emotional challenge) and high trait-reappraisers (people who cognitively reinterpret emotional events). Since reappraisers are also low trait-anxious and suppressors are high trait-anxious, high and low anxious control groups, both being low in trait-ER, were also included. Attention to angry faces was assessed using an emotional dot-probe task. Trait-reappraisers and high-anxious individuals both showed attentional biases towards angry faces. Trait-reappraisers' vigilance for angry faces was significantly more pronounced compared to both trait-suppressors and low anxious controls. We suggest that threat prioritization in high trait-reappraisal may allow deeper cognitive processing of threat information without being associated with psychological maladjustment.

Collective risk-monitoring in groups,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,43,168,179,10.1016/j.jesp.2006.02.003,2007,"The importance of risk-monitoring has been increasing in many key aspects of our modern lives. This paper examines how individuals monitor such risks collectively by extending a behavioral ecological model of animal foraging to human groups. Just as animals must forage for food under predatory risk, humans must divide valuable material and psychological resources between foraging activity and risk-monitoring activity. We predicted that game-theoretic aspects of the group situation complicate such a trade-off decision in resource allocation, eventually yielding a mixed equilibrium in a group. When the equilibrium is reached, only a subset of members engage in the risk-monitoring activity while others free-ride, concentrating mainly on their own foraging activity. Laboratory groups engaging in foraging under moderate risk provided a support to this prediction, When the risk-level was set higher, however, herding behavior (conforming to the dominant behavior) interfered with the emergence of equilibrium. Implications for risk management are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

It was originally identified in southern Italy emerging from Gonocerus acuteangulatus (Goeze) eggs and successively recorded also from Spain. Recently O. gonoceri emerged from sentinel egg batches of Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera Pentatomidae) in central Italy. Due to the scanty data on this species, biological and demographic parameters of O. gonoceri were investigated under laboratory conditions on the alternative host Graphosoma italicum italicum (Muller) (Hemiptera Pentatomidae). Estimated fecundity was over 200 eggs/female and the mean progeny production per female was high (173.76 specimens). At the standard rearing condition (26 degrees C) the development time of both sexes was similar and adults emerged after two weeks. Moreover O. gonoceri females lived much longer than males and the host feeding behaviour resulted irrelevant for the parasitoid longevity. The main biological parameters of O. gonoceri were similar to those reported for other cogeneric species. However, this species appeared to be a very effective egg parasitoid if compared with Ooencyrtus telenomicida (Vassiliev) reared on the same host."

When investigating animal presence, however, few detections will suffice to establish an animal's presence within a certain time frame. In this study, we assess detection range and its impacting factors with a novel approach aimed towards studies making use of binary presence/absence metrics. The probability of determining presence of an acoustic transmitter within a certain time frame is calculated as the probability of detecting a set minimum number of transmissions within that time frame. We illustrate this method for hourly and daily time bins with an extensive empirical dataset of sentinel transmissions and detections in a receiver array in a Belgian offshore wind farm. Results The accuracy and specificity of over 84% for both temporal resolutions showed the developed approach performs adequately. Using this approach, we found important differences in the predictive performance of distinct hypothetical range testing scenarios. Finally, our results demonstrated that the probability of determining presence over distance to a receiver did not solely depend on environmental and technical conditions, but would also relate to the temporal resolution of the analysis, the programmed transmitting interval and the movement behaviour of the tagged animal. The probability of determining presence differed distinctly from a single transmission's detectability, with an increase of up to 266 m for the estimated distance at 50% detection probability (D-50). Conclusion When few detections of multiple transmissions suffice to ascertain presence within a time bin, predicted range differs distinctly from the probability of detecting a single transmission within that time bin. We recommend the use of more rigorous range testing methodologies for acoustic telemetry applications where the assessment of detection range is an integral part of the study design, the data analysis and the interpretation of results."

We collected tissue samples for genetic analyses on five breeding colonies in the western Pacific Ocean (Japan) and on 13 colonies in the eastern Pacific Ocean (California to Alaska), and deployed light-level geolocator tags on 12 eastern Pacific colonies to delineate wintering areas. Geolocator tags were deployed previously on one colony in Japan. There was strong genetic differentiation between populations in the eastern vs. western Pacific Ocean, likely due to two factors. First, glaciation over the North Pacific in the late Pleistocene might have forced a southward range shift that historically isolated the eastern and western populations. And second, deep-ocean habitat along the northern continental shelf appears to act as a barrier to movement; abundant on both sides of the North Pacific, the rhinoceros auklet is virtually absent as a breeder in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, and no tagged birds crossed the North Pacific in the non-breeding season. While genetic differentiation was strongest between the eastern vs. western Pacific, there was also extensive differentiation within both regional groups. In pairwise comparisons among the eastern Pacific colonies, the standardized measure of genetic differentiation (F?ST) was negatively correlated with the extent of spatial overlap in wintering areas. That result supports the hypothesis that segregation in the non-breeding season is linked to genetic structure. Philopatry and a neritic foraging habit probably also contribute to the structuring. Widely distributed, vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors, and exhibiting extensive genetic structure, the rhinoceros auklet is fully indicative of the scope of the conservation challenges posed by seabirds."
"MCWILLIAMS, SR; DUNN, JP; RAVELING, DG",PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN EAGLES AND CACKLING CANADA AND ROSS GEESE DURING WINTER IN CALIFORNIA,WILSON BULLETIN,106,272,288,,1994,"Cackling Geese (Branta canadensis minima) were preyed on heavily in northeastern California by Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) and less commonly by Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in 1985-1990. Eagle predation on Cackling Geese was minimal in other wintering locations in California. In the Klamath Basin, eagles killed Cackling Geese most frequently soon (< 10 days) after the geese arrived in the fall. Eagles killed fewer Cackling Geese in the Klamath Basin when Cackling Geese were less common than Ross' Geese (Chen rossii) and Lesser Snow Geese (C. caerulescens caerulescens). We also examined spatial and temporal (daily, seasonal, and annual) variation in eagle predation on geese at a smaller scale in Big Valley, California. Most eagle-caused flushes of geese occurred during mid-day when the geese were using traditional day-roost sites. Roosting on water with most other Cackling and Ross' Geese in Big Valley reduced the frequency of eagle attacks relative to other sites. In Big Valley, the larger Great Basin Canada Goose (Branta canadensis moffitti) was attacked by Golden Eagles only once during 88 observation days, while the smaller Cackling and Ross' geese were attacked by Golden Eagles a total of 27 times. Moreover, Cackling Geese in Big Valley were attacked and killed at least twice as often as Ross' Geese because Cackling Geese often grazed in pasture where Golden Eagle attacks were more frequent. When feeding on pasture, geese did not increase time spent vigilant or flock size compared to habitats with less eagle predation. The antipredator behavior of Cackling Geese includes maintaining high levels of vigilance, occurring in large, dense flocks, and roosting on water during nonfeeding periods. When attacked by eagles, Cackling Geese used socially-coordinated and speed-based escape tactics."

In this paper we investigate the costs and benefits of desertion for females. Desertion incurs a cost for females: following desertion chick survival in broods is lower (0.95 +/- 0.02 day(-1)) than before the female deserts (0.98 +/- 0.01 day(-1)). We investigated several possible causes for reduced brood survival by comparing characteristics of broods before and after desertion (controlling for differences in brood age). After desertion males increased the time they spent foraging and they tended to reduce time spent brooding chicks. Increased mortality of chicks may occur in deserted broods because following desertion (1) males spend less time alert in vigilance behaviour than before desertion, (2) they attend the chicks from greater distances, and (3) they show greater distraction display distances (in response to human intruders). Growth or development of chicks, measured by weight gain and tarsus length, was not different before and after desertion. Females gain two potential benefits from desertion: (1) they may remate and produce a second brood within the same breeding season or (2) they may enhance their probability of surviving to breed in a subsequent season. At least 27% of female kentish plovers that deserted remated and renested in the same season in this study. In contrast, we found no evidence that brood desertion increased the survival of females: there was no difference in local survival rate (return rate) for females deserting before or after 6 days brood age. These results clearly demonstrate that female kentish plovers that desert their offspring prior to fledging incur costs, but we suggest that there is a trade-off with the potential benefits gained by remating and making a second breeding attempt in the same season."

The Ornate Tinamou (Nothoprocta ornata), a species of the central Andes that is important for cynegetic and biomonitoring purposes, was previously reported to have a very small territory (2.43 ha). This was based solely on field observations. In order to gain a better understanding of the movement patterns, home range size, and home range overlap of this species, we radio tracked 12 adult individuals in an Andean agro-ecosystem for a full year. The birds remained within their home ranges all year; 100% MCP (minimum convex polygon) home ranges were 43.8 +/- 21.6 ha (22-85 ha), 95% kernel home ranges were 58.8 +/- 31.9 ha (25-118 ha) and 50% kernel core areas were 15.3 +/- 8.9 ha (6-33 ha). Only two birds, probably sub-adults, showed extensive movement patterns before their death. Individuals overlapped their home ranges extensively (from 30 98% with 2-3 tagged individuals), but these values were probably higher because a small proportion of the population was tagged. No sexual differences were detected in home range size or overlap. Our results support the usefulness of Ornate Tinamou as a sentinel species in biomonitoring studies and highlight the need for further research into the philopatric and dispersion behavior of juveniles before planning cynegetic strategies."

Cedrella toona (MR) and Eucalyptus (LH) species served as main roosts for four passerines. For roost one, in all 39 (+/- 0.37) different trees, 188 (+/- 1.89) total number of cavities, 108 (+/- 1.80) productive nests and 20.19 (+/- 0.39) nests per tree were recorded. Concurrently, from three other roosts, similar numerical counts were also made. Roost behaviour of all four birds was also determined. All of the birds depicted varying numbers of short flights, the calls, mobbing, roost exits and returns and breeding scuffles. Seemingly, the short flights and roost exits were apparent regarding the early intervals. Overall, roosting habits were important for all the birds' in their diurnal activities and for achieving the improved sustainability and endurance in the agro-ecosystems."

According to the antipredator hypothesis, hens on high perches can afford to be less vigilant while roosting at night. A total of 120 LSL hens in groups of five were presented a single perch, which was varied in height throughout two subsequent experiments each. In experiment 1, an acoustic noise was played back in the middle of the night. Hens' latencies until reaction and their roosting behaviours shown before disturbance were analysed depending on perch height (30, 90, or 150 cm). In addition, roosting behaviours were recorded throughout the entire experimental nights and differences were analysed in relation to perch height. Experiment 2 focussed on night-time use of single perches offered at ten different heights ranging from 20 cm to 180 cm. In experiment 1, perch height and hens' body orientation towards the source of acoustic noise did not influence reaction latencies (P>0.05). Surprisingly, hens resting with their head forward immediately before playbacks showed a slower reaction (LS-means = 1.27 s) to the acoustic noise than hens resting with their head under the wing (LS-means = 0.71 s, P = 0.004). In contrast, the percentage of hens perching with their head forward during the entire night was higher on low (LS-means = 55.48%) compared to high perches (LS-means = 33.44%, P = 0.001) in experiment 1. In both experiments, perch use increased with rising height up to 90 cm. In experiment 2, hens did not show a preference for roosting on the perch compared to resting on the floor at a perch height of 80 cm or lower. Although hens showed a clear preference to roost on perches higher than 90 cm, their reactions to an acoustic disturbance during night time did not clearly support the antipredator hypothesis. Possibly, perch height may be a crucial factor when hens are searching for an appropriate roosting place before the dark period but may have limited influence on roosting behaviour during the night.

In arid and semi-arid savannas, surface-water resources are scarce and agonistic interactions between elephants and other herbivores have been reported at waterholes, yet surprisingly very little is known about the impact of elephants on the use of waterholes by other herbivores. Here, we test whether when there are elephants at a waterhole, other herbivores (1) do not change their drinking behaviour; (2) spend shorter time around the water because they are disturbed by elephants' presence and consequently have to leave the waterhole area probably without having met their water requirements, or (3) spend more time around the water probably owing to an increase in vigilance activities or because the presence of elephants may signal safety from predators. Results show that all species spend longer time around water when there are elephants at the waterhole, although the difference is not large. Consequently, this study strongly suggests that elephants do not prevent other herbivores from drinking (time at waterholes is not shortened when elephants are around). Further, if the additional time spent to drink is linked to an increased vigilance, the difference is not large, and hence unlikely to affect the population dynamics of other herbivores."

Here, we test whether the long-term risk of encountering lions and the presence of lions in the vicinity influence the behaviour of large African herbivores at waterholes through avoidance of high-risk areas, increases in group size, changes in temporal niche or changes in the time spent in waterhole areas. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes to study the behaviour of nine herbivore species under different risks of encountering lions. We radio-collared 26 lions in the study area which provided the opportunity to monitor whether lions were present during observation sessions and to map longer-term seasonal landscapes of risk of encountering lions. Our results show that the preferred prey species for lions (buffalo, kudu and giraffe) avoided risky waterholes. Group size increased as encounter risk increased for only two species (wildebeest and zebra), but this effect was not strong. Interestingly, buffalo avoided the hours of the day which are dangerous when the long-term and short-term risks of encountering lions were high, and all species showed avoidance of waterhole use at night times when lions were in the vicinity. This illustrates well how prey can make temporal adjustments to avoid dangerous periods coinciding with predator hunting. Additionally, many herbivores spent more time accessing water to drink when the long- and short-term risks of encountering lions were high, and they showed longer potential drinking time when the long-term risk of encountering lions was high, suggesting higher levels of vigilance. This study illustrates the diversity of behavioural adjustments to the risk of encountering a predator and how prey respond differently to temporal variations in this risk."

The usual method was for the male, with the female in tandem, to land on a stem of the Bogbean Menyanthes trifoliata and then, with both grasping the stem, the female to start laying eggs in the stem, progressing downwards until her abdomen was about half submerged, while always holding her wings clear of the surface. On one occasion a female grasped a leaf with the abdomen three quarters submerged and the wing tips immersed. On 1 July the female of a pair became completely submerged. In all cases the male remained in the sentinel position while contact guarding the female."

Recent developments, including new wide-angle lenses, advanced cameras, IP networks and video analysis technology, provide significant improvements in system performance and flexibility.This paper presents a new advanced surveillance system featuring a panoramic Panomorph lens for event detection, recognition and identification over a 360-degree area with 100% coverage. This innovative approach provides enhanced performance with better pixel/cost ratio. Intelligent video technology enables the video camera to be more than just a video camera; it allows the panoramic image to follow events (such as moving objects or unauthorized behavior) in real time, which in turn allows the operator to focus his/her activity on a narrow field pan/tilt camera without losing any information in the field.Adding incremental capabilities such as a Panomorph lens-based imager to an existing surveillance video system can provide improvements in operational efficiency and effectiveness. Foreseen applications are in the fields of border surveillance, high-security environments, aerospace and defense, mass transit, public security and wherever the need for total awareness is a prerequisite."

They are one of the first fish organs to be exposed to heavy metals in the aquatic environment. The exposure of Oreochromis mossambicus to copper showed deleterious effects to normal fish behaviours and varying degrees of gill damage when visualized under inverted light microscopy (stained with haematoxylin-eosin), scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Abnormalities of the nucleus shape, swollen cells, lipid droplet deposition, and an increase in vacuolation on the affected gills were observed with the degree of damage associated with CuSO4 exposure concentration. CuSO4 exposure in O. mossambicus also gave various patterns of inhibitory effects on cholinesterase (ChE) depending on the concentration of exposure and the organs exposed. Copper exposure altered ChE activity extracted from the gills of O. mossambicus with 99.9% of inhibition at the highest exposure concentration of CuSO4 (20mg/L). Hence, this study suggests the potential of this fish to become a sentinel species that permits the detection of lower copper contamination levels."

Direct observation suggested that males could not overcome female resistance; b. Females allowed repeated EPC attempts from the same male when they could have departed; c. No EPC attempts of post-egg-laying females were successful, but many were successful before laying, suggesting that females permitted insemination only when they could benefit from it; d. Males sometimes ceased attempting EPCs with females who persistently demonstrated unwillingness to copulate; e. Female behaviour has raised the possibility that sperm may be expelled. Two additional lines of evidence are deduced from a comparison of razorbill data with published accounts of the closely related common guillemot Uria aalge, in which forced EPCs are reported to occur regularly; (f) Male guillemots guard their mates with much greater vigilance than male razorbills, and (g) Male guillemots attempt EPCs by disrupting within-pair copulations and trying to force the pair female, while male razorbills decline such opportunities. The ability of females to control EPCs is important because it enables them to pursue a mixed reproductive strategy without suffering the costs of unwanted inseminations."
"LIMA, SL","ENERGY, PREDATORS AND THE BEHAVIOR OF FEEDING HUMMINGBIRDS",EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,5,220,230,10.1007/BF02214229,1991,"Current evidence suggests that many animals trade off energy gain against the risk of predation while feeding. In contrast, energetic considerations alone have proven successful in explaining and predicting the behaviour of feeding hummingbirds. This success may reflect the relative lack of natural predation on hummingbirds, but this study suggests that it may additionally reflect the lack of studies taking a predation perspective. In particular, when Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte anna) are faced with an obstructed view of their surroundings, they engage in behaviour suggestive of anti-predatory vigilance. In doing so, they voluntarily reduce their rate of energy intake. These birds also forgo better feeding opportunities that occur close to the ground, where observations suggest they are wary of opportunistic predators such as roadrunners (Geococcys californianus). While energy-based concepts will remain useful in the study of hummingbird feeding behaviour, the lack of predation on these birds should be equated with an insensitivity to the risk of predation. This realization may lead to further insights into hummingbird-plant interactions, and hummingbird biology in general."

Hen Sichuan Partridges led the chicks back to the nests where they hatched in the evening and roosted there over night. This behavior lasted 6.7 +/- 4.3 nights (range = 1-15; n = 13) after the chicks hatched. At this stage, the hens became very vigilant to predators and human disturbance. If disturbed, they often abandoned the nests immediately and no longer returned thereafter. The ambient temperature at night during the early brooding period of Sichuan Partridge at our study site was similar to 12.4 degrees C. Our findings suggest that hen Sichuan Partridges may make trade-offs between nest predation risks versus the thermoregulatory needs of their young."

Ail automated system for facial behavior recognition is always desirable. However, it is a challenging task due to the richness and ambiguity in daily facial behaviors. This paper presents an efficient approach to real-world facial behavior recognition. With dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) technology and a general-purpose facial behavior description language (e.g., FACS), a task oriented framework is constructed to systematically represent facial behaviors of interest and the associated visual observations. Based oil the task oriented DBN, we can integrate analysis results from previous times and prior knowledge of the application domain both spatially and temporally. With the top-down inference, the system can make dynamic and active selection among Multiple visual channels. With the bottom-up inference from observed evidences, the Current facial behavior call be classified with a desired confidence via belief propagation. We demonstrate the proposed task-oriented framework for monitoring driver vigilance. Experimental results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Several potential benefits are offered by such swards, including increases in prey availability (flush of foliar prey, reduced physical obstruction to surface and soil prey) and a foraging environment with fewer visual obstructions, so allowing predators to be detected more easily. We performed a field experiment using captive Common Starlings Sturnus vulgaris foraging in bottomless enclosures on newly mown swards (within 1 h) and old mown swards (48 h). We performed the experiment during winter months and standardized sward height to exclude other confounding effects in order to determine the temporal benefits of mowing for species foraging on soil invertebrates. We found no differences in the vigilance or time budgets of Starlings foraging on newly or old mown swards. Intake efficiency (prey captured per 100 roots) was greater on newly mown swards, suggesting that Starlings used less energy to obtain their prey on that substrate. It is possible that mowing alters the microclimate of the soil and sward, causing invertebrate availability to decline over time, which causes the lower foraging efficiency. Mowing is a technique often used to manipulate grassland habitats in ecological research; it has recently been advocated as a conservation management tool for wintering bird populations. We suggest that care should be taken when designing such studies to avoid confounding the factors under investigation with temporal changes in prey availability."

Both create problems that bring couples to therapy. Diagnosing jealousy as pathological versus normal turns out to be difficult, in part because infidelity has evolved to be concealed from the betrayed mate, which creates a signal detection problem. Because missing an infidelity committed by a mate has been more costly in evolutionary currencies than falsely suspecting a partner of cheating, selection has created an error management cognitive bias to over-infer a partner's betrayal. Moreover, adaptations for jealousy become activated by predictors of infidelity, such as mate value discrepancies, when no actual infidelities have occurred. Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) offers several ways to deal with these complexities. One way is to highlight potential mismatches, distinguishing between jealous emotions that were functional in ancestral environments but are less so in modern environments. A second is to distinguish between the goal of personal well-being and reproductive outcomes. Understanding the evolutionary logic of jealousy, in short, provides patients with conceptual tools for cognitively reframing jealousy and infidelity."

We conducted controlled choice experiments in the lab to determine whether green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) tadpoles are directly attracted to conspecifics (social factors) in the absence of environmental cues. Using repeated measures, we found that individual tadpoles strongly preferred associating with conspecifics compared to being alone. Furthermore, this preference was body size dependent, and associating tadpoles were significantly smaller than non-associating tadpoles. We suggest that small tadpoles are more vulnerable to predation and therefore more likely to form aggregations as an anti-predator behaviour. We demonstrate that tadpoles present an ideal model system for investigating how social and ecological factors influence group formation in vertebrates."

Women (n = 401) reported their personality traits, the frequency with which they performed mate retention behaviors during the past month, and their interest in and the time they spent performing fellatio on their partner during their most recent sexual encounter.

Women higher in psychopathy reported higher levels of verbal insults associated with derogating physical attractiveness, derogating value as a partner, accusations of sexual infidelity, and general cost-inflicting mate retention behaviors inflicted by their partners. Women higher in psychopathy and who also reported a higher desire for marriage were subjected to more cost-inflicting mate retention behaviors than women higher in psychopathy that reported a lower desire for marriage. In this context, mate retention behaviors may reduce the likelihood of infidelity by decreasing the self-worth of women higher on the Dark Triad traits so that they conclude they are unable to compete successfully for other partners."

The antipredator effect of the hissing call of Paridae has only been confirmed in several studies. To identify whether the hissing call of Japanese tits (Parus minor) affects the feeding behavior of the nest predator Swinhoe's striped squirrel (Tamiops swinhoei), we played back white noise, the call of Oriental turtle doves (Streptopelia orientalis), and the hissing call of Japanese tits to squirrels. The squirrels responded differently to the three types of sounds played back. The proportion of squirrels that still fed while the hissing call of tits being played (26.1%) was significantly lower than that when white noise (91.3%) and the call of doves (85.7%) being played. The alert time of feeding squirrels to the hissing call of tits was also significantly longer than that to white noise and the call of doves. Our study suggests that the hissing call of tits can change the feeding behavior of the nest predator squirrel, which may reduce nest predation in cavity birds."

A person center approach was used to analyze individual moral identity. It indicated three clusters of moral identity: self-transcendence, mixed, and self-enhancement. It was found that only the self transcendence (benevolence-care and universalism-concern) cluster positively predicted environmental involvement. In Study II, we used a narrative approach to assess moral motivations in a group of environmental activists and environmental non-activists. The results revealed three motivations of participants whom scored high in environmental involvement: 1) Concern for other species; 2) Vigilance for the environment; 3) Personal disgust towards environmentally irresponsible others. In contrast, we identified two overarching themes of self-interest and apathy among participants who scored low in the environmental involvement.

Two main sources of imprecision were identified: failure to correctly categorize birds (in or out of the transect area, passing or following the ship) and failure to detect birds. Incorrect categorization could be avoided by adequate training. Biases caused by specific differences in detectability could be reduced by increasing vigilance and by making use of the best possible vantage. Calculation of values of observer precision permits an estimate of the reliability with which different species are detected."

In the current research, we used k-means cluster analysis to identify distinct strategies of mate retention behaviors. Participants were 637 individuals (56.3% male) in a romantic relationship with an opposite-sex individual for at least 3 months (M = 78.7; SD = 95.8) and aged between 18 and 70 years (M = 29.3, SD = 10.5). Participants completed the Mate Retention Inventory-Short Form. The results suggested three distinct mate retention clusters or strategies: (1) Disengaged (infrequent use of both benefit-provisioning and cost-inflicting behaviors), (2) Exhaustive (frequent use of both benefit-provisioning and cost-inflicting behaviors), and (3) Benevolent (frequent use of benefit-provisioning and infrequent use of cost-inflicting behaviors). The results also indicated, for example, that men more than women use a benevolent strategy, women more than men use a disengaged strategy, and men using an exhaustive strategy report being less physically intimate with their partners than men using a benevolent strategy. We discuss the results with reference to evolutionary hypotheses of mate retention, and we highlight limitations of the current research and important directions for future research."

In a field study, we used a sentinel prey approach to investigate whether this trait might serve as an aposematic function in chemically defended fireflies. We also examined and provide the first detailed description of green and red patterns of blue light-induced fluorescence in the adults and larvae of Ellychnia corrusca (L.) (Coleoptera: Lampyridae). We placed artificial prey models with and without fluorescent markings in a forested area of Belmont, Massachusetts, USA, where they were exposed to natural predators. Clay models were styled to resemble Photinus fireflies, the most common firefly genus in this area, and a close relative of Ellychnia. The field study was conducted from Oct through May in Belmont, Massachusetts; this is the period when adults of the diurnal non-luminescent firefly E. corrusca are overwintering on trees. We observed considerable seasonal variation in attack rates, and marks on the clay models indicated they were attacked by avian, mammal, and arthropod predators. However, no difference was seen between fluorescent and non-fluorescent models in predator attack rates. This suggests that fireflies' fluorescent markings do not serve as an aposematic signal, at least for the predator guild active in New England woodlands."

We used hair dye to dull epaulets of free-living territorial males prior to pair formation to determine if manipulated males experienced disadvantages in comparison with control males. We found no differences between control males and males with dulled epaulets in territorial behavior (territory size, song rate, trespass rate, and loss of territory), paternal care (time spent on territory and in antipredator sentinel behavior, and response to a model crow to simulate the threat of predation), pairing success (number of social mates), apparent reproductive success (numbers of nesting attempts, eggs/nest, nestlings/egg, and fledglings/nestling), or realized reproductive success (numbers of within-pair, extra-pair, and total fledglings as determined by DNA fingerprinting). We then used a meta-analysis of 11 published studies of Red-winged Blackbirds to determine if there is an overall effect of epaulet color or size on male-male competition, female choice, or reproductive success. Our results show that epaulet size has a small positive effect on male reproductive success, but epaulet color has no effect on male-male competition, female choice, and male reproductive success. One explanation for the seeming contradiction between studies that show that epaulets are necessary for territory defense and those that conclude that epaulets are not currently under selection is that epaulets serve as one of several cues of species recognition, especially among males at close range. An alternative explanation proposes counter-balancing intersexual advantages and intrasexual disadvantages of epaulet expression. Additional studies are needed to test these alternatives."

In addition, during the survey process, 20 behaviors were described with the duration time for each behavior recorded and analyzed. 12 greylag geese were observed and the observation happened 8:00 to 16:00 every day in the experiment. Results showed that the longest duration time for each behavior differed with the longest duration time of rest being 20 min; whereas, communication behavior was only 16 s. The shortest duration time for each behavior was almost the same lasting from 3 to 10 s, but there were fluctuations for all behaviors. Greylag goose behavioral rhythm during overwintering indicated that feeding, being stationary, exercising, and cleaning were the major behaviors. The proportion of time for being stationary was more than the others with peaks always occurring in the morning and evening. Frequency of the foraging behavior was determined by feeding with two peaks in a day. During the foraging process, many behaviors were observed, such as the vigilance behavior. This research would be useful for rearing and succoring greylag geese that were over wintering."

The first prediction, that males would be more likely to successfully copulate while carrying infants than while not carrying infants, was not supported in either species. In common marmosets, males were less likely to copulate while carrying infants. This relation may reflect the lower activity levels and increased vigilance required by those individuals transporting infants. The second prediction, that the overall percentage of time that males spent carrying infants would be related to overall frequency of copulations during fertile periods, was also not supported for either species. The third prediction was that, if females selected mates relative to their infant-care 'performance', males should be more solicitous of the breeding female's efforts to relinquish the infant to another carrier than to the efforts of other group members. If so, then males should retrieve harassed infants from mothers more frequently than from other group members; this prediction was not supported. The results of this study offer no support for the contention that infant care serves as a form of courtship in callitrichid primates. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Vegetation height and density and arthropod abundance from mapped foraging sites were compared with control sites. Prey items fed to nestlings were quantified and compared with their relative abundance.Results Meadow Pipits selected foraging sites with significantly lower vegetation height and density, but with significantly higher arthropod biomass. Our data suggest that within foraging sites, Meadow Pipits select particular prey types to provision nestlings, in particular, Lepidoptera larvae, adult Tipulidae and Arachnida.Conclusions In intensively grazed upland systems, it appears that Meadow Pipits select foraging sites that optimize total food abundance and accessibility. In order to understand how anticipated changes to livestock farming in Europe will affect grassland birds, we recommend that future studies should investigate the foraging and vigilance behaviour, diet composition and breeding success of a variety of bird species provisioning nestlings under a range of livestock management scenarios."

Arthropods were most abundant in the upper parts of the canopy and on the surface of ground vegetation. Sparrowhawks were seen attacking parids only in the upper parts of the canopy. The lowest parts of the pines were safer and this was confirmed by the anti-predatory vigilance of the birds. Crested Tits, top-ranking individuals in the mixed flocks, tended to be frequent ground feeders under snow-free conditions, which was not the case under snowy conditions suggesting the importance of snow cover. Although the lowest parts of trees was the poorest site in terms of arthropod abundance, dominant individuals of the Crested Tit remained there under snowy conditions. Foraging height of alpha individuals of the Willow Tit did not differ from one climate condition to the other. Subordinate Willow and Crested Tits, by contrast, significantly increased their foraging heights. Although subordinate Willow Tits foraged in the highest canopy parts, however, their survival rates did not differ from those of higher-ranked Willow Tits. The results suggest that foraging in the most vulnerable tree parts may not be always linked to the decreased survival. The observed shift of subordinate Willow Tits supposedly made their anti-predatory vigilance more effective, suggesting a possible trade-off between concealment and visibility."

These trophic cascades are driven not only by the number of animals they kill, but also by how prey alter their behaviors to reduce risk. The different levels of risk navigated by prey has been likened to a landscape of fear. In Australia, dingoes are known to suppress red fox populations, driving a trophic cascade. However, most of what we know of this relationship comes from circumstances where predators are persecuted, which can affect their social and trophic interactions. Utilizing camera traps, we monitored fox behavior when accessing key resource points used by territorial dingoes, in a region where both predators are protected. We predicted that foxes would avoid and be more cautious in areas of high dingo activity. Indeed, foxes avoided directly encountering dingoes. However, contrary to our expectations, foxes were not more cautious or vigilant where dingo activity was high. In fact, fox activity and scent-marking rates increased where dingo scent-marking was concentrated. Further, foxes were increasingly confident with increasing levels of conspecific activity. Our results suggest that responses to the threat of predation are more complex than fear alone. In socially stable conditions, it is possible that prey may develop knowledge of their predators, facilitating avoidance, and reducing fear."

In species of conservation concern identifying nest predators is an important first step in developing management strategies to mitigate low nesting success caused by depredation. Because predator composition varies geographically and with landscape factors habitat restoration may need to be tailored to reduce locally important predators. We used miniature video cameras to identify nest predators in a population of Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) significant to conservation. At 22 nests we observed 25 predation events; 22 (88%) of these events were nocturnal. Yellow rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta) had the highest daily predation rate and accounted for 76% of egg and nestling losses. Florida Scrub-Jays are vulnerable to nocturnal nest predation because their vigilance behavior is ineffective against nocturnal predators, breeders cannot defend against nocturnal predators, and brooding females are at risk of being killed by nocturnal predators. If current habitat restoration efforts do not reduce numbers of yellow rat snakes and improve scrub-jay nesting success, management actions to reduce populations of nocturnal snakes may need to be considered."

Therefore, the development of intelligent driver assistance systems, which provides automatic monitoring of driver's vigilance, is an urgent and challenging task. This paper presents a novel system for video-based driving behavior recognition. The fundamental idea is to monitor driver's hand movements and to use these as predictors for safe/unsafe driving behavior. In comparison to previous work, the proposed method utilizes hierarchical classification and treats driving behavior in terms of a spatio-temporal reference framework as opposed to a static image. The approach was verified using the Southeast University Driving-Posture Dataset, a dataset comprised of video clips covering aspects of driving such as: normal driving, responding to a cell phone call, eating and smoking. After pre-processing for illumination variations and motion sequence segmentation, eight classes of behavior were identified. The overall prediction accuracy obtained using the proposed approach was 89: 62% when using a hierarchical classification approach. The proposed approach was able to clearly identify two dangerous driving behaviors, Responding to a cellphone call and Eating, with recognition rates of 92.39% and 92.29% respectively."

A sample of nonparous females was obtained by administering a short-term chemosterilant at the time of breeding. Relative to nonparous females, parous females spent more time above ground, more time foraging, and less time vigilant, particularly during lactation, and had a longer active season. Thus, in absolute terms, parous females spent more time exposed to aboveground predators than did nonparous females. Parous females spent less time at burrow entrances and, during lactation, were active farther from escape burrows than were nonparous females. Parous and nonparous females did not differ in the percentage of time spent vigilant during foraging bouts. These results indicate that females respond to the energetic demands of reproduction by increasing the absolute amount of time spent foraging, which entails an acceptance of an increase in exposure to predators, and not by modifying their behaviour during foraging bouts."

Intermediary factors that explain how context (seasonal or regional characteristics of the ecological community) affects these interactions are rarely reported. We compared activity time and density in vicunas (Vicugna vicugna) introduced into the Chimborazo Faunal Production Reserve (CFPR), Ecuador, to describe how they interact with livestock. We compared vicuna density in wetlands and uplands (two landscape structures) with and without livestock (two conditions) using an isodar approach. We measured, over two seasons, vicuna forage abundance, composition, preference and accessibility, time vicunas spent vigilant, and their flight distances on approach. We tested optimal foraging theory relating to the hypothesis that time mediates behavior, and found that vicunas were no less frequently vigilant, nor were flight distances greater, during a wet season or in habitats of greater forage abundance and accessibility. We also found no evidence that vicuna behavior was density dependent; instead, we found that more time was spent vigilant by vicunas when they foraged near livestock in rainy regions during the dry season. Although forage abundance was similar throughout CFPR during a dry season, better forage quality in areas occupied by livestock may constitute an effect of their facilitating vicunas. A puzzling finding, because it was not explained by any of the other variables we measured, was that at low densities vicunas selected habitat irrespective of livestock, and where their density was higher, it was doubly so adjacent to livestock. We conclude that in the CFPR, spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality determines the interactions between livestock and vicunas. To support recommendations that minimize competition between wildlife and livestock, and to expand on descriptions of the contexts that determine the direction of species interactions, future study may require a wider sampling of the densities of sympatric large herbivores in general, and, in the CFPR, a closer resolution of spatial heterogeneity in forage plant quality."

Accelerometer data used in conjunction with machine learning algorithms have been the tool of choice for characterising animal behaviour. Although machine learning models perform reasonably well, they may not rely on meaningful features, nor lend themselves to physical interpretation of the classification rules. This lack of interpretability and control over classification outcomes is of particular concern where different behaviours have different frequency of occurrence and duration, as in most natural systems, and calls for the development of alternative methods. Biomechanical approaches to human activity classification could overcome these shortcomings, yet their full potential remains untapped for animal studies. We propose a general framework for behaviour recognition using accelerometers, and develop a hybrid model where (a) biomechanical features characterise movement dynamics, and (b) a node-based hierarchical classification scheme employs simple machine learning algorithms at each node to find feature-value thresholds separating different behaviours. Using triaxial accelerometer data collected on 10 wild Kalahari meerkats, and annotated video recordings of each individual as groundtruth, this hybrid model was validated in three scenarios: (a) when each behaviour was equally represented (EQDIST), (b) when naturally imbalanced datasets were considered (STRAT) and (c) when data from new individuals were considered (LOIO). A linear-kernel Support Vector Machine at each node of our classification scheme yielded an overall accuracy of >95% for each scenario. Our hybrid approach had a 2.7% better average overall accuracy than top-performing classical machine learning approaches. Further, we showed that not all models with high overall accuracy returned accurate behaviour-specific performance, and good performance during EQDIST did not always generalise to STRAT and LOIO. Our hybrid model took advantage of robust machine learning algorithms for automatically estimating decision boundaries between behavioural classes. This not only achieved high classification performance but also permitted biomechanical interpretation of classification outcomes. The framework presented here provides the flexibility to adapt models to required levels of behavioural resolution, and has the potential to facilitate meaningful model sharing between studies."

Chimpanzee facial displays have typically been described as highly graded communicative signals, but we propose an additional distinction: blended displays. They appear to be morphologically and acoustically similar to the expressions in greater than or equal to 2 prototypical/parent categories. We describe the facial and vocal communicative repertoire of chimpanzees and examine how they use graded and blended signals in different social contexts. Data from behavioral observations revealed that they used facial displays differently depending on the social context. Specifically, the variability can be explained by 7 factors representing nervousness and distress, agonism, contact reassurance, excitement, greetings, play, and vigilance. Additionally, the use of blended displays was not simply divided between the contexts that elicited the parent types, nor were they used in totally unique contexts. Instead, the data showed that the contextual use of blended displays is primarily correlated with the social contexts that elicited only one of the parent expressions. Thus, the blended displays appeared to reflect conflicting internal motivational states in the sender, instead of expressing features of the external environment. We proffer several possible explanations for how the blended signals may be interpreted by receivers and why they would be contextually associated with only one parent group."
"Wilson, Alexander D. M.; Kelly, Clint D.",Do alternative reproductive strategies in the Wellington tree weta represent different behavioural types?,ETHOLOGY,125,380,391,10.1111/eth.12862,2019,"In many animal species, variation in reproductive success among individuals has led to the evolution of alternative mating strategies, which in the case of insects can often be correlated with developmental trajectories. In the Wellington tree weta, Hemideina crassidens, males can mature at the 8th, 9th or 10th instar, while females mature at the 10th instar only. A number of morphological attributes including male head and mandible size correlate with final instar number, and as these attributes represent a form of weaponry, they are often used in mate/site guarding and male-male competition. Tenth instar males have larger head/mandible/body sizes and show a conventional (guarder) reproductive strategy, whereas smaller 8th instar males typically show an unconventional (sneaker) strategy. In contrast, 9th instar males are predicted to adopt a jack-of-all-trades strategy whereby they can fight or sneak depending context. Here, we tested whether alternative reproductive morphs exhibit strategy-specific differences in risk-taking associated with refuge emergence, activity and antipredator behaviour and further, whether these traits correlate to form a behavioural syndrome. We found that tree weta show consistent and repeatable differences in activity and refuge use at the individual level; however, behavioural covariances suggest that only 8th instar males exhibit a behavioural syndrome. That 9th instar males show high plasticity and variance in their gallery-related behaviours supports the hypothesis that these males are a jack-of-all-trades. Contrary to our predictions, antipredator behaviour was not correlated with other traits, and differences in behaviour overall were consistently more pronounced between individuals rather than between male morphs or sexes."

Here, we explored behavioural responses to the presence of a predator in wild populations of the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae that typically breed in permanent (e.g., rice field paddies) and temporary (e.g., road ruts) water collections. Methods: Larvae used in these experiments were obtained from eggs laid by wild female An. gambiae collected from two localities in south-western Burkina Faso during the 2008 rainy season. Single larvae were observed in an experimental arena, and behavioural traits were recorded and quantified a) in the absence of a predator and b) in the presence of a widespread mosquito predator, the backswimmer Anisops jaczewskii. Differences in the proportion of time allocated to each behaviour were assessed using Principal Component Analysis and Multivariate Analysis of Variance. Results: The behaviour of M and S form larvae was found to differ significantly; although both forms mainly foraged at the water surface, spending 60-90% of their time filtering water at the surface or along the wall of the container, M form larvae spent on average significantly more time browsing at the bottom of the container than S form larvae (4.5 vs. 1.3% of their overall time, respectively; P < 0.05). In the presence of a predator, larvae of both forms modified their behaviour, spending significantly more time resting along the container wall (P < 0.001). This change in behaviour was at least twice as great in the M form (from 38.6 to 66.6% of the time at the wall in the absence and presence of the predator, respectively) than in the S form (from 48.3 to 64.1%). Thrashing at the water surface exposed larvae to a significantly greater risk of predation by the notonectid (P < 0.01), whereas predation occurred significantly less often when larvae were at the container wall (P < 0.05) and might reflect predator vigilance. Conclusions: Behavioural differences between larvae of the M and S form of An. gambiae in response to an acute predation risk is likely to be a reflection of different trade-offs between foraging and predator vigilance that might be of adaptive value in contrasting aquatic ecosystems. Future studies should explore the relevance of these findings under the wide range of natural settings where both forms co-exist in Africa."

This study aimed at investigating the relative influence of three types of disturbances (mammalian herbivores, terrestrial threats from ground predators and aerial threats) on the responses by waterbirds at waterpans in Hwange National Park (HNP, Zimbabwe) and adjacent land uses. Thirteen waterpans were monitored during daylight hours between years 2015 and 2017 and responses of waterbirds to the three forms of disturbances were recorded. Logistic regressions revealed that the likelihood of responding was highest after terrestrial threats; with individuals/groups that were initially engaged in non-feeding activities that allowed vigilance, responding the most. Wildfowl species spent significantly longer time flying (compared to waders and generalists), more so in communal areas (CAs) than HNP, and after terrestrial threats compared to aerial threats and herbivore disturbances. We did not find any differences in probability of responding across land uses probably because there is less human disturbance in HNP, but predation risk is high. Further, even though there are less terrestrial predators in CAs, domestic dogs may be maintaining the stimuli. We conclude that terrestrial threats are least tolerated, with species most susceptible to human predation (i.e. wildfowl) losing more time avoiding them. Interestingly, only acute aerial threats induced departure from waterpans. Our findings have a direct implication for waterbird conservation as herbivore and human density in this area are currently increasing."

In many studies, the impact of human activities on wildlife is assessed through census counts, i.e. by estimating population sizes or densities, but also the social organisation of gregarious species can be affected. Using seven species of ungulates occurring in the Akagera Ecosystem, we compared grouping patterns (i.e. group sizes and compositions) of different group types (e.g. bachelor, all-female and mixed-sex groups) between sites situated inside a protected area, i.e. Lake Mburo National Park in Uganda and the adjacent Ankole Ranching Scheme (ARS), an unprotected area with intense human pursuit. Differences in group sizes were detectible in only a few cases, e.g. bachelor group size in common eland Tragelaphus oryx pattersonianus increased in the ARS, which may be advantageous due to increased vigilance. However, we found pronounced differences in group compositions in numerous species and for different group types, for example, in eland and waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa (i.e. in all group types), and topi Damaliscus lunatus jimela, oribi Ourebia ourebi and warthog Phacochoerus aetiopicus (all-female and mixed-sex groups). We discuss that continuous monitoring of grouping patterns of these (and other) species may be a valuable approach to detect 'subtle' effects of human nuisance even before an overall population decline can be observed."

Individual identified colour-ringed males sang with unchanged intensity throughout the breeding season. The period of daily singing activity differed from other species of Acrocephalus: males sang at dusk rather than at dawn. Males took no part in rearing nestlings but remained on territory and showed vigilance behaviour. The density of males in the breeding season ranged from 1.0 to 10.9 per 10 ha. The density of nesting females ranged from 1. 3 to 1 5.7 per 10 ha. In the most suitable habitat females were more numerous than males. The distribution of females (nests) was clumped where potential food resources were higher. Nests were well hidden in places with deeper water between sedge tufts and an abundance of old dry sedge. Females feeding nestlings collected most food within a 5-60-m radius (mean 31.7 m). The return rate of males was higher than that of females.

However, as well as switching between lateral and frontal viewing, the hens also swung their heads from side to side with movements so large that the same object appeared to be viewed with completely different parts of the retina, and even with different eyes, in rapid succession. When confronted with a novel object, the hens walked more slowly but continued to show large head movements. This suggests that, unlike mammals, which gaze fixedly at novel objects, hens investigate them by moving the head and looking at them with different, specialized, parts of their eyes. Many aspects of bird behaviour, such as search image formation, vigilance and visual discriminations, may be affected by the way they move the head and eyes.

Straight-line distances between daily consecutive radiolocations during holidays (0.74 km, SD = 1.1, n = 86) were twice those of workdays (0.38 km, SD = 0.31, n = 67). Further, 43 visual observations (summing to 1,943 minutes) of the family group showed greater investment in activities such as travel, fleeing, and vigilance on holidays (55% vs. 39% on workdays). Habitats used during holidays differed, as demonstrated by a significant increase of rocky outcrops (26%, SD = 23, workdays; and 38%, SD = 25, holidays) and higher distances to unpaved roads (0.35 km SD = 0.21, workdays; 0.45 km SD = 0.22, holidays). Although our sample size was limited to an adult female with cubs in the western Cantabrian Range in a population of only 50-65 bears, the results show that she seemed to avoid human presence and may have fostered similar behavior in her cubs."

Correlations between features surrounding a nest and breeding success at different stages of the breeding cycle are presented. Lesser Black-backed Gulls nested on more vegetated and flatter areas than did Herring Gulls, even though the latter species had a lower hatching success at less vegetated sites. The difference in the general topography of nest sites between the species suggests that the Lesser Black-backed Gull, through an individual defence strategy, may be better adapted to use sites which are accessible to ground predators than the Herring Gull. The fledging success of Lesser Black-backed Gulls tended to increase with an increased proportion of relatively tall vegetation close to the nest. The Lesser Black-backed Gull may therefore be able to leave its young unattended and rely on their concealment for protection against predators. In contrast, the Herring Gull may rely more on parental vigilance to protect young. More frequent attendance by adult Herring Gulls at the nest site during chick rearing compared with lesser Black-backed Gulls supports this hypothesis."

Females oviposited into the Hornwort with only a part of their abdomens submerged. Similar behaviour was also observed by pairs perched on other plants, including Bog Bean Menyanthes trifoliata. On 11 May a pair was observed when the female submerged completely for just over a minute. On 23 May a pair was seen with the female already completely submerged and the male followed. At the same time a second pair was also observed nearby with both sexes submerged. To the best of my knowledge this is the first report of complete male submergence in this species."

Eagles were widespread and their increase through fall and winter coincided with migratory movements of waterbirds. Many species of waterbird used inshore waters in early fall when eagles were scarce. Diving birds moved away from inshore waters when eagles returned in late fall and winter, whereas dabbling ducks formed large flocks in inshore waters and spent proportionally more time being vigilant as winter progressed. Flock sizes and avoidance flight distances of scoters and dabblers, but not gulls, increased with proximity to eagles. Waterbirds did not alter vigilance with distance to eagles. We discuss our findings in context of management issues regarding apparent declines and importance of understanding indirect effects of predators on prey for wildlife monitoring."

A target's traits can be differentiated into the Big Two fundamental content dimensions of agency and communion. Four studies test the hypothesis that relative to agentic traits communal traits - which can also be conceptualized as other-profitable traits - are processed preferentially because they convey more information relevant for approach vs. avoidance decisions. Across four studies, we found consistent support for this preferential processing hypothesis. Communal trait words were recognized faster (Study 1) and categorized faster with regard to valence than agentic trait words (Study 2); communal traits were inferred faster from behavior descriptions than agentic traits (Study 3); and finally, communal traits were mentioned prior to agentic ones in spontaneous descriptions of another person (Study 4). Throughout these studies the stimuli's valence (positive or negative words or behaviors) did not moderate this processing speed advantage of communal information. Participants' responses in Study 4, however, were more valence-driven for the communion dimension than for the agency dimension. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

A factor analytical study of individual differences in modes of energy discharge resulting from experimentally-induced frustration,U S NAVAL MED RES LAB REPT,21,1,29,,1962,"Forty submariner volunteers were exposed to two stress-inducing situations,[long dash]a pacing task, and a discrimination conflict task. Changes in electrodermal conductance (EDC) in response to stress, and recover-ability following stress, were accepted as measures of internal energy mobilization and re-equilibration. At the same time, change in hand tremor during the pacing experiment was used as a measure of external energy mobilization. Discrimination time in the conflict experiment, simple reaction time, respiration rate, scores from a neurotic symptom inventory, and peer ratings with respect to five personality traits, were also included in the 29 variable matrix. Factor analysis of the matrix resulted in five factors labeled, for the purpose of discussion: optimal somatopsychological adjustment; reduced excitation level; re-duced vigilance; high excitation level and external energy mobilization. Favorable adjustment to stress of the kind induced in this experiment appears to be related to high internal mobilization (increase in EDC), and by absence of evidence of external change (hand tremor). Some initial steps in the construction of a theoretical model described in the language of behavioral energetics are also presented in this report. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author"

Some of these behaviors entice a partner's continued investment through the provision of benefits, while others inflict costs for defection. These cost-inflicting behaviors, while potentially valuable, are also risky, as they may ultimately increase the odds of a romantic partner's defection or retaliation. Given the riskiness of cost-inflicting behaviors, we hypothesize that men's use of these behaviors can be predicted by men's tendency toward risk-taking behavior more generally, but only when that risk-taking is indicative of lower mate value or relationship investment. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether and how performance of behaviors within five risk-taking domains (ethical, financial, recreational, health/safety, and social) predict men's use of cost-inflicting behaviors. Using path analysis and data from partner-reports from 122 female undergraduate students in a committed, heterosexual, sexual relationship, we confirmed that men's performance of cost-inflicting behavior is predicted by men's unethical risky behavior and, to a lesser extent, financial and recreational risky behavior."

These incongruent attentional biases in the processing of positive and negative outcomes of risky options can explain why people tend to avoid risky options in a gain frame but tend to choose risky options in a loss frame. In line with our expectations, Experiment 1 revealed incongruent effects of framing on attentional biases for positive vs. negative stimuli in an evaluation task. In addition, valence bias predicted risk-seeking vs. risk-averse decisions and mediated the effect of framing on decision making. Two additional experiments investigated effects of valence biases on risky decision making by manipulating affective processing directly with an attention training task. Inducing a positivity (negativity) bias produced risk-seeking (risk-averse) decision behavior by enhancing the salience of win- or loss-related information in a gambling task with ambivalent color stimuli (Experiment 2) and by enhancing the impact of gain or loss outcomes on decision making in a coin toss (Experiment 3).

The results clearly indicate that type and frequency of the disturbance have a strong influence on the behavioural response and that the disturbance tolerance varies with season, time of the day, sex and group size. Disturbances from flying resulted in a much stronger response than disturbances from the ground, and the response increased with velocity and/or noise level of the disturbance source. In areas with frequent disturbances the behavioural response was reduced when compared with remote areas, indicating habituation effects. While distance at first reaction and flight distance varied with disturbance intensity, the length of the flight path was not influenced by the disturbance type and frequency. Habitat use was also affected by disturbances: post-disturbance habitat types were mainly rocks and forests indicating a shift in habitat selection towards inaccessible habitat types or habitat types with good cover."

Cost-Inflicting mate retention behaviors (e.g., inducing a partner's jealousy) are riskier than Benefit-Provisioning mate retention behaviors (e.g., showing love and care for a partner), because the former increase the odds of a partner's defection or retaliation. Individual differences in endorsement of Existence values-i.e., valuing Personal Stability, Health, and Survival may be associated with the type of mate retention behaviors people perform. We hypothesized that individuals who endorse Existence values more (versus less), would perform less frequent Cost-Inflicting mate retention behaviors (controlling for performance of Benefit-Provisioning mate retention behaviors; Hypothesis 1), and more frequent Benefit-Provisioning mate retention behaviors (controlling for performance of Cost-Inflicting mate retention behaviors; Hypothesis 2). Participants (n = 164), each in a heterosexual, romantic relationship of at least three months duration, completed a survey that included the Mate Retention Inventory Short Form and the Basic Values Survey. Endorsement of Existence values was negatively associated with performance of Cost-Inflicting mate retention behaviors (supporting Hypothesis 1), and positively associated with performance of Benefit-Provisioning mate retention behaviors (supporting Hypothesis 2). We situate these results within an evolutionary framework on mate retention, and discuss their theoretical and applied utility. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Wing-moulting Greylag Geese Anser anser feeding in a Danish saltmarsh were no exception to this pattern as none fed more than 175 m from the sea. An individual-based stochastic model of goose feeding distribution derived from empirical data showed that requirements for drinking water could not explain the coastal feeding distribution as the model predicted that 57% of all goose observations would be more than 175 m from the sea. The availability of Common Saltmarsh Grass Puccinellia maritima , the preferred food item, could partly explain the exploitation pattern of geese but not the absence of geese from inland feeding areas. Furthermore, the results did not support the hypothesis that geese actively avoided inland feeding areas because of elevated costs from vigilance. The frequency of anti-predator displacement to the sea was the most likely explanation of the feeding pattern. A model that included such displacements predicted that 99% of all geese would feed less than 175 m from the sea. As anti-predator displacement put the most severe constraints on the feeding distribution, predation risk and level of disturbance were suggested to be the overall factors, which determine the choice of moult site in wing-moulting geese."

When provided with extra food, juveniles, but not adults, improved their winter survival significantly. Because of lessened energy stress, juveniles spent less time foraging and more scanning for predators. They also avoided the dominating adults and foraged more in less predator-risky microhabitats. The generally lower winter survival of juvenile relative to adult Willow Tits is suggested to be partly an effect of adult dominance."

The current study is the first to implement a dyadic perspective to explore interpersonal effects of personality traits on mate retention. We investigated actor and partner effects of the five-factor personality traits on mate retention using actor-partner interdependence modeling with data secured from both members of 190 hetero-sexual romantic couples. In a round-robin design, each participant rated their own and their partner's personality traits, and their own mate retention behaviors. Our results demonstrated the largest actor and partner effects of neuroticism on mate retention, particularly on cost-inflicting behaviors, showing that individuals higher on neuroticism reported their more frequent use. Smaller and opposite effects of agreeableness and conscientiousness were found, with higher levels of these traits related to less frequent use of cost-inflicting behaviors. Several effects of these Big Three personality traits generalized across self- and partner-reports, indicating that they were not the artifacts of common method variance. The effects of openness were much weaker and none generalized across both data sources. Extraversion did not demonstrate any significant effects.

This tendency is evident in individual experience, organizational behavior, and denialist discourses. Research has been hampered by conceptualizing this defensiveness in terms of unconscious defense mechanisms or underlying cognitive processes. In contrast, I conceptualize defensiveness in terms of observable defensive tactics, namely, the actions and utterances that are used to resist disruptive meanings. I introduce the analogy of the semantic immune system to conceptualize three layers of defensive tactics: avoiding, delegitimizing, and limiting the impact of disruptive meanings. Defensive tactics are cultural-historical creations that, like the immune system, have adapted over time to neutralize disruptive meanings. I use this tripartite conceptualization to review the fragmented literature on defensive tactics. The observability of these tactics gives centrality to the audience who either calls out or does not call out the use of defensive tactics-questioning or implicitly supporting the legitimacy of the defended views. The vigilance of the audience pushes the tactics toward increasingly subtle forms that seek to pass undetected. Reconceptualizing defensiveness in terms of observable tactics reveals the importance of the audience and opens these tactics up to empirical research, calling upon researchers to identify the increasingly subtle ways in which learning through dialogue is inhibited."

In some circumstances, birds use the same site during both daylight hours and during the night. This study was conducted on a small (< 1 ha) pond used by Teal (Anas crecca) by day and by night in the early part of the winter. Duck numbers were not related either to the abundance of food resources, water levels or pond area. Teal had the same pattern of behaviour during daylight and at night, foraging being the main activity through the whole period of their presence on the site. Comfort activities decreased with increasing water levels and pond area, perhaps because the predation risk is greater in these conditions. This study contributes to understanding the factors affecting the use of diurnal feeding sites by Teal."

Vegetable agroforestry can combine perennial woody crops and non-woody crops, which may alter ground predator activity-density and predation potential. We used living sentinel prey (Cydia pomonella) to assess predation in two different months, as a function of three levels of canopy openness in an agroforestry system combining lettuce crops and grassy strips. Ground beetles and arachnids were sampled throughout the year and we analyzed summer data conjointly to assess potential differences in the activity-density of these major predators between treatments. We found significantly higher predation potential in June in all agroforestry treatments compared to the control. In August, however, no differences were observed. Ground beetles and Opiliones were the major predators involved in observed predation events at both sampling periods. Differences in predation potential in June (- 35% in the control compared to agroforestry treatments) could be due to differences in Pterostichus madidus and Opiliones activity-density, which may have increased due to warmer temperatures under trees compared to the control plot."

We propose a new hypothesis that this adaptation represents visual interspecies signalling to facilitate mixed-species herding. Mixed-species herds likely offer enhanced protection from predation. They can also facilitate feeding for both zebra and other grazers, as zebra are hindgut fermenters and prefer different foliage to associating ruminants. This mechanism, uniquely, can explain why stripes might evolve in zebra and not in other large African grazers (because of their different digestive strategy). This signalling mechanism is not exclusive, however, and could operate alongside one or more of the previously postulated mechanisms selecting for zebra stripes."

However, its use with younger children is problematical, because indices measuring attention indirectly (omissions, commissions, reaction time) may be distorted by difficulties in following instructions: the ability to maintain and manipulate instructions in working memory, and to inhibit inappropriate actions increases with age. In the present research, we adapted such a task for children between 2 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months, and recorded visual activity in order to measure directly visual attention and to relate it to performance. Even very young children spend most of the time looking at the screen, but they display poor performances and are unable to re-engage in the task after a gap (2 consecutive omissions). At a medium level (age 3 years 6 months to 4 years) endogenous control of attention increases, children come back to the task, off-task looks shorten and reach the short values observed in older children. After 4 years 6 months no more gaps are observed, the consistency of reaction times shows that a controlled strategy, including shifts from and to the screen, is now adopted. The discussion suggests that only at this upper level do indirect performance indices evaluate attention."

In contrast, with adults in coherent groups, they almost exclusively foraged in predator-exposed sites (high predation risk) of high quality trees (high food intake). In the latter case, more time could be allocated to foraging due to decreased vigilance by each individual (supplementary food intake).

Further, continuous relations between the two ADHD symptom domains and CPT performance and motor activity, and importantly, age effects in these relations were examined.

Billbugs are a major pest of turfgrass in the Intermountain West, but the composition of the local predatory arthropod community and whether predators aid in billbug suppression through consumptive or non-consumptive effects is unknown. First, we catalogued the predatory arthropod community on Utah and Idaho golf courses using linear pitfall traps. Then, we assessed adult billbug consumption by resident predators in the field. Using a series of lab assays, we assessed the most abundant predators' consumption of billbug life stages, including adults, sentinel waxworm larvae at varied soil depths, and eggs in turf stems. Finally, we assessed the non-consumptive effects of these abundant predators on adult billbug activity (mating, oviposition, thanatosis). We found that the predatory arthropod community consisted primarily of carabids (Pterostichus melanarius, Harpalus sp., Amara aenea, and Anisodactylus sp.) and spiders (lycosids), representing 60% and 28% of all predators, respectively. In the field and in lab assays, adult billbug mortality from predation was generally low at < 6%. While predators readily consumed sentinel larvae in petri dish arenas, larvae escaped predation at 1 cm soil depth. The greatest consumptive effects of predators were on billbug eggs, with Anisodactlylus sp. feeding on 46% of eggs. Predator exposure reduced overall billbug activity by 56%, and for hunting billbugs, specifically, reduced mating activity by 28%. Our new understanding of the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators on billbugs supports the importance of conservation biocontrol in turfgrass and assists in planning for enhancement of specific predators."

Most broods are reared by their parents alone, but 23 of 195 (12%) broods combined and were reared communally by all their living parents. A 26% greater fledgling rate of communally reared chicks was not statistically significant. Parents of communal broods lived significantly longer (3.1 years) than parents of single broods (1.9 years) and hatched Significantly more young (36.3 vs. 15.7 young) during their lifetimes. Those that raised their first surviving brood communally were significantly (2.8 times) more likely to hatch a brood the following year. Communal brood fathers sentineled significantly less and ate significantly more. We do not know whether parents initiated brood merging, thereby increasing their direct fitness, or the young initiated brood merging, thereby increasing their inclusive fitness. Broods combined only when they were hatched from nearby nests. Communal brood rearing may be constrained by the absence of pre-hatch contact between the parents, or by the limited mobility of young chicks."

Such an experiment is also supplemental to the smart city concept as it can help to identify whether there is a delay on air quality improvement during or after a sharp decline on traffic and to determine what, if any, factors are contributing to that time lag. As such, this study investigates the immediate impacts of COVID-19 causing abrupt declines on traffic and NO2 concentration in all Florida Counties through March 2020. Daily tropospheric NO2 concentrations were extracted from the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and vehicle mile traveled (VMT) estimates were acquired from cell phone mobility records. It is observed that overall impacts of the COVID-19 response in Florida have started in the first half of the March 2020, two weeks earlier than the official stay-at-home orders, and resulted in 54.07% and 59.68% decrease by the end of the month on NO2 and VMT, respectively. Further, a cross-correlation based dependency analysis was conducted to analyze the similarities and associated time lag between 7-day moving averages of VMT and NO2 concentrations of the 67 counties. Although such reduction is unprecedented for both data sets, results indicate a strong correlation and this correlation increases with the identification of a time lag between VMT and NO2 concentration. Majority of the counties have no time lag between VMT and NO2 concentration; however, a cluster of South Florida counties presents earlier decrease on NO2 concentration compare to VMT, which indicates that the air quality improvements in those counties are not traffic related. Investigation on the socioeconomic factors indicates that population density and income level have no significant impact on the time lag between traffic and air quality improvements in light of COVID-19."

Extensive research has examined the consequences of predation risk from large carnivores on the behavior of wild ungulate prey species. However, many large carnivores not only hunt wild prey but also depredate domestic livestock, especially in pastoralist systems where livestock share land and resources with large carnivores. Northern Tanzania is a hotspot for human-carnivore conflict driven by livestock depredation and interactions are particularly severe between African lions Panthera leo and pastoralist cattle Bos taurus. In this ecosystem, we explored the degree to which pastoralist cattle exhibited anti-predator behaviors during their daily grazing routines. Using focal animal sampling, we compared two typical anti-predator behaviors, vigilance and grouping, among cattle in village rangelands with high and low background depredation rates. We found that cattle in high risk village rangelands formed 21.2% larger groups than cattle in low risk village rangelands. Interestingly, cattle in low risk village rangelands spent 68.4% more time vigilant than cattle in high risk village rangelands. These patterns were influenced significantly by the time of day: as sunset approached, cattle in low risk village rangelands spent more time vigilant and cattle in high risk village rangelands formed larger groups. These results suggest that pastoralist cattle exhibit anti-predator strategies that vary both spatially and temporally, and that such strategies might help livestock optimally tradeoff the costs and benefits of anti-predator behavior across timescales (i.e. the risk allocation hypothesis). We discuss the implications of our results for husbandry techniques that might reduce behavioral costs associated with cattle anti-predator behaviors and help increase tolerance for lions and other large carnivores. These improvements are critical to human-carnivore coexistence given the prevalence of pastoralism globally and the rising potential for conflict with large carnivores such as lions."

These dredging operations facilitate the elimination of sediments that the coastal dynamics introduce. Dredging operations are increasingly restrictive and costly due to environmental requirements. Understanding the condition of the seabed before and after dredging is essential. In addition, determining how the seabed has behaved in recent years is important to consider when planning future dredging operations. In order to analyze the behavior of sediment transport and the changes to the seabed due to sedimentation, studies of littoral dynamics are conducted to model the deposition of sediments. Another methodology that could be used to analyze the real behavior of sediments would be to study and compare port bathymetries collected periodically. The problem with this methodology is that it requires numerous bathymetric surveys to produce a sufficiently significant analysis. This study provides an effective solution for obtaining a dense time series of bathymetry mapping using satellite data, and enables the past behavior of the seabed to be examined. The methodology proposed in this work uses Sentinel-2A (10 m resolution) satellite images to obtain historical bathymetric series by the development of a random forest algorithm. From these historical bathymetric series, it is possible to determine how the seabed has behaved and how the entry of sediments into the study area occurs. This methodology is applied in the Port of Luarca (Principality of Asturias), obtaining satellite images and extracting successive bathymetry mapping utilizing the random forest algorithm. This work reveals how once the dock was dredged, the sediments were redeposited and the seabed recovered its level prior to dredging in less than 2 months."

Braun; Gore, Jeffery A.; Ober, Holly K.","Evidence of resource-defense polygyny in an endangered subtropical bat, Eumops floridanus",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,24,,,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01289,2020,"Understanding sociality and animal behavior is critical for developing effective conservation strategies. Many tropical bat species form harems, where dominant males play key social roles by defending groups of females directly (female-defense polygyny) and/or the resources that females need (resource-defense polygyny). The Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus) is an endangered subtropical species suspected to form harems, but our understanding of its social structure, reproduction, and behavior is rudimentary. In this study, we evaluated demographic variation in morphological and behavioral characteristics of Florida bonneted bats to test the hypothesis that this species forms harem groups and exhibits resource-defense polygyny at roost sites. We used a 4-year dataset of 341 individuals uniquely marked with passive integrated transponders (PIT tags), coupled with tri-annual capture records, to track activity patterns of bats at five roosts fitted with PIT tag readers. We identified the likely dominant males and other demographic groups in each roost using morphometric characteristics and reproductive status. We assessed differences between sexes and among status categories in three primary metrics: amount of activity at the roost, time of emergence, and initial foray duration per night. Dominant males consistently were the most active individuals at roosts and spent the least amount of time away from roosts during forays, relative to females and other males. Females spent more time away from roosts than males and shared similar foraging activity patterns regardless of status. Our findings suggest that Florida bonneted bats form small harem groups that are active year round. Male bats exhibit characteristics of resource-defense polygyny at roost sites and a size-biased hierarchy, with the largest reproductively active males appearing to defend the roost at the expense of time spent foraging. We suggest that the roost site represents a critical, limited and defendable resource for male Florida bonneted bats to gain access to females, which has important implications for the conservation and enhancement of roost sites. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for differences in behavior across demographic groups and social roles when considering resource needs for imperiled species. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

"POST, W; SEALS, CA",NESTING ASSOCIATIONS OF LEAST BITTERNS AND BOAT-TAILED GRACKLES,CONDOR,95,139,144,10.2307/1369395,1993,"Interspecific nesting assemblages may result from independent settlement by individuals or groups of each species in the same limited habitat, or association with other species may be actively sought. Although Least Bitterns (Ixobrychus exilis) often nest solitarily, in a South Carolina impoundment they frequently associated with colonies of Boat-tailed grackles (Quiscalus major). Bittern nests inside and outside colonies occupied the same microhabitats. However, more bitterns nested in grackle colonies than in equal-sized areas of equivalent habitat in the same marsh. In one of two years, colonial bitterns had higher reproductive success than bitterns nesting outside colonies. We conclude that Least Bitterns actively associate with grackles. Possible reasons for the association of bitterns with grackles are as follows (1) Critical density effect: at high population densities, the advantages of dispersed (cryptic) nesting are lost. Bitterns switching to nest in groups may experience little reduction in reproductive success, relative to those nesting solitarily. (2) Vigilance and mobbing: grackles provide early warning, and actively exclude predatory birds from colonies. Bitterns nesting among grackles appeared to incur few costs, such as may result from competition for food or from intracolony predation."

The study was carried out near Lodi (northern Italy). Hooded crows were attracted to the area by baiting with maize seeds. To assess exactly the positions and orientations of the crows in the flocks, a new photographic method was employed which obtains planar maps of the flocks from prospective images (slides, movies). The time individuals in the flocks devoted to vigilance for predators (<<scanning>> behaviour) and the time elapsing between successive scanning events were also recorded for a sample of individuals in flocks of different sizes. Crows had an aggregated dispersion within the experimental area but tended to disperse uniformly within the area effectively occupied by the flock. A new method to quantify the reciprocal orientation is also proposed. Neighbouring crows avoided face to face and face away reciprocal orientations and maintained intermediate reciprocal orientations. The time allocated to <<scanning>> behaviour was negatively related and the duration of the inter-scan interval was positively related to the size of the flock. Both the geometry of flocks and the scanning behaviour of individuals were strongly influenced by social factors."

An intermittent study in Namibia of 11 radio-tagged individuals, with over 250 h of direct observation, was done between 2000 and 2004 to document their basic natural history, including their social organization. The study was terminated when noki numbers collapsed, probably due to predation by an expanding population of black mongooses (Galerella nigrata) that was unintentionally provisioned with food at a nearby eco-tourist Lodge. Mate and female adults were distributed as monogamous pairs on home ranges that were similar in size and shape. The pair bond was strong, with many coordinated behaviours. Reproduction was seasonal with titters of single highly precocial young. Multiple generations remained on the parental home range without significant aggression. Most aggression was between adult mates, white adult females showed tolerance towards each other and intruding adult mates. Although noki social monogamy is probably the result of mate mate guarding, considerable paternal care was observed, including allogrooming and vigilance against predators. Nokis have a relatively Low metabolic rate and numerous thermoregutatory behaviours that suggest that nocturnal huddling by the mate with his mate and young may be an important factor in the evolution of their social monogamy.

We tested hypotheses regarding possible ultimate causes of sleeping site selection in light of our results. Langurs selected the ledges and caves on cliffs as sleeping sites. Of 23 identified sleeping sites, 7 were more frequently used than the others (a parts per thousand yen9 times each, accounting for 64% of total observed nights). Langurs used most sleeping sites repeatedly, and reused some of them on consecutive nights; 4 consecutive nights were the longest run. We suggest that langurs choose sleeping sites to make approach and attack difficult by predators, and to increase familiarity so as to improve chances for escape. Langurs' cryptic behaviors before entering sleeping sites and the rapid movement toward sleeping sites (4 min on average) with an increased level of vigilance may help to decrease the possibility of detection by predators. Access to food appears to have a profound influence on sleeping site selection in Fran double dagger ois' langurs, as demonstrated by the langurs' tendency to select sleeping sites close to their current main feeding sites. The position of sleeping site relative to the last feeding site of the day and the first feeding site of the subsequent morning indicated a strategy closer to that of a multiple central place forager than of a central place forager. Our results do not support the influences of other factors, e.g., avoidance of parasites, seeking comfort, and range or resource defense, on sleeping site selection."

Knot nested within territories which were of little importance as a food source. Males defended territories by singing from the ground, aerial chases, threat displays (horizontal point), fighting, and low flights in which the wings were held vertically over the back (V-wing flights).Songflights performed by males seemed to serve a mate-attraction function. The commonest heterosexual display was a tail-up display, used mainly by males prior to clutch completion. Males also used a nest scrape display and a ground point display in advertising potential nest sites to females. Behaviour preceding copulation was variable but usually included tail-up displays and the male pecking the back of the female.Anti-predator behaviour when on the nest involved remaining still until a predator was very close, whereupon distraction displays were used. Both sexes incubated but only males cared for chicks. Caring for chicks involved leading chicks to favourable feeding areas, brooding and vigilance, distraction displays, and harrassment or physical attack of avian predators.The displays used by breeding Knot tend to be unlike those of most congenerics and suggest that the Knot is a rather peripheral member of Calidris."
Shi Xiaolong; Li Zhongqiu,Do social rank and food supplementation affect grooming behavior? A test in Pere David's deer,Acta Theriologica Sinica,37,53,58,10.16829/j.slxb.201701003,2017,"Previous studies have shown that several factors including sex, age, tick density, and season affect oral grooming behavior of reintroduced Pere David's deer in Dafeng Nature Reserve, China, and reintroduction of wild animals should consider if they retain regular grooming patterns thus to control ectoparasites especially the ticks. In this study we further examined two more factors, social rank and food availability, which might influence grooming behavior of Pere David's deer. Harem masters, who usually have a higher level of testosterone, are predicted to groom less than bachelors during the rutting season. However, we did not find any differences in rate of grooming behavior between the harem master and bachelors probably due to the late rutting season when the testosterone levels have fallen off. Food supplementation might affect grooming behavior since released foraging pressure would provide much more time for other behaviors such as grooming. However, we did not find an effect of food availability, probably due to an increase of vigilance instead of grooming in the pavilion population. Our results suggest that more explorations are needed such as changing observation time and excluding the interference of visitors"

Families of pikas occupied relatively discrete home ranges that contained a burrow system with many entrances in continuous alpine-meadow habitat. Some burrow systems contained a monogamous pair of breeding adults; in others one male controlled access to two or more females. During the breeding period, adult males vigorously guarded females with which they were associated. Young from three sequential large litters occupied their natal home ranges and did not disperse during the reproductive season. Density on individual home ranges increased throughout the study, and population density reached ca. 300 animals/ha following emergence of the third litter. Most interactions among adults involved reproduction (following, approaching, mating) and occurred early in the summer. Most social interactions were affiliative and were between adults and juveniles within family home ranges. Most of these interactions involved adult males. Adult males also were responsible for most other behaviors that could be associated with vigilance and awareness of the social milieu on the meadow and with maintenance of home-range quality. There was no indication that rate of affiliative behavior differed among males from variable mating systems."

We tested whether or not food-deprived male house mice (Mus musculus) spent less time on non-vigilant behaviors (feeding, grooming) when exposed to the odor of a corn snake (Elaphe guttata) compared to control odors (distilled water or deer urine). Although mice exposed to snake odor did not spend less time feeding or grooming, they did respond differently to the odors depending on their percent weight loss during food deprivation. Mice exposed to snake odor and that had a lower percent weight loss engaged in fewer feeding bouts and tended to wait longer to eat than did mice exposed to water. Interestingly, mice that were exposed to snake odor and ate sooner fed at a higher rate per feeding bout than did mice exposed to deer urine. Our results suggest that mice that did not lose as much weight did not take as many risks when exposed to a potential predator. However, if mice did lose more weight, they took more risks (e. g. engaged in more feeding bouts), but may diminish these risks by feeding more quickly."

I examined several factors that could influence the choice to sleep communally and the composition of sleeping associations in Microcebus griseorufus, an inhabitant of the subarid spiny forest of southern Madagascar. These include the quantity and quality of available sleeping sites, socio-territoriality, predation risk, and thermoregulation. I radiotracked 26 individuals (12 males and 14 females) and recorded 222 uses of 151 sleeping sites. Mouse lemurs slept most often in tree forks and tangles of vegetation and preferred sleeping sites in Alluaudia spp. (36%) and Euphorbia spp. (30%), 2 very common tree genera in the spiny forest. Sleeping associations allowed the animals to use larger and more extensively overlapping home ranges and to have access to more food. Predation risk was much higher during nocturnal activity than during diurnal rest. Sleeping groups were small, usually pairs. Animals showed no signs of vigilance in sleeping sites and did not huddle consistently. Sleeping sites were chosen for their inaccessibility to predators and were well buffered against high and low ambient temperatures. Therefore, sleeping association was better explained by social territoriality than by predation pressure or thermoregulation. DOI: 10.1644/09-MAMM-A-239.1."

Callitrichids are small-bodied primates that mob multiple types of predators. Though there have been several observations of callitrichids mobbing predators in the wild, their anecdotal nature provides only rough descriptions of behavior and vocalizations. Researchers could neither spectrographically identify nor quantify vocalizations owing to the limitations of observing predation in the field. We examined in detail the mobbing response of 1 callitrichid species, the cotton-top tamarin, in captivity. We recorded vocalizations for quantitative analysis and observed behavior qualitatively. We report 3 new vocalizations that had not been described in the original repertoire for the cotton-top tamarin. Analysis of the time course of a mobbing session yielded a pattern in which the highest intensity mobbing vocalizations decreased over the session even though lower intensity vocalizing continued, which may reflect a shifting strategy from mobbing to vigilance. The rate of calling during mobbing sessions differed from the rate of calling during control sessions. We discuss the vocalizations in relation to 2 hypotheses of form and function of antipredator calls. The newly described mobbing vocalizations may have an important impact on the study of mobbing because they represent a class of vocalizations that researchers have largely ignored in studies of callitrichids, thus raising new issues concerning past and future research on antipredator behavior in the family."

This insect-induced root volatile attracts entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) and thereby helps to protect the roots against herbivore damage. Previous studies suggest that diffusion of E beta c occurs through the gaseous rather than the aqueous phase in sand and its diffusion is best at low levels of humidity. However, it remains largely unknown how E beta c diffuses in typical natural and agricultural soils. To fully understand the function and efficiency of root-produced E beta c as a belowground signal it is important to know how it spreads in real soils and how soil properties affect its diffusion. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses, the diffusion of two doses of synthetic E beta c (200 ng and 20,000 ng) injected in sand was compared with the diffusion of E beta c injected in clay, clay-loam and sandy-loam soils, at 3 moisture levels (5, 10 and 20% water), and at two distances (5 and 10 cm) from the E beta c injection point. The diffusion of the compound was measured with a Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) fiber every 30 minutes over a period of 9 hours. We found that, in contrast to the pattern observed for pure sand, E beta c diffused best when humidity was high in the three agricultural soils. In subsequent experiments we used glass-trays to create two types of mesocosms to assess the effect of synthetic or root-produced E beta c on the dispersal of the EPN Heterorhabditis megidis and its infection of sentinel hosts in the trays. The presence of synthetic E beta c did not affect the ability of H. megidis to infect the sentinel host. However, under the test conditions, E beta c released from maize roots influenced the migration behaviour of H. megidis depending on soil type. The results suggest that D. virgifera-damaged maize plants may recruit H. megidis more efficiently in clay loam soils than in other types of soil. These new insights into the diffusion dynamics and attraction efficiency of the root-produced signal E beta c may help efforts to develop novel strategies for the sustainable management of the maize pest D. virgifera."

Learning about predators can occur through direct experience or through social learning from experienced individuals. Social learning provides individuals with an effective means of acquiring information while reducing the costs associated with direct learning. Under a natural setting, social learning is likely to occur between more than two individuals. As such, investigating the effect that group size has on the ability of individuals to acquire information is vital to understanding social learning dynamics. Given the characteristics of coral reefs and the biology of coral reef fishes, these habitats are an ideal medium to test whether group size affects the transmission of information. Using newly settled damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis), we examined whether the number of observers present influences transmission of information. We showed that: (1) predator recognition is socially transmitted from predator-experienced to predator-na < ve individuals regardless of group size, and that (2) the level of response displayed by the observer does not differ following learning in different sized groups. Our study highlights that information on predator identities is able to be passed onto group members quickly without a dilution of information content."
"Cresswell, W",Interference competition at low competitor densities in blackbirds Turdus merula,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,66,461,471,10.2307/5941,1997,"1. Interference competition in a wild population of European blackbirds was examined by comparing the feeding rates of individual birds feeding alone and with the addition of a competitor within small, experimental feeding patches.2. Blackbirds showed type II functional responses. There was a highly significant decrease in feeding rate on addition of a competing individual to a patch: average declines in feeding rates of an individual on addition of a competitor, where nearest neighbour distance was always less than about 5 m, were between 16% and 43% of the feeding rate of a lone individual.3. The decline in feeding rate was similar whether the individuals interacted aggressively or apparently ignored each other during feeding. When patch size was doubled, the effects on feeding rate of adding a single competitor remained similar. The high levels of interference recorded may therefore have been mainly a consequence of active rather than passive interference competition.4. The results suggest that the costs to an individual blackbird of monitoring other individuals within a group in order to avoid interactions may be sufficiently high to counter any benefits of group feeding, such as vigilance benefits."

Piping plovers forage along the tidal oceanfront, in the dunes, and in backbays, and their relative use of these habitats partially depends on the presence of people. Within each habitat the plovers select sites that contain fewer people than the habitat as a whole. The time devoted to vigilance (when they are not searching for food) is directly related to the number of people near them, and to the overall human use of that habitat. Thus, in habitats with few people the plovers can spend 90% of their foraging time actively searching for prey and feeding, whereas on beaches with many people they may spend less than 50% of their foraging time in direct feeding behaviors. A diversity of habitats allows the birds to move between habitats to minimize interactions with people and maximize the time devoted to foraging. The results suggest that it is critical to maintain high habitat diversity in coastal environments to help mitigate competition with people."

Sparrows did not desert nests following various clutch manipulations that are often associated with parasitism, indicating that desertion was not in response to the presence of cowbird eggs. Sparrows often deserted nests following encounters vith real or mounted cowbirds, suggesting that nest desertion is a response to adult cowbirds. Sparrows deserted nests only in stages most vulnerable to the effects of parasitism. That finding is consistent with the possibility that desertion is a parasite-specific response. Sparrows arrived at nests earlier in the da, at our Illinois site, where parasitism was greater, than in Missouri. Our findings confirm that host vigilance can prevent successful parasitism, and we provide the first direct evidence that encounters with cowbirds may cause hosts to desert nests. Our findings may help explain why cowbirds parasitize nests extremely early in the morning and lay rapidly,. We suggest that consideration be given to host response following interactions with adult brood parasites because those interactions may have implications for both the ecology and evolution of both the parasite and host."

To interpret our results in the framework of foraging theory, we studied the influence of individual feeding rate on the decisions to move and to attack flock companions. Birds changed their position within the flock more often when their intake rate was low and sometimes attacked conspecifics to supplant them from their feeding place. Aggressors significantly avoided front attacks and were almost always successful. They attacked individuals having higher feeding rates than themselves and their own feeding rate significantly increased after the attack, although victims were not chased off to particularly poor sites. Our results suggest that aggressors could obtain reliable information about the quality of the foraging site they coveted by observing their victims feeding activity before attacking. Although aggression seemed to be caused by a low intake rate, we show that displacing another bird was more time-consuming than independent foraging. We conclude that it was not the most profitable behaviour in terms of energy intake. Foraging site displacement probably also had social functions, such as reinforcement of social status in a flock of birds preparing for pre-breeding migration."
"Graw, Beke; Manser, Marta B.",The function of mobbing in cooperative meerkats,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,74,507,517,10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.11.021,2007,"To show context appropriate antipredator behaviour, animals require information about a predator's motivation to hunt, and consequently the level of danger to which they are exposed at any given moment. In addition to deterring a predator, mobbing behaviour, in which animals approach a potential predator, might also provide information useful in predation risk assessment. Here we present the results of an experimental study on meerkats, Suricata suricatta, which showed mobbing behaviour in a variety of predator contexts. Groups were presented with a number of predators of varying threat levels, and with non-threatening animals. Responses to these stimuli by the different individuals in the groups, and vigilance behaviour before and after each presentation, were compared. Meerkats seemed to use mobbing not only to deter predators, but also to gather information about potential threats and adjust their behaviour accordingly. In particular, mobbing of nondangerous animals indicates the role of this behaviour in contexts other than just directed towards predators. Differences between age categories suggest that mobbing changes with experience, and may allow young to learn about predators by observing adults. We conclude that mobbing has a broader function beyond predator deterrence, and facilitates situational risk assessment on which subsequent decisions may be based.

We tested this assumption by manipulating clutch and brood size of wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and subsequently monitoring survival of ducklings. Offspring survival in enlarged broods tended to be lower than in control broods. By 14 days after hatching, enlarged broods had no more ducklings surviving than did controls. Brooding efficiency (i.e., the effectiveness of hear transfer from a care-giving female to her young) was evaluated with captive mallards in an environmental chamber where we manipulated ambient temperature and brood size, and monitored duckling temperature (T-d). There was no difference in T-d in broods of different sizes, but variation in T-d increased with brood size. Under natural conditions, the female's inability to effectively cover large broods could reduce duckling survival. Thus, brooding may represent one posthatching behaviour that could limit clutch size in precocial birds. This study provides new insights regarding the implications of brood size on the survival of precocial young."

We studied mortality patterns and grouping behavior of white-nosed coatis (Nasua narica) at sites in southern Arizona, USA, and western Jalisco, Mexico. Coatis were monitored by radio-tracking and recaptures for more than 3 years at each site. In both populations, predation by large felids, including jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Plana concolor), accounted for more than 50% of mortality of adult coatis. Predation rates were significantly higher on solo coatis than on coatis in groups at both study sites. Predation rates were negatively related to group size in Arizona. However, mortality of juveniles, as measured by the ratios of juveniles to adult females, was not related to the number of adult females per group in Arizona or Jalisco. Coatis exhibit a suite of behaviors, including foraging with the juveniles in the center of the group, sharing vigilance, alarm calling, mobbing and attacking predators, and a highly synchronous birth season, that are all consistent with the hypothesis that predation has played an important role in shaping coati social behavior."

Over the last two decades, researchers have focused their attention on how teammates may influence athletes' eating attitudes and behaviours. Objective: To systematically review the literature relating to teammate influences on athletes' eating attitudes and behaviours. Method: A systematic literature search of the SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases was conducted. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) examined the relationship between teammate influence and eating attitudes and/or behaviours; (2) sampled actively training athletes; (3) written in English; and (4) published in a peer-reviewed academic journal. Results: Twenty-four studies were included (n = 13 quantitative, n = 11 qualitative). Included studies were found to be of good or reasonable quality. Mechanisms of influence were categorised as (1) Teammate support (e.g., supportive teammate friendships, promotion of healthy eating practices, vigilance against disordered eating), and (2) Teammate pressure (e.g., conflicting teammate friendships, critical comments and appearance conversations, maladaptive team norms, and competitive comparisons). Conclusion: Teammates are an important source of influence on athlete eating attitudes and behaviours and these influences can be protective against, or engender an increased risk for, disordered eating. Additional, prospective research is required to enhance understanding of the mechanisms of teammate influences and to inform the development of interventions to reduce disordered eating among athletes."
"Hogstad, Olav","Social behaviour in the non-breeding season in Great Tits Parus major and Willow Tits Poecile montanus: differences in juvenile birds' route to territorial ownership, and pair-bond stability and mate protection in adults",Ornis Norvegica,38,1,8,10.15845/on.v38i0.800,2015,"Great Tits Parus major and Willow Tits Poecile montanus are small passerine monogamous species that live in dominance-structured flocks outside the breeding season. Within such flocks, males dominate females, and within sex, adults generally dominate juveniles (first-year birds). However, whereas Willow Tits maintain a yearlong defence of large territories and their flocks have a constant membership, the Great Tits maintain looser organizations of their flocks that vary in size, and the birds move around irrespective of territorial ranges. I compared the aggressive behaviour between juvenile conspecifics of Great and Willow Tits from July through April during 2004-2014, and the intra-pair behaviour of adults during November-February in 2011-2014 in a subalpine forest in Budal, central Norway. Two maxima of aggressive interactions were found among juveniles of both species: one in August-September and one in March-April. For Great Tits the autumn-interactions were probably due to competition for food, whereas the spring-interactions reflected competition for territorial space. For Willow Tits, the interactions in August - September were caused by competition for flock membership and ownership for a territory in March-April. Because flock membership in general is the only possible way to territory ownership, also the aggressive behaviour among juvenile Willow Tits in autumn is most likely linked to territorial behaviour. I found three circumstances of immediate benefits of the pair bond for adult Willow Tits that are consistent with the hypothesis of mate protection and that differed from that of Great Tit pairs: Willow Tits had a shorter intra-pair distance, females received less aggression, and they had a higher foraging rate when accompanied by their mate than did females of Great Tit pairs. One out of the five Great Tit pairs studied became divorced, whereas the bonds of three Willow Tit pairs were stable over at least three to four years."

Daily observations were performed since the day of pair formation. Escorting behaviour began 4 days prior to laying and declined sharply between the 2 and 3 days of the laying period. Males followed their females more than the reverse, and spent more than 90% of time in the colony with the female during her fertile period. When escorting the females, males actively chased off other males to prevent them appproaching their mate. While males escorted females during fertile period up to 100% of times when they left colony, females came back to colony without their mate nearly 30% of times, showing that females succeeded in escaping their mate Vigilance when moving outside the colony. These results suggest that males guard in aim to keep other males away from their female, but also to keep females from approaching other males. Most of the observed copulations occurred during the guarding period. No extra-pair copulations (EPC) were witnessed between individuals of breeding pairs during the study time. One attempt of EPC occurred between a male of focal pair and a female of non-focal unstable pair. Nestbox occupation by unstable pairs and the shortness of time separating pair formation and laying in intermediate breeding pairs are discussed."

The topography of the total field, particularly the binocular field, is similar to that of European Golden Plovers Pluvialis apricaria. We suggest that the 'foot-trembling' behaviour associated with foraging in Plovers is not under visual guidance but forces the escape of hidden prey, which is detected when the prey item moves into the binocular field to enable its capture in the bill. Foot-trembling thus functions to extend the effective foraging area of a bird beyond the limits of its visual field."

We examined the effect of predation risk on foraging A. uniparens in outdoor enclosures, observing their behavior in the presence and absence of the predatory lizard Gambelia wislizenii. Predator presence led to changes in activity patterns and foraging behavior. When predators were present, A. uniparens reduced both the proportion of time active and time moving, shifted activity periods, reduced their movement rate, and changed the duration of moves. There were no apparent changes in digging effort, but the likelihood of successfully digging for food decreased when a predator was present."

This allows dolphins to maintain consciousness in response to respiratory demands of the ocean. Unihemispheric sleep may also allow dolphins to maintain vigilant states over long periods of time. Because of the relatively poor visibility in the ocean, dolphins use echolocation to interrogate their environment. During echolocation, dolphin produce clicks and listen to returning echoes to determine the location and identity of objects. The extent to which individual dolphins are able to maintain continuous vigilance through this active sense is unknown. Here we show that dolphins may continuously echolocate and accurately report the presence of targets for at least 15 days without interruption. During a total of three sessions, each lasting five days, two dolphins maintained echolocation behaviors while successfully detecting and reporting targets. Overall performance was between 75 to 86% correct for one dolphin and 97 to 99% correct for a second dolphin. Both animals demonstrated diel patterns in echolocation behavior. A 15-day testing session with one dolphin resulted in near perfect performance with no significant decrement over time. Our results demonstrate that dolphins can continuously monitor their environment and maintain long-term vigilant behavior through echolocation."
"Magige, Flora J.",Group-size effect on scanning behaviour of Maasai Ostrich Struthio camelus massaicus,Scopus,37,38,41,,2017,"Scanning behaviour enables birds to collect information important for their survival, such as detecting predators (anti-predatory strategy) and searching for food. The scanning behaviour of the Common Ostrich Struthio camelus was investigated by determining the scanning duration (total seconds during 5-min periods that a bird's head was raised) and scanning rate (number of times an individual raised its head per minute) among different group sizes in late 2006 in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. A total of 14 males and 20 females were observed. Scanning duration was a function of group size where individuals in small groups scanned for longer times than individuals in large groups. However, increasing group size did not have a significant effect on the scanning rate among the groups. Individual vigilance among ostriches is influenced by group size, whereas individual scanning rate may be influenced by factors other than group size, such as body size and habitat type. Higher scanning duration in small groups is attributed to anti-predatory behaviour."

In order to determine what, if any, impact the presence of guests in the exhibit had on the zoo's Bennett's wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus) instantaneous scan sampling was used to observe behavioral observations and location in the yard and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite measures (FGM) were collected from individual animals. There was no difference in wallaby FGM level when the yard was open and the yard was closed. The wallabies spent less time resting and less time within 15 feet of the guest path when the yard was open. As the number of guests increased, the time the wallabies spent engaged in visitor directed vigilance increased, Despite these changes in behaviors there was no evidence that the wallabies were adversely impacted by the presence of guests."
"Beauchamp, Guy",Half-Blind to the Risk of Predation,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,5,,,10.3389/fevo.2017.00131,2017,"Blinking serves several functions in animals, but it comes at the cost of intermittent blindness. Blinking can occur spontaneously, but it is commonly associated with head movements. As feeding animals often need to move the head down repeatedly to gather resources, intermittent blindness might represent a hitherto unappreciated cost of feeding. In addition, this cost might also be more prevalent in larger groups as feeding effort typically increases with group size. In chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), blinks associated with head movements occurred at a high frequently during feeding bouts. While blinks tended to be short, the amount of time spent blinking was close to 50% when feeding and increased with group size. By contrast, time spent blinking was much lower when birds simply monitored their surroundings between feeding bouts. Intermittent blinking at this scale when feeding is likely to decrease the ability to detect predation threats in a timely fashion and to monitor neighbors effectively."

We examined whether Eurasian Coots Fulica atra copy diving behavior from their neighbors, predicting that decision-making in focal birds is strongly influenced by diving activities of close neighbors. According to generalized linear mixed models we used, positive significant predictors of diving events in focal birds for a given moment were the occurrence of diving activities of neighbors up to five body lengths in the previous moment, as well as the interaction between the proportion of diving neighbors and the total number of nearby neighbors. By contrast, behavior of focal individuals was a negative significant predictor; diving activities of nearest neighbors did not reach statistical significance. Our study shows that decision-making of group foragers may be influenced not only by the actions of nearest neighbors but also of a greater number of individuals in their vicinity, as well as their own behavior, which should be taken into account in future research."

In king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonica), sleep may be disturbed by congeners passing in the sleeper's vicinity. As king penguin activity is increased in the morning, sleep disturbances are more likely to occur during this time period. One might therefore assume that afternoon sleepers (AS) sleep more profoundly than morning sleepers (MS). To test this hypothesis, we examined the diurnal variations in sleep depth of king penguins sleeping in resting sites adjacent to the colony of La Baie du Marin (Crozet Archipelago). We measured the bodily tactile arousal threshold at the upper back level. The arousal threshold in AS was twice as high as in MS. This study demonstrates for the first time that sleep depth changes according to time of day in a diurnal wild bird. We postulate that diurnal sleep depth is increased due to decreased congener movements close to the sleeping penguin."

We investigated geophagy in the Critically Endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Lagothrix flavicauda). We collected observational data and camera trap records over 2 years at La Esperanza study site, northern Peru. Geophagy was rare, with 67 events recorded during the study. All age/sex classes engaged in geophagy, but adult males spent significantly less time consuming earthin situthan adult females did. Geophagy occurred predominantly during the dry season and was a solitary behavior. The forest floor is presumably a high-risk environment for these predominantly arboreal primates and our study animals employed various strategies to minimize predation risk. These included using a single route to access and leave geophagy sites, displaying increased vigilance behaviors before and during geophagy events, and minimizing the time spent on the forest floor (mean: 15 +/- SD 9 s). They also maximized the benefits of being on the forest floor by removing earth to consumeex situ.These findings provide the first steps in the systemic approach required to understand the role geophagy plays in our study species, whose almost exclusive arboreality, coupled with the increased predation risk associated with terrestriality, suggests that geophagy confers an important benefit."

However, only a few such studies have examined how foraging parameters are influenced by different personality domains. In wild ungulates, the trade-off between the time spent on food intake and antipredator behaviour differs between individuals, but the underlying reason for this is not yet well understood. One possibility is that this trade-off reflects personality dimensions such as boldness. To relate foraging decisions to personality we measured personality and performed feeding experiments with familiar and novel food in familiar and novel situations. We measured personality traits in 15 tame fallow deer, using novel object tests (NO), behavioural observations (BO) and personality ratings (PR). Boldness dimensions were found using PR and NO, dominance dimensions were found using BO and PR, and a flexibility dimension was found using BO. Multitrait-multimethod analysis showed that similar dimensions were significantly correlated across different methods and that different dimensions were not significantly correlated, even if measured using the same method. We also found that novel food eaten in familiar situations and familiar food eaten in novel situations were strongly related to boldness but not dominance, flexibility or age. Thus the trade-off between the benefits of gaining more food and the costs of reduced vigilance or increased toxin ingestion reflect boldness. These findings highlight the nature of personality dimensions in ungulates and how boldness impacts foraging behaviour. (c) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In order to develop appropriate management plans for both avian and human use of natural environments it is essential to understand how people affect foraging birds. The foraging behaviour of five species of water-birds at Loxahatchee (Arthur B. Marshall National Wildlife Refuge), part of the Everglades, in Southern Florida was observed, between 1992 and 1994, from a dike that received many visitors. Species examined included common gallinule (Gallinula chloropus), sera rail (Porzana carolina), glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), little blue heron (Egretta caerulea) and Louisiana heron (E. tricolor). These birds were observed before people were near, while people were present, and following the departure of people. Variation in feeding behaviour was largely explained by whether people were present, the number of people present, and the amount of noise made by the people. For all species, time devoted to feeding and number of strikes or pecks decreased while people were present. The percentage of time spent foraging and the number of strikes decreased as the noise made by people increased. Birds that were closer to the path flew away from people more often than birds that were further away. Birds usually swam or flew away from the path while people were present."

We report and quantify for the first time in Amblypygi prolonged mother-offspring-sibling associations, active aggregation, and frequent amicable- (tolerant, nonaggressive) tactile interactions in two species: Phrynus marginemaculatus C.L. Koch 1840 (Phrynidae) and Damon diadema (Simon, 1876) (Phrynichidae). Sociality is characterized by frequent contact and tolerance, and infrequent agonism until Sexual maturity in D. diadema and into adulthood in P. marginemaculatas. We experimentally examined potential benefits and costs affecting aggregation: risk of predation, preferred habitats and prey availability. Only increased predation risk decreased nearest-neighbor distances and increased maternal vigilance. Individuals aggregated on a variety of surface textures and locations that varied daily, rather than aggregating only on preferred rnicrohabitats. Manipulation of prey abundance had no affect on the tendency to aggregate.Patterns of parental care, duration of association, and the presence of social traits found in the most social taxa of non-spider arachnids are reviewed. Species in most arachnid orders have transient parental care with defense of eggs, a brief period of association with newly emerged Young prior to independent foraging and explosive dispersal from the natal nest. More prolonged sociality, with long-term associations among mothers-offspring-siblings is rare and is only described in a few species in the Amblypygi, Scorpionida, Pseudoscorpionida, and Acari. All Such species have subsocial origins, but current use of the term subsocial is overly broad and we propose a more restricted terminology for clarity."

Results indicated that the auditory stimuli caused by local people provoked the most pronounced disturbance to Grus monacha. Human-caused disturbances not only frequently interrupt the feeding process of crane, but also lead to an increase in vigilance duration by 200% and a significant increase in flying time from 21 to 43 min in a day (p<0.05). In addition, high-intensity noise can cause larger flushing distance; the foraging cranes will flush away by about 600 m when disturbed by the honking of vehicles. Whistle and shout produced by local farmers in field generate the largest sound intensity, about 120 dB, which cause a flushing distance of over 700 m. Food availability at the stopover sites may affect hooded cranes' diet composition. Limited by food availability, the health condition of the G. monacha arriving late is inferior to those arriving early. To reduce the negative effect of human-caused disturbances on the hooded cranes, it is imperative to define a buffer zone around the sensitive areas during the stopover period in fall. To solve the conflicts between the farmers' interest and the hooded cranes' demand of crops, financial compensation to the farmers for the crops eaten by G. rnnnacha is necessary for a better conservation of this vulnerable bird species."
"Janson, CH",Testing the predation hypothesis for vertebrate sociality: Prospects and pitfalls,BEHAVIOUR,135,389,410,10.1163/156853998793066177,1998,"Primates are in some ways excellent subjects for studying the impact of predation on prey. They are generally easy to watch and identify as individuals, so that long-term tracking of both death rates and anti-predator behaviors is possible, as amply shown by many of the studies in this volume. On the flip side, their low predation rates and large group sizes require very large total sample sizes for statistically powerful tests of the direct effects of sociality on predation rates. To study the indirect effects of predation on primate behavior requires defining the intrinsic predation risk they experience, that is the expected rate of predation they would suffer under standardized levels of anti-predator. behavior (possibly none - see Hill & Dunbar, this volume). This abstract variable can be assessed qualitatively across different conditions by reference to modeling or common sense, or quantitatively by analyzing the hunting success of the predator independent of the prey's behavior (Cowlishaw, 1997). Great care must be taken in interpreting the behavioral responses of animals to different levels of predation risk when a given behavior can, serve multiple functions, such as is the case with vigilance. Furthermore, most anti-predator behaviors carry fitness costs, not only from the lost opportunity to perform other fitness-enhancing activities, but even in terms of predation itself - apparently some primate species, benefit from living in small grbups which are very difficult for predators to detect instead of using a large-group early-warning defense as postulated in many theoretical models. Such costs will limit the extent to which primates are able to reduce their intrinsic predation risk (Fig. 1).Although comparisons of predation rates or anti-predator behaviors across species or populations may be very revealing, there are some potential problems to contend with. First is the widely-recognized problem of analyzing phylogenetically-structured data (cf: Hill & Dunbar, this volume), which requires robust and detailed phylogenies and requires a long list of assumptions to make the results interpretable statistically (e.g, see Garland et al., 1992). Second, when performing any type of multiple regression to tease apart the confounding effects of correlated variables on the dependent variable, the exact results may depend on the particular set of independent variables examined. Thus, conclusions from such analyses should always be treated as tentative. Finally, predicted ecological responses of prey group size to changing predator density may mimic expected evolutionary changes. Thus, tests of evolutionary predictions with comparative ecological data need to be sensitive to the possibility that the observed differences may not be caused by evolutionary responses and hence may not qualify as adaptations."

Machine learning methods are known as strong tools for data modeling as well as predicting. In this study, we are going to model and predict the future behavior of land subsidence by InSAR processing and leveraging deep learning methods over the lands in the vicinity of Lake Urmia (located in the northwest of Iran). Accordingly, Sentinel-1 data over 56 months from November 2014 to June 2019 and small baseline subsets (SBAS) InSAR methods were utilized. Several regions with a high rate of subsidence were identified (maximum monthly subsidence of 13.3 mm). Furthermore, environmental factors affecting subsidence were considered. Therefore, parameters such as rainfall, groundwater, and lake area variations were measured using TRMM, GRACE, and MODIS satellite data, respectively. In order to determine and assess the relation between land deformations and environmental variations, several machine learning methods were implemented. The environmental parameters were used as the input of models and ground deformations as the target to be predicted. Eventually, ground deformations were estimated using multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, in which each network had strengths and weaknesses on different occasions. Thus, by blending the forecast of the three models, a weighted ensemble was constructed, which outperformed the single models and reached the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation (SD) of 8.2 mm, 6.4 mm, and +/- 5.2 mm, respectively. The result indicated that although each single model had proper accuracy, an ensemble model can improve land deformation anticipation using the strength of networks in various conditions."

However, for many species, we do not have a good understanding of the range of GC concentrations that might indicate a compromised individual. A temporary increase in GC concentration can prompt the adoption of behavior or activities to promote individual survival. However, chronic GC elevation results in deleterious effects on health that can reduce survival. In order to use GC concentration as a metric of individual fitness for a given species, it will be necessary to relate individual demographic rates to GC concentration. We related survival in American pikas (Ochotona princeps) to 2 different stress metrics, glucocorticoid metabolite (GCM) concentration in fecal samples and GC concentration in plasma samples. Annual survival was analyzed in relation to each of these stress metrics as well as other physiological metrics and habitat characteristics at several sites in the Rocky Mountains. Among the predictors considered, GCM concentration was by far the strongest predictor of annual survival in pikas, and individuals with higher baseline GCM were less likely to survive. Our metric of flea load was also negatively related to annual survival. Given the limited time and resources that characterize many wildlife conservation projects, it is important to establish which endocrine metrics are the most informative for a species. American pikas have been identified as a sentinel species for detecting effects of climate change, and several correlational studies have projected range contraction for the species. Our results suggest that more mechanistic projections might be possible given further study of the relationship between GCM and climate. Our approach contributes to a better understanding of factors affecting survival in this species and provides a basis for further research relating individual stress response and survival to environmental change."

Stock status was updated based upon information collected up to spring 2015. Principal sources of information available for the assessment were: a time series of abundance and biomass indices from Canadian winter/spring research vessel (RV) bottom trawl surveys, inshore sentinel surveys, science logbooks from vessels < 35 ft., logbooks from vessels > 35 ft., reported landings from commercial fisheries, oceanographic data, and tagging studies. Total landings for the 2014-15 management year (April 1-March 31) were 7,166 t or just 54% of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC), and this marks the sixth consecutive season that the TAC has not been fully taken. The 2015-16 fishery was still in progress at the time of the meeting. The removals through recreational fishing are unknown since 2007, but based on previous estimates are thought to be a small fraction ([approximately] 1%) of the commercial landings. Estimates of abundance and biomass from the DFO RV spring survey have been relatively stable over the past seven years (except for a high value in 2013 apparently influenced by a year-effect), with abundance being slightly higher than it was in the early 2000s and biomass being generally lower than it was in the early 2000s. The 2015 survey was dominated by young fish which are not yet of commercial size. Sentinel gillnet catch rates have been very low and stable since 1999. Sentinel linetrawl catch rates have been below average for the past six years and the 2014 catch rate was the lowest in the time series. Gillnet catch rates from logbooks of vessels < 35 ft. have been generally stable since 1999 but increasing to slightly above average in 2014. Linetrawl catch-rates decreased over 2006-10, but subsequently increased and are presently at the time-series average. Estimates of Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) derived from a survey-based (SURBA) cohort model increased considerably over 2009-12 but have since declined. The 2014 and 2015 estimates are approximately 1.4 times higher than the limit reference point (LRP), and the stock is currently in the 'cautious zone' according to DFO's Precautionary Approach (PA) Framework.. The probability of being below the LRP in 2015 is low ([approximately]0.05). Recruitment has improved over the last decade with most cohorts at or above the time-series (1983-2014) average. In particular, indications are that the 2011 and 2012 cohorts are strong. Estimated total mortality has generally been increasing since 1997 to near the time-series maximum. Over 2012-14, it averaged 0.65 (48% annual mortality), which is high especially considering that reported landings have been about half of the TACs over this time period. Projection of the stock to 2016 was conducted assuming mortality rates will be within [plus or minus]20% of current values (2012-14 average). Projection scenarios indicate that the 2016 SSB will increase from the 2015 estimate, with median 2016 relative SSB projections ranging from 1.7 to 2.1. In each of the scenarios, the probability of being below the LRP in 2016 is low (<= 0.05). Despite short-term projections for stock growth, there is reason for concern for 3Ps cod going forward. Although recruitment has recently been good, mortality is very high and hence the long-term contribution of these year classes to the fishery and spawning biomass is still uncertain. The spawning biomass is composed almost entirely of young fish, with the current age at maturity being the lowest recorded in the time series. Recent biological data suggest fish growth rates are low and that fish condition is poor. In recent years, cod in 3Ps have been feeding heavily on lipid-poor prey such as snow crab and other invertebrates. The combination of these biological data with the recent rise of warm-water species such as white hake is suggestive of broad changes in the 3Ps ecosystem and perhaps reduced cod productivity."

The nonoverlapping, three-dimensional territories in the canopy had a ground size up to 0.8 ha. C. gigas showed a distinct territorial behavior: (1) specific barrack nests, especially containing many majors, were situated at the borders and were established during long-term territorial conflicts; (2) trunk trails were regularly patrolled by majors that attacked alien conspecifics and some other ant species violently; and (3) sentinels, often involved in long-enduring conflicts with neighboring ant colonies, defended the borders at bridgeheads. Interspecific conflicts with sympatric Camponotus, species always led to violent, bloody fights of all castes. Intraspecific conflicts, however, were solved by ritual fights (front leg boxing) of majors. C gigas performed a de-escalation strategy to end short periods of true intraspecific ant war that we provoked experimentally. Artificially induced ritualized combats continued over weeks also in the absence of baits, indicating that borders may become established by long-term conflicts of attrition. We discuss the differences between ritual fights in desert and rainforest ants and apply Lanchester's theory of battles to our findings."

This situation commonly occurs with island biota, and is similar to moving from the dangerous inner-city to the suburbs. Economic thinking tells us that we should expect costly antipredator behaviour to be lost if it is no longer beneficial. The loss of antipredator behaviour has important consequences for those seeking to translocate or reintroduce individuals from predator-free islands back to the predator-rich mainland, but we have neither a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of loss nor information on the time course of relaxed selection. Some antipredator behaviours are experience-dependent: experience with predators is required for their proper performance. In these cases, antipredator behaviour is lost after only a single generation of isolation, but it should be able to be regained following exposure to predators. Other behaviours may be more 'hard-wired'. The evolutionary loss of antipredator behaviour may occur over as few as several generations, but behaviours may also persist for many thousands of years of predator-free living.Location Australia and New Zealand.Methods I discuss the results of a series of studies designed to document the mechanisms and time course of relaxed selection for antipredator behaviour in macropodid marsupials. Controlled studies of visual, acoustic and olfactory predator recognition, as well as field studies of antipredator vigilance focused on several species of kangaroos and wallabies.Results Visual predator recognition may be retained following 9500 years of relaxed selection, but olfactory and acoustic predator recognition may have to be learned. Insular populations allow humans to approach closer before fleeing than mainland animals. Insular species may retain 'group size effects' - the ability to seek safety in numbers - when they are exposed to any predators.Main conclusions I suggest that the presence of any predators may be an important factor in maintaining functional antipredator behaviour. Managers should pay particular attention as to the source and evolutionary history of their population when planning translocations or reintroductions."

We surveyed flocks in Central Spain during two winters. Flocks in fragments comprised fewer individuals and species than flocks in unfragmented forests. The most abundant species in forest flocks (blue tit, Parus caeruleus, and firecrest, Regulus ignicapillus) were also the most abundant in fragments, while the rarest species in the area never occurred in small woodlots. We investigated how fragmentation and related changes in flock structure affect anti-predator behaviour of blue tits, a widely distributed species in the area. In fragments but not in forests, blue tits increased scanning rates with decreasing flock size. Vigilance was relaxed when great tits, Parus major, were abundant as flock mates, suggesting that the absence of this dominant species in fragments could intensify anti-predator behaviour of blue tits. Blue tits enhanced anti-predator behaviour in the second winter parallel to an increase in the abundance of raptors. This behavioural change was stronger in fragments, where blue tits foraged deeper in the canopy and increased scanning and hopping rates. Under increased predation risk, birds are expected to reduce body mass to improve predator avoidance. On average, blue tits weighed similar in fragments and forests the second winter. However, they accumulated fat along the day in-fragments only, and adjusted body mass to body size more closely in that habitat type. This suggests that blue tits perceived fragments as unpredictable habitats where fattening would help avoid starvation, but also as dangerous sites where overweight would further increase the risk of predation. In summary, our results. support that fragmentation affects individual behaviour of blue tits, and show the potential of behavioural approaches to unravel how different species face the advancing fragmentation of their habitats."
ESTRADA A; ESTRADA R,ESTABLISHMENT OF A FREE RANGING COLONY OF STUMP-TAILED MACAQUES MACACA-ARCTOIDES RELATIONS TO THE ECOLOGY PART 1,Primates,17,337,355,10.1007/BF02382790,1976,"A group of 20 stumptail macaques was released free on the island of Totogochillo in lake Catemaco, Veracruz, Mexico, on Aug. 15, 1974. Initial adaptations to the island geography and ecology are reported for the first 83 days of observation. The island of Totogochillo is a lava formed island with vegetation type consisting of secondary tropical rain forest. The stumptail group composition consisted of 1 adult male, 5 adult female and 14 non adult individuals. Individuals and matrilineal genealogies are identifiable. Home range is limited by the island's size. The macaques only have 1 sleeping site. The use of resting areas seems to be related to variations in the travelling and foraging patterns of the stumptails. Five travelling routes were identified and changes in these are associated with changes in the availability and distribution of natural edibles. Feeding adaptations consist of consumption of vegetal matter such as leaves, seeds, roots, flowers and tree bark. Of 65 major plant species identified, the stumptails consume 28% (N:18). Sex differences in foods eaten were not observed but age differences do exist. The macaques prey on crickets, spiders, birds and water snails. Food pressure is suggested to induce the monkeys to locate new food resources. Predators on the island are not existent but avian predators are present in the area. The stumptails respond to their presence with alarm calls and an attack by a hawk on the group was witnessed. Sentinel behavior was performed by an adult female while protecting and scouting was carried out by the adult male. During the course of the study 4 deaths occurred, 2 infants were born and on Nov. 7th, 12 more stumptails were released on the island. Continuing research consists of studies of the ontogeny of social relations and of the sexual behavior in the stumptail group against a background of known social structural relations and kinship ties."

As upper trophic species, baleen whales can serve as sentinels of ecosystem reorganization in response to these biophysical alterations, via changes in their ecology and physiological condition. This paper is the first to review baleen whale ecology in high-latitude marine ecosystems of both the north Atlantic and north Pacific. Oceanographically, these sectors offer four contrasting habitats to baleen whales: (i) a broad-deep-strait and deep-shelf inflow system in the Northeast Atlantic (NEA), (ii) a combination of inflow and outflow systems north of Iceland in the central North Atlantic (CNA), (iii) an outflow shelf and basin in the Northwest Atlantic (NWA), and (iv) a narrow-shallow-strait inflow shelf system in the Pacific sector. Information on baleen whale ecology from visual and passive acoustic surveys, combined with available telemetry and diet studies, show contrasting patterns of baleen whale occurrence among sectors. In brief, arctic and subarctic waters in the Atlantic sector support a far greater number of seasonally-migrant baleen whales than the Pacific sector. Thousands of humpback, fin and common minke whales occupy the diverse habitats of the Atlantic sector. These species all exhibit flexible diets, focused primarily on euphausiids (krill) and forage fishes (e.g., capelin, herring, sand lance), which are now responding to ecosystems altered by climate change. Conversely, the Pacific sector supports a far greater number of arctic-endemic bowhead whales than the Atlantic sector, as well as a large population of seasonally-migrant gray whales. Currently, differences in migratory timing and, to a lesser extent, foraging behaviors, serves to restrict prey competition between the arctic-endemic bowhead whale and seasonally migrant baleen whale species in both sectors. Regional aspects of changes in prey type and availability will likely impact future migratory timing, habitat selection, body condition and diet of baleen whales. Tracking variability in these attributes can provide valuable input to ecosystem models and thereby contribute the sentinel capability of baleen whales to forecasts of future states of high latitude marine ecosystems."

In combination with other kairomones such as caproic acid, lactic acid and ammonia doses of 2-undecanone from 4 ppm up to 130 ppm augmented significantly the attractiveness of these kairomones. The synergism of 2-undecanone with other attractants is comparable to that one described for lactic acid. The combination of 2- undecanone with lactic acid, however, was more attractive than the two compounds as single stimuli. Interestingly 2-undecanone is neither known as an human skin compound nor as a volatile in human breath. First field experiments near Regensburg in Germany with BG-Sentinel[registered trademark] mosquito traps could not confirm the attractive effect of 2-undecanone (ROSE et al. 2006) for Culex species. A possible explanation could be that the tested dose of 2-undecanone was not in the optimum range or that the studied species do not respond to this compound."

The larvae of Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are the most frequently observed predators of H. zea eggs in sweet corn. Companion cropping strategies have been developed to augment densities of C. maculata in sweet corn plantings. In this study, the importance of predation by C. maculata larvae was evaluated in experiments when larval abundance was manipulated using hand removal and physical exclusion. In 2003 and 2004, sentinel H. zea eggs were exposed on corn for 48 h. Egg mortality was 13.8% greater in the treatment where C. maculata larvae were present. In 2004 and 2005 eggs were exposed on corn under the same hand removal and physical exclusion techniques and monitored at 3-h intervals for 24 h to directly observe predation on sentinel eggs. Coleomegilla maculata larvae were the most frequently observed predators of the eggs, accounting for 45.9% of 85 total observed predation events in the control. Whereas in the treatment where C. maculata larvae were reduced, egg survival was 26.13% greater and only 37 total predation events were observed. All pest eggs were eliminated from individual ears 22.1% more often when C. maculata larvae were present at natural densities indicating that predation by this predator stage lessens crop damage by H. zea. The results of this study suggest that C. maculata larvae are an irreplaceable source of natural mortality for H. zea eggs on sweet corn."

Due to the climate changes and industrial development, soil resources in these zones are prone to degradation. On the other hand, degradation processes cause changes in land cover. Remote sensing optical data are widely used in the process of determining land cover change whereas SAR data is suitable for determination of soil moisture dynamics. In the present study, Tasseled Cap Transform (TCT) and modified Change Vector Analysis (mCVA) techniques are applied to Landsat and Sentinel 2 data in order to be determined magnitude and direction of land cover changes in the semi-natural areas of Haskovo Region, Southeast Bulgaria. The study of the vector direction presents some distinct changes in the soil characteristics for the whole territory and significant changes in vegetation characteristics and moisture content in part of the semi-mountainous territories of the examined region. It has been found that the magnitude of those changes increases up to 50% in some of the territories under investigation. SAR data has been used to evaluate the relative soil moisture content in various soil differences and to trace its dynamics during growing season. In order to achieve this aim, Relative Soil Moisture Index (RSMI) is used. The index estimates the relative variation of volumetric soil moisture content in a given time period and enables determination of its change in relative values.

The increase of long-term drought periods and the trend towards low summer precipitation totals trigger an increase in groundwater scarcity and amplify the negative effects of extensive irrigation purposes and freshwater consumption in a hydrologically sensitive region in Central Europe. This article presents qualitative transnational open source remote sensing temporal series of vegetation indices (NDVI) and groundwater level development to tracing near real-time vegetation change and socio-ecological feedbacks during periods of climate extremes in the Upper Rhine Area (2018-2020). Increased freshwater consumption caused a dramatic drop in groundwater availability, which eventually led to a strong degradation of the vegetation canopy and caused governmental regulations in July 2020. Assessing vegetation growth behavior and linking groundwater reactions in the URA through open source satellite data contributes to a rapidly accessible understanding of the ecosystem's feedbacks on the local to the transnational scale and further enables risk management and eco-political regulations in current and future decision-making processes."

However, little is known about whether individuals also acquire such information from non-members of their own group. We experimentally manipulated the perceived threat and heterospecific cues about low predation risk in the house sparrow, Passer domesticus, by presenting stuffed dummies of the Eurasian sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, and the Eurasian tree sparrow, Passer montanus, at the feeder. Data were collected during winter 2016/2017 in two private yards in south-west and north Slovakia, where 1677 individuals in 83 flocks were observed at two feeders. We found no evidence for heterospecific information use in foraging single-species flocks of house sparrows. We suggest that strong bonds created among flock members may explain the observed pattern."

The birds' activities, recorded by flock-scans made at regular intervals throughout the day, were compared for days with and without Supplementary food. The main activities recorded were feeding and loafing in both circumstances, but the proportion of time that the birds spent feeding was significantly lower on days when food was provided (43%) than on days when they grazed on the town's lawns without any additional food (67%). Conversely, the amount of time that the birds spent loafing was higher on days when fed by the public (25%) than on days when they were not (14%). The difference in diurnal patterns was most evident from 13:00 h onwards, which coincided with the increase in the provision of food in the second half of the days When supplementary food was available, vigilance behaviour also doubled from 8% to 16%, and more social interactions (mainly agonistic behaviour) and locomotion were observed."

Frequency with which the birds returned with food to the nest and the time spent at the feeding patch was recorded. The time per visit increased with increasing distance. But the time spent feeding per unit area was negatively correlated with distance. The starlings fed longer when alone than when feeding in a group. They feed more effectively in a group because there is less need for vigilance. The abundance of food, measured as the density of earthworms, was higher when the starlings started to feed than later and also higher on a more distant than a closer patch at the start of feeding. Distance from the nest is an important factor in central place foraging in birds."

Predation risk varies with animal behavior and environmental conditions, yet attempts to understand predation risk in natural systems often ignore important ecological and environmental complexities, relying instead on proxies for actual risk such as predator-prey spatial overlap. Here we detail the ecological and environmental complexities driving disconnects between three stages of the predation sequence that are often assumed to be tightly linked: spatial overlap, encounters and prey capture. Our review highlights several major sources of variability in natural predator-prey systems that lead to the decoupling of spatial overlap estimates from actual encounter rates (e.g. temporal activity patterns, predator and prey movement capacity, resource limitations) and that affect the probability of prey capture given encounter (e.g. predator hunger levels, temporal, topographic and other environmental influences on capture success). Emerging technologies and statistical methods are facilitating a transition to a more spatiotemporally detailed, mechanistic understanding of predator-prey interactions, allowing for the concurrent examination of multiple stages of the predation sequence in mobile, free-ranging animals. We describe crucial applications of this new understanding to fundamental and applied ecology, highlighting opportunities to better integrate ecological contingencies into dynamic predator-prey models and to harness a mechanistic understanding of predator-prey interactions to improve targeting and effectiveness of conservation interventions."

The experiment relies on a between-subjects design in which a target group of subjects are exposed to trust-building strategies while another control group of subjects are not. We apply this paradigm to corporate discourse in the form of an About Us webpage produced by a fictitious multinational pharmaceutical company that has been accused by a whistle-blower of corporate misconduct. The results of the study show that these strategies are indeed effective in fostering trust in the company and have an indirect positive effect on the perceived credibility of the company's denial in response to the allegations made by the whistle-blower. The strategies are therefore able to mitigate the potential damage caused by public accusations of wrongdoing and help companies insure against future threats to their legitimacy and freedom to operate, as when their behaviour violates, or is said to violate, societal norms and values. Theoretically, the results provide insights into the psychological mechanisms of trust-building and reader response. Methodologically, the study contributes to the growing body of work using experimental methods in Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) by further demonstrating that experimentation can usefully complement more traditional discourse-analytical methods as a form of triangulation."
"WIEPKEMA, PR; KOOLHAAS, JM",STRESS AND ANIMAL-WELFARE,ANIMAL WELFARE,2,195,218,,1993,"When individual vertebrates loose grip on their life conditions stress symptoms appear and their welfare becomes problematic. Present day research supports the view that stress can originate when an organism experiences a substantial reduction of predictability and/or controllability (P/C) of relevant events. Behavioural (conflict and disturbed behaviour) and physiological (neuro-endocrine and autonomic processes) aspects of a reduction of P/C are reviewed. The highly dynamic patterns of the homeostatic mechanisms activated during stress make it difficult to deduce any simple relationship between stress and welfare. Nevertheless the following conclusions are drawn and defended: moderate stress may be necessary to optimize vigilance both the occurrence of one dramatic life event and a long lasting low P/C of relevant life conditions may lead to chronic stress symptoms with a pathological character the coherence of pre- and post-pathological symptoms is decisive for an evaluation of individual welfare.A list of relevant stress symptoms has been presented, all of which indicate some stage of serious welfare problems. Their occurrence should never be typical of animals living in a farm, laboratory or zoo housing system. However if after all this is the case such systems have to be corrected and replaced hy more appropriate ones as soon as possible."
DU TOIT J T,FEEDING-HEIGHT STRATIFICATION AMONG AFRICAN BROWSING RUMINANTS,African Journal of Ecology,28,55,62,,1990,"This study investigated the hypothesis that the use of different feeding levels in the vegetation promotes resource partitioning among browsing ungulate species in African savannas. Focal animal feeding observations, recorded on a real-time basis using a computerized data-capture system, were conducted on giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis Linnaeus), kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros Pallas), impala (Aepyceros melampus Lichtenstein) and steenbok (Raphicerus campestris Thunberg) in the central region of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Although there was clear stratification in mean feeding heights among the four species throughout the seasonal cycle, there was considerable overlap in the feeding-height ranges of kudu, impala and steenbok. Hence, feeding-height stratification probably only separates giraffe from the other species. Giraffe bulls fed at a higher level in the vegetation than cows, often with head and neck extended vertically. It is suggested that bulls benefit in this by gaining access to nutritious new shoots in the upper canopy, but may suffer an increased predation cost due to reduced vigilance when in this posture."

Negative effects upon staff and organizations have been established, yet few detailed explanations are offered for this aggression, and none represents the patient's perspective. This paper presents a model from the patient's perspective that takes account of situational variables, while also focusing upon patient cognitions. It also considers physiological responses related to arousal that might underpin aggression in an anxiety-provoking situation. In a previous study the frequency with which aggression was preceded by some anxiety-provoking event and the extent to which assailants displayed diminished cognitive processing were established; these were incorporated into the model. Increased anxiety commonly experienced by patients can have a negative effect upon cognitive processing. Anxiety generates a hyper-vigilance for threatening stimuli, induces selective attentional bias for threat, and causes a narrowing of attention, thus reducing cues and information upon which to make accurate appraisals and attributions. With such impairments, patients may make negative rather than positive attributions regarding actions of staff, which are frequently anxiety provoking. Thus, patients perceive staff behaviour as threatening rather than benign, and in the absence of positive attributions it will invoke an aggressive response. What health care staff perceive as aggression may be seen by patients as a defence against perceived attack. Changes in policy that take this into account may reduce future aggressive incidents."
"Poon, Kean",Evaluating dual-process theory of decision-making in Chinese delinquent adolescents,AUSTRALIAN PSYCHOLOGIST,55,257,268,10.1111/ap.12417,2020,"Objective Dual-process theories have dominated the study of crime research and risk perception over the last two decades. However, no study to date has examined these combined approaches in research into delinquent youths. The current study aimed to address this issue by comparing cognitive and affective processes between Chinese delinquent and non-delinquent adolescents, and investigated whether variables of the two processes were correlated with each other and whether they predicted delinquent behaviours. Method Delinquent adolescents (n = 122, M-age = 15.3 years, SD = 1.2, 62 males, 60 females) were recruited from juvenile institutions, while typically developing controls (n = 129, M-age = 15.2 years, SD = 1.7, 59 males, 70 females) were recruited from local schools; all participants completed a cognitive appraisal questionnaire and a computerised gambling task. Teacher reports on delinquent behaviour were also collected. Results In cognitive decision-making, delinquent adolescents perceived more benefits, less risks, and a higher anticipated involvement in relation to risky events than non-delinquent adolescents. In affective decision-making, the delinquent group exhibited higher risk-taking and poorer vigilance in risk modulation than the non-delinquent group. Delinquent adolescents were also less likely to bet on the advantageous choice than their non-delinquent counterparts. Conclusions The current study provides a more encompassing picture of the divergent decision-making pathways associated with delinquent groups, allowing for better prevention and intervention programs that combine cognitive and behavioural components."

Variation in the importance and quality of social relationships should influence the way individuals selectively attend to fellow group members. Preliminary data on visual monitoring of conspecifics by wild female mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) show that selective attention mirrors variation in social relationships. Social bonds between males and females are central to gorilla society; correspondingly, females are more likely to stop feeding and focus their attention on males who walk into view than on females, especially when males give displays. Females are more likely to focus on other females with whom they have antagonistic relationships than those (mostly close relatives) with whom they have affiliative, cooperative ones. Further research on the context and consequences of visual monitoring could help to address questions about the regulation of social relationships and about social cognition in gorillas."

We present findings on the behavioral consequences of introductions as a function of age, sex, and residency status and long-term consequences for health and reproduction. No morbidity from aggression occurred at the time of introductions or during several months following and reproduction was not compromised. Activity budgets and patterns of social spacing and interaction were little changed following the introductions except for increases in vigilance behavior, especially by newly introduced adult females. Adult females exhibited the strongest and longest-lasting response to changes in group composition. The results indicate that in this species (1) introductions of adult females can be carried out with acceptable risk to the newcomers provided that careful monitoring occurs, so that the onset of severe aggression instigated by resident females toward new females can be avoided, (2) juveniles can be introduced with minimal risk, and (3) adult males can be introduced into groups lacking resident adult males with minimal risk. Capuchins differ in important ways from the better-studied Old World monkeys in their response to introductions of strangers. The differences are instructive with regard to processes supporting species-typical social structure, which is less overtly hierarchical in capuchins than in macaques."

So, to make emotional computers and make the human-computer interaction (HCI) more naturally and friendly, computers should be able to understand human feelings using speech and visual information. In this paper, we recognize the emotions from audio and visual information using fuzzy ARTMAP neural network (FAMNN). Audio and visual systems fuse at decision and feature levels. Finally, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to determine the optimum values of the choice parameter (alpha), the vigilance parameters (rho), and the learning rate (beta) of the FAMNN. Experimental results showed that the feature-level and decision-level fusions improve the outcome of unimodal systems. Also PSO improved the recognition rate. By using the PSO-optimized FAMNN at feature level fusion, the recognition rate was improved by about 57 % with respect to the audio system and by about 4.5 % with respect to the visual system. The final emotion recognition rate on the SAVEE database was reached to 98.25 % using audio and visual features by using optimized FAMNN."

In North America, foraging studies largely focused on the population level with an emphasis on foraging energetics aimed at improving waterfowl production through increased carrying capacity of wetlands in breeding areas, an approach later expanded to nonbreeding grounds. In Europe, studies have instead focused on inter-individual differences in behavior of foraging ducks, with an emphasis on individual efficiency (e.g., methods, intake rate, patch choice) within the framework of optimal foraging theory. We suggest that agent-based models (also termed individual-based behavior models), which aim to predict habitat use from the heterogeneous behavior of different individual agents, can help to unify these approaches and would benefit considerably from increased collaboration and integration of the approaches of both North American and European researchers.

Using the anomalies of temperature and precipitation derived from Ny Alesund meteorological station, it is observed that the ELA for most of the glaciers shifted to a higher altitude during 2016-2018 when the temperature was slightly high as compared to the long term mean, while it shifted down the glacier due to heavy accumulation and low temperature during 2019-20. The maximum shift of +/- 25 (with an uncertainty of +/- 6.85 m arising out of remote sensing data) in ELA, was detected during 2016-2020.

The alert, flight initiation and escape distances were 1.6, 2.5 and 2.3 times longer, respectively, when Svalbard reindeer were encountered by a person disguised as a polar bear compared to a person in dark hiking gear. Population increase of polar bears on Svalbard and decrease in sea-ice cover in the Arctic region during summer probably results in more frequent interactions with reindeer on the archipelago. Similar reindeer response behavior from encounters with a polar bear and persons disguised as polar bears indicate a predator-prey relationship between the two species on Edgeoya."

Recent research suggests that yawning may support effective changes in mental state or vigilance through cerebral cooling. To further investigate the relationship between yawning, state change, and thermoregulation, 12 Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) were exposed to a total of 2 h of ambient temperature manipulation over a period of 48 h. Using a repeated measures design, each rat experienced a range of increasing (22 degrees C -> 32 degrees C), decreasing (32 degrees C -> 22 degrees C), and constant temperatures (22 degrees C; 32 degrees C). Yawning and locomotor activity occurred most frequently during initial changes in temperature, irrespective of direction, compared to more extended periods of temperature manipulation. The rate of yawning also diminished during constant high temperatures (32 degrees C) compared to low temperatures (22 degrees C). Unlike yawning, however, stretching was unaffected by ambient temperature variation. These findings are compared to recent work on budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), and the ecological selective pressures for yawning in challenging thermal environments are discussed. The results support previous comparative research connecting yawning with arousal and state change, and contribute to refining the predictions of the thermoregulatory hypothesis across vertebrates."

We found that the rate of pecking at seeds by jays was affected by available seed type and the presence and activity of nearby conspecifics. Jays at an artificial feeding platform seemed to pay attention to other individuals, in that they pecked at a lower rate when another jay was nearby, except when the other jay was feeding at a different platform. The decreased feeding rate when two jays shared the same feeding platform is contrary to the widely reported pattern of increased feeding and decreased scanning correlated with increased group size in various species. Our analysis suggests that this pattern of behavior fits with observations that Steller's jays show site-specific dominance, mutual interference at a concentrated food source, and do not live in structured flocks with consistent membership."

Whilst we make several decisions on a daily basis, firefighters in particular are called to make important decisions in a split second and within life-threatening settings. Stress can therefore impact their ability to perform and carry out their job. The implications of stress are similarly important in other settings requiring high-vigilance. In this paper, we aim to contribute to efforts to better train firefighters in decision making in stressful situations through a serious game solution. The game was designed based on the Stress Exposure Training (SET) approach and in accordance with typical stressors identified in the literature. Those were then mapped to relevant game mechanics. The evaluation of the resulting game was twofold: A. to assess its ability to increase participants' stress level, and B. to investigate whether decision making performance would be improved for participants under stress. The proposed framework and the prototype were evaluated through empirical research that consisted of the participants' self-reported stress levels using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI) and the participants' physiological measurements, namely galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate (HR). Our results demonstrate the potential of serious games to assist towards training of firefighters to make better decisions under stressful situations. Our findings are of wider importance as they contribute to ongoing efforts to improve decision making under stress in a variety of settings and scenarios."

The present study aimed to investigate neural changes related to the mentalistic description of the proposer in the UG task. For this purpose, 21 healthy adults played the LIG task for real during a functional MRI session. According with previous evidence, we considered the responder's behavior to unfair offers in an UG paradigm, in which proposers were described as generous, selfish and neutral. Our results showed that the mentalistic labels significantly influence the acceptance rate: however, no significant differences emerged with respect to the response time. At the neural level, we observed activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in the theory of mind network. The mentalistic labels did not result in changes of the neural network activated in the unfair condition during the UG task, except for the level of activation within the cingulate cortex. Particularly, the most incoherent situation where a generous proposer made an unfair offer was associated with a greater activation of the posterior cingulate cortex, an area involved in maintaining a state of vigilance and attention. These results support the idea that the posterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are coinvolved when dealing with incoherent situations due to different mentalistic features of the proposer in the UG task."

We examined escape behaviour (flight initiation distance, distance fled to shelter) of the crab Leptograpsus variegatus, relative to shelter size and distribution on a shoreline with multiple shelters and on a shoreline with limited shelter. Larger crabs tended to be nearer to larger shelters than smaller crabs and fled sooner and further than smaller crabs. Larger crabs often fled past the nearest shelters if they were too small. Group size increased at the site with fewer shelters, but this did not influence flight behaviour. We conclude that the availability of shelters and body size influences escape behaviour of these crabs."
"Pelletier, F.",Effects of tourist activities on ungulate behaviour in a mountain protected area.,Ibex Journal of Mountain Ecology,8,15,19,,2006,"Many protected areas seek to both preserve biodiversity and promote recreational activities. These objectives, however, may conflict if human activities reduce animal use of protected habitat. To determine if traffic volume affected the area-use pattern of wild ungulates, I conducted ungulate surveys along a road in the Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta, over two years. I counted groups of four ungulate species, and compared the number seen during weekdays (low traffic volume) and weekends (high volume). Fewer groups of all three cervid species were seen during weekends than during weekdays, while no difference was observed for bighorn sheep. Bighorn sheep, however, flew at the sight of or when chased by domestic dogs. High traffic volume decreased ungulate use of habitat areas within sight of the road. Anthropogenic disturbance therefore led to habitat loss in this protected area because during days with heavy traffic, ungulates avoided habitat close to the road. Moreover, harassment by domestic dogs artificially increases the predation risk perceived by ungulates, which is likely to increase vigilance, decrease foraging time and cause bighorn sheep to spend more time in escape terrain."
"Kingsford, R. T.",Biparental care of the Australian Wood Chenonetta jubata,Wildfowl,41,83,91,,1990,"Australian Wood Ducks are unusual among ducks in having extended biparental care. Males and females were equally likely to lead ducklings away from danger or to attack conspecifics or potential avian predators. Pairs that were laying, incubating or attending young, performed more Extreme head up behaviour than other paired birds. In family groups, differences in vigilant behaviour existed between the sexes. Males performed more Extreme head up and stood on higher ground more than females, who stayed closer to the brood. Male Extreme head up was highest when females were laying or incubating and declined with age of the ducklings. In contrast female vigilance was lowest during laying and incubation, and increased with duckling age. During laying, incubation and early brood care, much of female activity away from the nest site was grazing. Females probably grazed intensely during brood care to recover energy lost during incubation and laying. As small grazing birds, the risks of predation are probably high. To overcome this, males attend the brood, which probably increases duckling survival."

However, much of what is known about the effects of group size on behavioral ecology has come from comparisons across multiple groups of different sizes. These findings may be biased because behavioral differences across groups may be more indicative of how environmental variation influences animal behavior, rather than group size itself. To partially circumvent this limitation, we used longitudinal data to examine how changes in group size across time affect the behavior of folivorous red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus) of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Controlling for food availability, we demonstrated that increasing group size resulted in altered activity budgets, based on 6 yr of data on a group that increased from 57 to 98 members. Specifically, as group size increased, individuals spent less time feeding and socializing, more time traveling, and increased the diversity of their diet. These changes appear to allow the monkeys to compensate for greater scramble competition apparent at larger group sizes, as increasing group size did not show the predicted relationship with lower female fecundity. Our results support recent findings documenting feeding competition in folivorous primates. Our results also document behavioral flexibility, an important trait that allows many social mammals to maximize the benefits of sociality (e.g., increased vigilance), while minimizing the costs (e.g., increased feeding competition)."

Traditionally, large intraspecific group size is thought to accrue individuals with fitness benefits from increased predator vigilance and hence lower predation risk. To date, few studies have investigated interspecific group size in relation to predation risk. In the present study, we examined predation outcome in Darwin's small tree finch, Camarhynchus parvulus, in nests with many or few interspecific neighbours. We tested the predictions: (1) nests in mixed associations have lower predation than do more solitary nests; (2) mixed species nesting associations covary with nest site vegetation characteristics; (3) older (i.e. presumably experienced) males more commonly nest in mixed associations than younger males; (4) older males select more concealed nesting sites; and (5) controlling male age, females prefer to pair with males in mixed associations than at solitary nests. Almost half of all nests occurred in mixed associations (46%) compared to solitary nests (54%), and the overall distribution of nests was decidedly nonrandom, displaying a bimodal pattern. Nest site vegetation characteristics of the focal species were inconsistently associated with nesting pattern, but older males did select more concealed nesting sites. Controlling differences in surrounding vegetation characteristics, mixed nesting associations experienced markedly lower predation than solitary nests, and females showed a preference for males in mixed associations, as demonstrated by higher male pairing success.

Individual female wasps were offered different densities of host eggs for 16 h at 17, 20, and 27 degrees C. Field experiments were carried out in a sweet corn field that was divided into 6 plots of equal size (120 m(2)). Sentinel European corn borer egg masses were exposed to wasps for 3 d, from day 0 to 3 and day 4 to 7 after releasing wasps. Both the laboratory study and field experiments indicated that egg parasitism was positively correlated with egg density. However, this relationship differed significantly for the 3 temperatures in the laboratory study and varied considerably for the different days of exposures (days 0-3 versus days 4-7) and for different replicates (time of the year). The Gompertz equation and a modified disc equation were fitted to the laboratory data categorized based on temperatures. The results showed that female T. ostriniae might exhibit the type II or type III functional response depending on temperature. The field data suggested a type II functional response when data were pooled for all replicates."

Eucalyptus is the most common exotic species in Portugal forests. This species is fundamental in the industries related to the pulp paper production and the concern about their effects in ecosystems is growing. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) combined with Remote Sensing (RS) data can help to understand this complex ecosystem. Moreover, GIS and RS are commonly used in forest management. GIS allows the manipulation, analysis, and generation of considerable amounts of environmental information. This information can be used in the evaluation of ecosystems' conditions and for decision making. The study case of this project was the municipal lands included in Serras do Porto and Valongo's Nature 2000 network (Porto district, Portugal). The study zone considered in this work is a landscape of extreme relevance to Porto Metropolitan Area. For decades this area was extensively explored with eucalyptus plantations in order to produce cellulose for paper industry. Due to the characteristics of the area and its extension (40 hectares) the use of GIS became the most accurate and reliable alternative to characterize it. The combination of GIS tools and RS data allows the characterization of terrain relief, namely the analysis of altimetry, hypsometry, hydrography, the creation of environmental indexes such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). RS technology offer the potential to explore the effects of land-use changes and disturbances on forest dynamics at large spatial scales. A Sentinel-2A image was used to produce NDVI, EVI, and NDWI environmental indexes and to generate the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) map, through Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin from QGIS software using Minimum Distance algorithm. The LULC was classified with two classes because the study area only presents two types of species: eucalyptus and bare soil. The LULC map obtained was validated through field points collected in the study area with a GPS receptor. An overall accuracy of 92.98% and a kappa statistic of 0.842 was obtained. Also, some of the geographic information obtained in the field was then integrated in QGIS software. Moreover, a phenological study was performed using NDVI values obtained from Sentinel-2A images, to understand the eucalyptus behavior in a certain period of time.. Because of that RS data provided useful information about the landscape dynamics allowing the assess to forest cover change and land use helping to create decision making plans and forest conservation measures."

This information was used to test several hypotheses regarding ultimate causes of sleeping site use in this primate. White-headed langurs slept either in caves (17 sites) or on a cliff ledge (one site). They used all sleeping sites repeatedly, and reused some of them on consecutive nights; three nights was the longest consecutive use of any one sleep site. We suggest that langurs use sleeping sites to make approach and attack by predators difficult, and to increase their own familiarity with a location so as to improve chances for escape. Langurs' cryptic behaviors with an increased level of vigilance before entering sleeping sites may also help in decreasing the possibility of detection by predators. Group 1 spent more sleeping nights in the central area of their territory than expected; in contrast, group 2 spent more sleeping nights in the periphery of their territory, which overlaps with that of another groups, than expected. The position of sleeping site relative to the last feeding site of the day and the first feeding site of the subsequent morning indicated a strategy closer to that of a multiple central place forager than of a central place forager. These results suggest that territory defense and food access may play an important role in sleeping site use of white-headed langurs [Current Zoology 57 (3): 260-268, 2011]."

This study presents a novel system which applies convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically learn and predict pre-defined driving postures. The main idea is to monitor driver hand position with discriminative information extracted to predict safe/unsafe driving posture. In comparison to previous approaches, CNNs can automatically learn discriminative features directly from raw images. In the authors' works, a CNNmodel was first pre-trained by an unsupervised feature learning method called sparse filtering, and subsequently fine-tuned with classification. The approach was verified using the Southeast University driving posture dataset, which comprised of video clips covering four driving postures, including normal driving, responding to a cell phone call, eating, and smoking. Compared with other popular approaches with different image descriptors and classification methods, the authors' scheme achieves the best performance with an overall accuracy of 99.78%. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalisation performance in more realistic conditions, the method was further tested using other two specially designed datasets which takes into account of the poor illuminations and different road conditions, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.3 and 95.77%, respectively."

To test this hypothesis, we estimated diet composition for red deer in the Scottish highlands in spring, when recreational activity tends to be high, and in winter when it is lower. We analysed faecal samples from three habitat types (grassland, heather moorland and woodland) collected at sites close to a busy track (disturbed) and at a distance from it (less disturbed). The diet consisted of 39% grasses, sedges, herbs and rushes (GSHR) and 58% Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp. (heather) in spring, compared with 14% grasses and 77% heather in winter, with small quantities of Vaccinium spp. (berry) and Pinus sylvestris (tree) in both seasons. In spring, faeces from disturbed grass and woodland sites indicated a diet with less GSHR and more heather and tree than faeces from less-disturbed sites, which could be due to an increased need for vigilance in exposed grassland and the need to seek cover. In contrast, faeces from all disturbed sites in winter indicated a diet with more GSHR and less heather than faeces from less-disturbed sites. This could be due to a seasonal decline in recreation and increase in hunting activity reversing the disturbance levels at the different sites, since hunting is not normally carried out in areas used by the public for recreation. We conclude that there may be nutritional benefits to deer of reducing disturbance near open grassland."

LGDs create a safer landscape for livestock through accompaniment and the reduction of the abundance and distribution of wild carnivores. However, the effects of LGDs on livestock behavior, group dynamics, and use of space remain understudied. To understand LGDs' impact on sheep behavior and group dynamics, and using a natural experiment approach, we worked on two sheep farms that differed in the use of LGDs to control predation. We used the focal sampling technique to observe sheep behavior; in addition, we obtained information about group size and nearest neighbor distance. Nutritional quality and habitat selection were also assessed. For each individual, we calculated the proportion of time invested in behavioral categories (scanning, feeding, resting, and traveling), and categories between properties were contrasted with the nonparametric U-test, as well as features related to group dynamics, vegetation structure, and food quality. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of LGDs and other management and biological variables on sheep behavior and group properties. In close proximity to LGDs, sheep spent more time in scanning while time allocated to feeding decreased; however, feeding time did not change based on its presence. Moreover, LGDs' company led to the formation of larger sheep groups and individuals closer to each other. Sheep together with LGDs selected habitats with limited plant cover, which allows animals greater visibility. Lastly, we suggest that the ability of LGDs to maintain larger and more cohesive groups in open areas, as well as with more vigilant animals, could increase livestock responsiveness to predator presence, thus helping to reduce probability of predation on sheep and, in consequence, reducing the necessity of killing wild species in retaliation.

As a consequence, a variety of birds and mammals have developed referential and/or urgency-based alarm call systems. Since antipredator behaviour is likely to be costly, it should pay to attend to warning signals given by other species. Evidence that animals respond to heterospecific alarm calls is abundant. However, studies showing whether animals extract information on predator types or urgency levels from heterospecific alarms are rare. Using playback experiments, we investigated whether banded mongooses, Mungos mungo, respond to alarm calls of several sympatric plover species, Vanellus spp. and how mongooses respond to plover alarms that differ in their level of urgency. Banded mongooses responded to alarm calls of the three plover species tested. Even though the response intensity varied over a large scale, the responses to plover alarms did not differ between calls representing high and low urgency. Our results indicate that banded mongooses use heterospecific alarms for predator avoidance but do not use additional information provided in these signals. How commonly animals attend to and why in some cases animals do not attend to additional information provided by heterospecific alarms remains an open question and deserves further investigation.

Hyenas spend less time with their cubs, are more alert during the suckling attempts of cubs, and more frequently resist the attempts of non-offspring. Vigilance against milk theft may therefore influence the distribution of non-offspring nursing across species. Our detailed study of non-offspring nursing in lions shows that females preferentially nurse their own offspring and that cubs are more surreptitious when attempting to suckle from other females. Non-offspring nursing in lions is most common when the costs are lowest. First, non-offspring nursing is more common among close kin. Second, females with small litters, and presumably more milk to spare, give a higher proportion of their nursing to non-offspring. Third, females give a higher proportion of their nursing to non-offspring as their own cubs grow older and need less milk. Cubs reared in creches do not appear to gain more milk that cubs raised alone, and females do not show any evidence of reciprocity in nursing one another's offspring. We suggest that non-offspring nursing in lions occurs as a by-product of the females' communal defense of their cubs against infanticide."

It is not clear, though, if clonal aggregations should have spatial structure, as protecting clone-mates is the genetic equivalent of protecting self. 'Fitness discounting' theory states that immediate reproductive opportunities are of greater value than are delayed opportunities. Thus, we hypothesized that spatial structure should exist in colonies of unequal-aged, clonal organisms like aphids. We predicted that, compared to reproductive (5(th) instar) individuals, young (2(nd) and 3(rd) instar) juveniles (i.e., the youngest instars capable of emitting an alarm signal) should occupy the most dangerous feeding positions. As individuals approach reproductive maturity and alarm signals decline (4(th) instar), they should occupy increasingly safer feeding positions. We tested these predictions by documenting the spatial distribution of two (green and pink) pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, asexual lineages (clones) at 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after host plant colonization. Confirming our hypothesis, we found that early (2(nd) and 3(rd)) instar aphids occupied feeding positions with the highest predation risk. Upon reaching the penultimate (4(th)) instar, individuals dispersed from the colony to colonize other leaves. Thus, pea aphid colonies are not random aggregations; aphid colony structure can be explained by fitness discounting theory."

In order to test these factors, the diurnal time budgets of the Asiatic wild ass was studied using the focal sampling method in Xinjiang Province (China) during 2007. According to our results, all four factors influenced the diurnal time budgets of Asiatic wild ass, which spent more than 45% (up to 66.77%) of their daytime feeding on pastures, and about one third resting (26.2M-38.06%) across all seasons. Moving, vigilance and other activities only made up less than 9% of the activity budgets in the most daytime of a year. Asiatic wild ass showed bimodal feeding activity in most seasons, but with longer daytime resting periods during hot months. In summer, especially during the rut, Asiatic wild ass devoted more significant time to other activities (suckling, moving, courting and agonistic behavior). However, the percentage of time for these activities was still notably lower than feeding and resting."

To our knowledge, a non-intrusive, external marker that is easy to observe does not exist for breeding Ruddy Ducks. We evaluated effects of a modified nasal marker on behavior of female Ruddy Ducks during pre-laying, laying, and brood rearing. There was no evidence that nasal markers had an adverse influence on nesting patterns of pre-laying and laying females. During brood rearing, however, nasal-marked individuals spent more time scratching their bills and less time alert than unmarked controls. Although bill scratching was more frequent, nasal markers did not appear to influence overall reproductive behavior during nesting and or brood rearing, bur. we do not know whether reduced vigilance behavior affected survival of young during brood rearing. This nasal marker is a relatively non-intrusive and visible alternative for studying the short-term reproductive ecology of female Ruddy Ducks and possibly other Oxyurinae or anatids not commonly studied because of unique nasal morphologies (i.e., partially divided nasal septa and small nasal openings) which make them difficult to mark. Additionally, this marker may have application for species wintering in colder regions where nasal markers are at risk of icing. Nevertheless, we strongly suggest that researchers evaluate possible effects of these markers as part and parcel of future studies."

We provided extra food to adult and yearling females in their maternal territories during pregnancy and lactation, and to offspring of these females in their natal areas for 6 weeks after weaning. We used unprovisioned young of unprovisioned mothers as controls. Provisioning influenced the probability of dispersal from the natal area by female but not male S. beldingi. All surviving male S. beldingi dispersed by 55 weeks of age, regardless of whether they and their mothers received extra food. By contrast, we observed a significant trend, beginning 3 weeks after weaning and continuing through the yearling year, for a greater proportion of provisioned than control female S. beldingi to emigrate from the natal area. Competition for food did not appear to influence natal dispersal of females. However, overall population density, density of females weaning litters, and rates of aggression and vigilance among these females, were higher in provisioned than control areas, suggesting that competition for non-food resources was unusually intense in provisioned areas. We propose that juvenile female, but not juvenile male, S. beldingi may emigrate from the natal site to increase access to areas with low densities of conspecifics. Together with findings of earlier workers, our results suggest that spatial and temporal distributions of environmental resources are important influences on the dispersal behavior of female ground squirrels."

Here, we investigate whether colonies of the ant, Formica perpilosa, can balance these demands by dividing labor among workers. We show that foragers collecting nectar in vegetation near their nest are smaller than are those collecting nectar at sites away from the nest. We then use performance tests to show that smaller workers are more likely to succumb to attack from con-specifics but feed on nectar more efficiently than larger workers, suggesting a size-related trade-off between risk susceptibility and harvesting ability. Because foragers that travel away from the nest are probably more likely to encounter ants from neighboring colonies, this trade-off could explain the benefits of dividing foraging labor among workers. In a laboratory experiment, we show that contact with aggressive workers results in an increase in the mean size of recruits to a foraging site: this increase was not the result of more large recruits, but rather because fewer smaller ants traveled to the site. These results suggest that workers particularly susceptible to risk avoid dangerous sites, and suggest that variation in worker size can allow colonies to exploit profitably both hazardous and resource-poor patches."

Only typical gleaner species, such as the Dartford Warbler Sylvia undata, behaved as followers, whereas sit-and-wait species, such as the Stonechat Saxicola torquata, were followed. Both single individuals and homo- or heterospecific flocks acted as followers. The composition of the following flock was highly dynamic, both with respect to number of species and individuals. The result was ephemeral groups consisting of one host and one or more follower individuals which usually broke up when the followed bird flew to a perch without being followed.We analysed the follower-followed relationships between the most interactive pair of species (Dartford Warbler and Stonechat). Following behaviour appeared to consist of two behavioural components: to follow the host when it changed foraging site and to glean prey close to it. When together with a Stonechat, the Dartford Warbler looked for prey mainly on the ground close to the former; when searching alone, it fed mainly in shrubs. The host may be a reliable and predictable indicator of optimum search areas, or the warbler may exploit its vigilance when looking for prey on the ground, or both. The proximity of a follower species altered the searching behaviour of the Stonechat and reduced its capture success by half. The Stonechat's antiparasite strategy mainly consisted of perch changes, to avoid interference. The ecological conditions favouring the development of this kind of following behaviour (habitat openness, cold temperatures, low prey availability, etc.) are discussed."

We tested predictions about demographic differences between cooperative and noncooperative species based on four hypotheses for the evolution of delayed dispersal: the ecological constraints hypothesis, the life history hypothesis, the broad constraints hypothesis and the benefits-of-philopatry hypothesis. We controlled for phylogeny and habitat by comparing sympatric populations of two Australasian treecreepers (Climacteridae): the cooperatively breeding brown treecreeper, Climacteris picumnus, and the pair-breeding white-throated treecreeper, Cormobates leucophaea, which has lost cooperative breeding despite phylogenetic conservation of the trait in most of the treecreeper lineage. Our data failed to support nearly every prediction of the constraints and life history hypotheses. The two species had similar levels of constraints and similar life histories, and any significant differences were in the opposite direction to those predicted. However, the cooperative species was characterized by significantly higher variance in reproductive success as a result of group size effects, supporting the benefits-of-philopatry hypothesis as an explanation for the maintenance of delayed dispersal. Our comparisons also suggest that the benefits parents derive from group living determine whether or not they tolerate offspring on the natal territory. We therefore propose an antipredator tactics hypothesis in which delayed dispersal will initially evolve or be lost in particular taxa depending on the relative costs and benefits of vigilance and active defence versus concealment-based antipredator tactics.

Based on observations collected over two winters during 70 visits to four sites, 87% (483) of the 555 Prothonotary Warblers encountered moved in hocks and over 48% (271) of these individuals were in single-species flocks. Although the propensity to join Rocks was 6% higher for Prothonotary Warblers in the second winter of the study, neither the average size of single-species flocks nor the average number of individuals or species in mixed-species flocks differed between years. Twenty-seven different species were identified in mixed-species Rocks that had at least one Prothonotary Warbler, but Nearctic migrants dominated these flocks. Analyses of focal observations on 57 females and 93 males indicated that Prothonotary Warbler foraging behavior was largely independent of flock type and size. Foraging maneuver, substrate, and location did not differ significantly for individuals of either sex foraging alone, in single-species, or mixed-species flocks. The species is almost strictly insectivorous, gleaning made up 70% of 150 prey capture attempts observed and about half of all attempts (76 of 150) were directed towards leaf surfaces. Foraging generally occurred in the outer third of the tree, on branches less than 1 cm in diameter, in the bottom half of the canopy. Agonistic interactions among flock members that involved Prothonotary Warblers were uncommon and neither fleck type nor size were useful predictors for rates of foraging, movement, preening, or vigilance."
"Lange, H; Leimar, O",The influence of predation risk on threat display in great tits,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,12,375,380,10.1093/beheco/12.4.375,2001,"In wintering birds, conflicts over food are often resolved by threat displays. For displays to be effective, there ought to be a cost associated with displaying. We investigated whether increased vulnerability to predators due to reduced vigilance could be such a cost. Conflicts ought then to be resolved using fewer or less intense displays in conditions of high risk. We also looked for differences between dominants and subordinates in their reaction to risk. Because there is considerable evidence that subordinate wintering birds forage in riskier places than dominants, one might expect dominants to be less successful in conflicts under high predation risk. In our experiment. nine flocks of four or five wintering male great tits were kept in outdoor aviaries. In the predation risk treatment, a stuffed pygmy owl was briefly shown before birds were allowed access to a feeder. In the control treatment the owl did not appear. The predator presentation caused a reduction in the amount of aggression shown by subordinates, whereas for dominants there was no statistically significant change. Dominants were at least as successful in subduing subordinates under high risk as under low risk. A possible interpretation is that our experiment reflected a natural foraging situation for great tits, where ephemeral resources can appear unpredictably. In such situations, dominants may need to be bold to gain priority of access even under increased risk of predation, whereas a subordinate would gain little by risking a conflict with small chances of winning."

Harcourt developed the first of 74 life tables of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), on the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and at nearby sites. This work is cited whenever authors discuss the life history of the diamondback moth and its parasitoids in Canada. Since Harcourt's study, climate change, urbanisation, and crop diversity may have altered the population dynamics of both the diamondback moth and its natural enemy community in the original study area. To follow up on Harcourt's work, we used two approaches to build life tables to describe mortality factors in the field and the natural enemies attacking diamondback moth in Ottawa: destructive sampling of mature cabbage, Brassica oleracea Linnaeus (Brassicaceae), plants similar to Harcourt's approach and a modern sentinel-based approach with an enemy exclusion cage treatment. After 65 years, the primary parasitoids attacking diamondback moth remained the same, although more parasitoid diversity was revealed by the destructive sampling technique. Total mortality and parasitism levels also remained similar. In one notable difference, we attributed more diamondback mortality to predation. Overall, however, diamondback moth population dynamics have changed little in Ottawa in the decades since Harcourt's studies."

Lilly (1964) observed that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sleep with one eye open and one eye closed and suggested that the open eye monitored the immediate area for predators. Mukhametov (1987) and Supin et al. (1978) found no physiological correlation between the active brain hemisphere and the open eye, and suggested that no sentinel function exists. I describe the behavioral and social aspects of sleep in a captive school of four Pacific white-sided dolphins (La genorhynchus obliquidens) at Long Marine Lab at the University of California at Santa Cruz for 32 nights. As the animals swam in formation, I recorded their positions and eye condition. Dolphins did not close their eyes or switch positions in the school randomly. While in formation, dolphins switched positions in bouts while concurrently changing eye condition. This resulted in a sleeping formation in which the dolphins likely had the eye open towards schoolmates, not toward the external environment. I suggest that this allows sleep to proceed while allowing dolphins to maintain visual contact with group members."

Behavioral responses such as changes in swimming patterns of small aquatic invertebrates are emerging as sensitive endpoints to monitor aquatic pollution. Although behavioral responses do not deliver information on an exact type or the intensity of toxicants present in water samples, they could provide orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than lethal endpoints such as mortality. Despite the advantages of behavioral biotests performed on sentinel organisms, their wider application in real-time and near realtime biomonitoring of water quality is limited by the lack of dedicated and automated video-microscopy systems. Current behavioral analysis systems rely mostly on static test conditions and manual procedures that are time-consuming and labor intensive. Tracking and precise quantification of locomotory activities of multiple small aquatic organisms requires high-resolution optical data recording. This is often problematic due to small size of fast moving animals and limitations of culture vessels that are not specially designed for video data recording. In this work, we capitalized on recent advances in miniaturized CMOS cameras, high resolution optics and biomicrofluidic technologies to develop near real-time water quality sensing using locomotory activities of small marine invertebrates. We present proof-of-concept integration of high-resolution time-resolved video recording system and high-throughput miniaturized perfusion biomicrofluidic platform for optical tracking of nauplii of marine crustacean Artemia franciscana. Preliminary data demonstrate that Artemia sp. exhibits rapid alterations of swimming patterns in response to toxicant exposure. The combination of video-microscopy and biomicrofluidic platform facilitated straightforward recording of fast moving objects. We envisage that prospectively such system can be scaled up to perform high-throughput water quality sensing in a robotic biomonitoring facility."

A visual system for automatic driver vigilance has to address two fundamental problems. First of all, it has to analyze the sequence of images and detect if the driver has his eyes open or closed, and then it has to evaluate the temporal occurrence of eyes open to estimate the driver's visual attention level. In this paper we propose a visual approach that solves both problems. A neural classifier is applied to recognize the eyes in the image, selecting two candidate regions that might contain the eyes by using iris geometrical information and symmetry. The novelty of this work is that the algorithm works on complex images without constraints on the background, skin color segmentation and so on. Several experiments were carried out on images of subjects with different eye colors, some of them wearing glasses, in different light conditions. Tests show robustness with respect to situations such as eyes partially occluded, head rotation and so on. In particular, when applied to images where people have eyes closed the proposed algorithm correctly reveals the absence of eyes. Next, the analysis of the eye occurrence in image sequences is carried out with a probabilistic model to recognize anomalous behaviors such as driver inattention or sleepiness. Image sequences acquired in the laboratory and while people were driving a car were used to test the driver behavior analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the whole approach.

Disturbance to nesting common terns (Sterna hirundo) by boats was examined over a five-year period, with different degrees of management of personal watercraft (PWC) activities. In the five years before, this study, reproductive success had declined to zero, perhaps due to excessive personal watercraft activity. Terns responded with significantly more upflights to PWCs that raced by and circled the island, than to motor boats that travelled slowly and remained in the channel. Public meetings and an educational campaign were successful in decreasing the percent of PWCs that raced and ran around the island, which in turn decreased the number of tern upflights and increased reproductive success. Without continued public meetings and education, PWCs began to race around the island, and the terns responded by moving from island edges to central areas that were lower and vulnerable to tidal flooding. In the following year, designated areas for rental PWC use were established, which again decreased the PWC traffic, allowing the birds to nest on the island edges. All management practices increased reproductive success, but a combination of education, public meetings, increased signage, enforcement, and designated zones for PWCs resulted in the greatest increase in reproductive success. Involving stakeholders in the process allowed people and birds to coexist, but continued vigilance and public education were essential to successful management."

We also analyzed patterns of association among bird species, as well as their foraging behavior and the vegetation characteristics associated with birds in flocks. We encountered 333 flocks containing 144 species, of which 26 species had adequate sample sizes for analyses. The size and rate of movement of the hocks were similar to those reported from other Neotropical sires, however, the species richness of our flocks was lower than reported in most other studies, perhaps due to simpler vegetation structure or higher latitude. Only 3 of 50 significant correlations between species pairs were negative, indicating that species generally were not restricted in their participation in mixed-species flocks by other species. In only one instance did we observe correspondence between the association of species-pairs in flocks and their foraging behavior. For most species there was no relationship between association between species-pairs in flocks and vegetation parameters with which they were associated. Thus, additional factors besides foraging facilitation and mutual association with particular vegetation characteristics must be responsible for many of the positive correlations among species pairs. We suggest that non-random association among species within flocks may result in part from enhanced vigilance for predator detection afforded by flock members using similar parts of the environment at the same time."

Thus, the ability to respond to heterospecific alarm calls may be facilitated by possessing both these traits. Gunther's dik-dik (Madoqua guentheri) is a monogamous, territorial, and nonsocial miniature antelope with a simple vocal repertoire. Dik-diks are highly vulnerable to predation and could benefit from eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls. We broadcast recordings of white-bellied go-away bird (Corythaixoides leucogaster) alarm calls to dik-diks to test whether they could respond to heterospecific alarm calls. On hearing a go-away bird alarm call, dik-diks increased their likelihood to run to cover, decreased their foraging activity, increased their rate of head turning, and increased their period of vigilance compared with a nonthreatening bird song. Thus, predation risk alone, in the absence of complex sociality or complex communicative abilities, may be sufficient to drive the evolution of heterospecific eavesdropping."
HAMILTON W III; BULGER J,FACULTATIVE EXPRESSION OF BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ONE-MALE AND MULTIMALE SAVANNA BABOON GROUPS,American Journal of Primatology,28,61,71,,1992,"A one-male unit (OMU) of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) in northern Botawana formed by the asymmetrical fissioning of a multimale (MM) group. During long-term (13 years) observations in the area, which has a relatively high density of baboons, we observed only MM groups with 6 or more adult males per group (N = 19). The behavioral repertoire of the OMU generated a pattern of sociality unrepresentative of these MM groups. Distinctive behavior patterns expressed by the male of the OMU included vigilance oriented away from the group and suppression of intragroup aggression among all other group members. There was also a difference between the foraging and movement patterns of the OMU and those of MM groups in environmentally similar or the same areas. The OMU moved and foraged in a cohesive formation and all group members often foraged in single fruiting trees. Under comparable circumstances at the same time and places MM groups foraged in dispersed formation. Diet and habitat choices of the OMU differed from those of neighboring groups. Patterns of sociality associated with OMUs have been interpreted as responses to extreme environmental conditions [Byrne et al.: Am J Primatol 20:313-319, 1990]. However, it is also possible that alternative behavior patterns are facultative tactical responses to social circumstances. The alternative social styles of OMUs arising within typically MM populations identify the breadth of the behavioral repertoire and the capacity for social flexibility within contemporary savanna baboon and perhaps other primate populations."

In recent years, agricultural land-use changes and increased urbanization have largely contributed to a severe population decline across its range, particularly in its southernmost edge. Assessing the population and habitat status of this species is essential for prioritizing appropriate conservation actions. The present study aims to track population size changes and identify habitat characteristics of the species in Greece via a literature search, questionnaires, and fieldwork for assessing trends in population size as well as spatial K-means analysis for estimating its relation to specific habitat attributes. We found that both distribution size (grid number) and colony numbers of the species decreased in the last decades (by 62.4% and 74.6%, respectively). The remaining colonies are isolated and characterized by low density (mean = 7.4 +/- 8.6 ind/ha) and low number of animals (mean = 13 +/- 16 individuals). Most of the colonies are situated in lowlands and did not relate to specific habitat attributes. Habitat aspect and system productivity (NDVI) were the main factors contributing mostly to the clustering of the existing colonies. These results demonstrate that the species is confined to small, isolated anthropogenic habitats. Specific conservation actions such as population reinforcement, habitat improvement, and specific common agricultural policy measures could effectively improve agroecological zones that are suitable for the maintenance and protection of existing and potential habitats for populations of the species."
"Price, Megan",The impact of human disturbance on birds: a selective review,TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT : CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN HUMAN-WILDLIFE ENCOUNTERS,,163,196,,2008,"Human disturbance is caused by the mere presence of humans in the environment. As both predation risk and human disturbance redirect time and energy from other fitness-enhancing activities such as reproduction and feeding, perceived predation risk appears to be useful in the understanding of the impact of human disturbance. It is essential to understand how birds react to different levels of human disturbance because riskier human behaviour can have devastating effects on habitat use, community composition, reproduction and fitness. Birds tend to overestimate the risk associated with humans rather than underestimate it and risk injury and therefore are more likely to partially habituate to harmless and repetitive human disturbance rather than lose all 'fear' towards humans. As a bird's response dynamically varies with its current assessment of risk and the response is most likely to be context and species-specific, it is difficult to predict with confidence, how birds will react to increased incidences of human disturbance."

Population trends are impossible to quantify due to this species' remote breeding range, low breeding densities and erratic distribution and numbers during winter irruptions in inhabited areas. Mortality due to incidental trapping and shooting is unknown, but its diurnal habits and lack of fear of humans make it vulnerable to persecution. More than 50% of the hawk owl's breeding range occurs in northern forests that are currently noncommercial. Until recently, the majority of the hawk owl's breeding range was unaffected by forestry practices. In the last 20 yr, forestry activities have expanded in commercial northern forests. Modification of clear-cut logging practices have the potential to enhance hawk owl habitat. Variable-sized cuts of <100 ha, interspersed with forest patches and staggered over time, are thought to be optimal. If cuts contain suitable numbers of stumps, snags and trees for hunting perches and nest sites, they will offer year-round habitat. Other factors, such as cut shape and juxtaposition, are probably less important to this striking sentinel of our northernmost forests."
"Fitzgerald, Meghan R.; Ives, Anthony R.",Conspecific Attraction Drives Intraspecific Aggregations by Nephila clavipes Spiders,ETHOLOGY,123,51,60,10.1111/eth.12577,2017,"Aggregation behavior is common throughout the animal world, although it is rare in spiders (Araneae). Nephila clavipes spiders are frequently found both in solitary webs and in aggregations of conspecifics. N.clavipes aggregations are not considered social, because these spiders do not engage in food sharing or group parental care. The currently accepted explanation for N.clavipes aggregations is that they form passively, as spiders aggregate in response to the patchy distribution of food resources in the environment. Here, we show instead that N.clavipes females actively seek out conspecifics and, therefore, that aggregations arise from conspecific attraction. We experimentally established that (1) N.clavipes females actively follow the trails left by conspecifics and (2) aggregations are formed independently of prey density in a particular area.These results suggest that while aggregations in high food patches increase encounter rates of conspecific spiders and support the nutritional needs of multiple large spiders, this potential benefit is not the proximate mechanism for aggregation. Thus, we hypothesize that N.clavipes females likely acquire fitness benefits from aggregating with conspecifics."

I studied foraging behaviour, perch choice and use, and inter- and intraspecific interactions of migratory Brown Shrikes during a 5-day stay at the Kenting National Park Youth Activity Center, southern Taiwan. Brown Shrikes overwhelmingly preferred to perch on protruding branches on a side of the tree canopy (N = 1886; 98.3%), which facilitated detection of prey and vigilance. The Brown Shrikes also rested a lot between hunting bouts while on migration, and hunting rate was very different from that during the breeding season. Of a total of 89 interactions with other individuals, 62 (69.6%) were intraspecific and 27 (30.4%) were interspecific. Of the 62 intraspecific aggressive interactions, 3 were against groups of up to 5 migrating Brown Shrikes that landed in the study plot before heading out to sea, supposedly towards the Philippines across the Luzon Strait. The 7 observed Brown Shrikes had an overall hunting success of 62.7% (106 of 169). I conclude that Brown Shrikes in Taiwan maintain feeding territories while on migration and feed en route and, like most other true shrikes, will adapt to local conditions and their diet will depend on local prey availability."

Factors that may have contributed to the decline include: severe climate, density-dependence, interspecific competition, diseases, harvest, and predation. In this study, we investigate the indirect effects of predation by grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) on this Dall sheep population through the study of their spatial dynamics, in particular the overlap of the species composite home ranges. Between 2006 and 2009, we tracked individuals of the three species with GPS telemetry to describe their home ranges, movements and habitat use. Species composite home ranges revealed substantial overlap between areas used by all three species. The home range of wolves overlapped most of the Dall sheep range. When focusing on the core areas used by Dall sheep, however, the overlap with grizzly bears was larger. This suggests that wolves are likely encountered more often over a wider area whereas grizzly bear encounters are more likely in core areas. To refine our assessment of grizzly bear and wolf predation risk on this Dall sheep population, further analyses on individual and seasonal home range overlap, comparative habitat use, dynamics interactions, Dall sheep vigilance behaviour, predator diet and documentation of traditional ecological knowledge are required."

The current studies investigate how individuals may shift the positivity of self-evaluations in order to sustain their chronic or momentary motivational concerns. Specifically, we propose that more positive self-evaluations support eagerness that sustains promotion-focused concerns with advancement, whereas less positive self-evaluations support vigilance that sustains prevention-focused concerns with safety. The current studies provide evidence that self-evaluation inflation is associated with promotion concerns whereas self-evaluation deflation is associated with prevention concerns, whether regulatory focus is situationally manipulated (Studies 1, 2b, and 3) or measured as a chronic individual difference (Study 2a). Following regulatory focus primes, individuals in a promotion focus showed relatively greater accessibility of positive versus negative selfknowledge compared to individuals in a prevention focus (Study 1). In an ongoing performance situation, participants in a promotion focus reported higher self-esteem than participants in a prevention focus (Studies 2a and 2b). Finally, individuals in a promotion focus persisted longer on an anagram task when given an opportunity to focus on their strengths versus weaknesses, which was not the case for individuals in a prevention focus (Study 3). Across studies, the predicted interactions were consistently obtained, although sometimes the effects were stronger for promotion or prevention motivation. We discuss implications for existing models of the motives underlying self-evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The aim of the study was to ensure that warthogs kept in a captive environment can be housed in the best way possible. It was also to ensure the level of welfare is kept high and to encourage the warthogs' natural behaviours, focusing on play behaviour. The result showed a significant difference in recorded play bouts with most observations at Edinburgh Zoo but with no significant difference in observed play bouts between LMNP and Colchester Zoo. It was concluded that the higher number of play bouts observed at Edinburgh Zoo may be due to the group composition of mainly piglets, but also the substrate and effective enrichment that invited more play. The lack of play in situ is believed to be due to need for foraging and predator vigilance. The most important finding of this study was that ex situ enrichment is encouraging play behaviour as well as preventing stereotypical behaviours, and therefore keeping the welfare high for the warthogs kept in captivity. It was also found that play was observed in excess in the warthogs ex situ if compared to their natural behaviour repertoire in situ, but this is not necessarily negative as play might be the captive animals' only mean of exercise and energy outlet."

However, little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to this association. Research has shown that trait anxiety is associated with an attentional bias (AB) towards threat-relevant information, and some researchers have suggested that such vigilance could exacerbate the detrimental effect of trait anxiety on behavioural preparedness. Conversely, given the potentially adaptive role of AB in promoting engagement in danger mitigation behaviour, it is also possible that AB could ameliorate the negative association between anxiety and preparedness. The aim of this study was to discriminate the validity of these two hypotheses. Method: Participants were recruited from a bushfire-prone community in Western Australia and were assessed on measures of trait anxiety, AB to threat, and current bushfire preparedness. Results: As predicted, the results showed a negative correlation between trait anxiety and bushfire preparedness, and a positive correlation between trait anxiety and AB to bushfire-related threat. Furthermore, the negative relationship between trait anxiety and preparedness was moderated by this AB to bushfire-related threat, with the direction of this moderation showing that AB further exacerbated this negative relationship. Conclusions: This study is the first to show that in a situation where people are exposed to a real-world danger that can be mitigated through appropriate engagement in specific preparatory behaviours, AB to danger-relevant threat serves to strengthen the observed negative association between trait anxiety and behavioural preparedness. Implications of these findings are discussed."

It is also among the major causes of ice dams and glacier lake floods. Previous studies have shown that in the West Kunlun Mountains) (WKM) where a cluster of surge-type glaciers had been found, the glaciers were relatively stable in recent years. Nevertheless, the surge cycle and its impact on glacier changes on a regional scale are poorly understood. In this study, we updated the surge-type glacier inventory of the WKM using the detailed changes in glacier length, surface velocity, and surface elevation during the 1972-2020 period using 78 Landsat optical images, 86 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and three digital elevation models of the WKM. The updated results show that among the 423 glaciers in the WKM, 10 are confirmed as surge-type glaciers, three are likely surge-type glaciers, and five are possible surge-type glaciers. Furthermore, these 18 glaciers account for 63% of the total glacier area. During the period analyzed, there were marked changes in the lengths, areas and surface elevations of all surge-type glaciers, while those of the non-surge-type glaciers were relatively stable. These results appear to indicate that the observed regional trends of glaciers in the WKM recently may be related to the existence of surge-type glaciers. Furthermore, the surge-type glacier underwent advance after accelerating for 3-4 years, which could be used to forecast when glacier termini may advance and avoid the possible catastrophic damages.Plain Language Summary Glacier surging is a form of irregular motion of a glacier, which rapidly transports a volume of ice, followed by a longer slowdown period. In this study, we employed a vast archive of optical and synthetic aperture radar satellite images to monitor the glaciers change in the West Kunlun Mountains (WKM). The results revealed the existence of 18 surge-type glaciers (10 confirmed, 3 likely, and 5 possible) which accounted for 63% of the total area in the WKM. Furthermore, non-surge-type glaciers experienced little changes in recent decades, while surge-type glaciers showed large ice loss. The existence of surge-type glaciers may affect the assessment of glacier change in this region."

We propose that attitudes, behaviors, and states emerging in work and nonwork domains cannot be fully understood without taking into account upstream and downstream sleep quantity and quality effects. Rather, periods of sleep bookend engagement in work and nonwork roles. Thus, we propose the work, nonwork, and sleep (WNS) conceptual framework and, in doing so, identify specific, underlying resource mechanisms (i.e., human energy and time) operating both intra-individually and inter-individually. We also discuss contextual factors that act as predictors and moderators of these relationships. We suggest that a unifying framework explaining connections and underlying processes among work, nonwork, and sleep is necessary for applied psychology and management disciplines to significantly contribute to future research, intervention development and dissemination, and ultimately policy change. We provide a number of avenues for future investigation, including relevant special populations and methodological approaches. Although a plethora of work-nonwork theoretical frameworks exist, none have incorporated the third major area of life: sleep. We call for the expansion and acknowledgement of sleep, an important source of variance in everyday attitudes, behaviors, and states, and ultimately in long-term organizational, family, and individual health and well-being."

For a given group size, interaction rate was higher closer to cover, suggesting that sparrows perceived such locations to be more valuable (i.e., more safe). The rate of aggression was also strongly positively correlated both with the number of birds in the immediate vicinity (within 0.5) and with the total number of birds foraging (within 2 m x 1 m area). The effect of immediate group size on rate of aggression was weaker farther from cover."

We argue that there are at least two shyness subtypes, an early appearing fearful shyness, and a later emerging self-conscious shyness (Buss, 1986) that develop into avoidant and conflicted shyness, respectively, in early childhood and remain relatively stable into adulthood. We proffer that each shyness subtype is presumed to have a different cause and function: fearful/avoidant shyness results from social novelty, its function is to motivate vigilance, action and avoidance of impending threat and harm from conspecifics, and is subserved by evolutionarily old brain circuits; self-conscious/conflicted shyness results from the experience of competing emotions of interest and fear of negative evaluation in social situations, its function is to allow more time for additional learning to take place about conspecifics' intentions and motives before responding, and is linked to relatively newer brain circuits. We argue for a highly speculative idea that self-conscious/conflicted shyness bifurcated from fearful/avoidant shyness later in human evolution as the neocortex grew bigger, self-awareness emerged, and the nature of social interactions became more complex. We further speculate that conflicted shyness may be reflective of neoteny (i.e., delaying maturity and retaining child-like features into adulthood). We also provide some ways in which this shyness-neoteny hypothesis can be empirically tested. We conclude by suggesting that considering the adaptive value of some temperamental phenotypes has implications for how we view normal and abnormal behavior."
"YOUNG, TP; ISBELL, LA",SEX-DIFFERENCES IN GIRAFFE FEEDING ECOLOGY - ENERGETIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS,ETHOLOGY,87,79,89,,1991,"Sex ratios of giraffe groups differ in different habitats, with open vegetation having female-biased groups, and tall, thick vegetation having male-biased groups. On a ranch in south-central Kenya, we quantified habitat differences of male and female giraffe groups and showed that the preference for open habitats by female groups was limited to groups with young. We suggest that this difference is due to the avoidance of predators of young giraffes. We also showed that rates of giraffe feeding peaked at intermediate feeding heights equal to approximately 60% of adult giraffe height. In the dense habitats with a variety of tree heights used by male groups and female groups without young, both male and female giraffes fed most at heights where they could feed fastest. However, in the open habitats used by female groups with young, females fed mostly at heights below optimum because these habitats are dominated by short food plants. On the other hand, the dominant males accompanying these female groups fed at heights above optimum on rare tall trees, possibly to increase intrasexual vigilance. Apparently, both male and female giraffes sometimes forfeit feeding efficiency for short-term reproductive gains."

In an area with two available habitats, Zostera seagrass beds and unvegetated sand flats, males occurred almost exclusively in seagrass, whereas the females occurred at equal densities in both habitats. Estimates of intake rates seemed greater for individuals foraging in seagrass (0.114-0.128 g dry mass (DM)(.)min(-1)) than on sand (0.064-0.087 g DM.min(-1)). Males appeared less well adapted for foraging on sand than in seagrass, and the presence of females could interfere with males' foraging on sand. The reason for the equal distribution of the females between the habitats probably lies in the inability of one particular habitat to support the entire population of females. Little interhabitat movement by individuals was detected. Within a habitat, sexes moved synchronously at the 1-ha scale but showed a degree of segregation at the individual scale, suggesting that some avoidance existed. Three diet types were observed in the godwits in the area: (1) dominated by soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus) on sand, (2) dominated by sentinel crabs (Macrophthalmus spp.) in seagrass, and (3) dominated by soft-bodied prey in seagrass."

First of all, (1) noise creates an unavoidable trade-off between two kinds of error by receivers. Furthermore, (2) a receiver's optimal criterion for response depends on the level of signals and (3) a signaller's optimal level of signalling depends on the receiver's criterion. As a result, (4) communication in noise can evolve to a joint optimum. (5) Communication at a joint optimum is honest on average. (6) Joint optima for communication in noise do not eliminate noise. (7) Many parameters of communication in noise remain poorly studied. (8) Noise leads to strong predictions for the evolution of exaggeration and thresholds. (9) Signals for advertising and for warning are contrasts in probable costs of errors. (10) The evolution of new signals and responses encounters a hurdle. (11) New signals and responses can evolve by exploitation. (12) Joint evolution of signallers and receivers has a predictable direction. These predictions will remain untested hypotheses until communication in noise is studied more thoroughly than it has been previously. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The wider context for the study is provided by risk theory, research on public responses to emerging infectious diseases (EID) and the concept of biocommunicability. We focus on reflexivity in engaging with media, views on the government's response, and vigilance and behaviour change. EID fatigue, a predisposition toward distrusting the media, personal circumstances and location within particular social networks, shaped responses to news reporting of swine flu. People did not link swine flu to already stigmatised groups because they identified it as resident in the community. The continuing dependency of lay publics upon governments and expert systems may help to explain the lack of criticism directed at more traditionally powerful groups. Distancing took a variety of forms. While newspapers emphasised the novel and deadly swine flu narrative, audiences readily described it as just another flu and were unconcerned about contracting it. However, some imagined that others were more vulnerable to the effects of media reporting. Some reported searching the internet for information, which may explain the differences between how they saw it and how it was reported. Also influential was the fact that their lived experiences did not bear out the novelty or seriousness of swine flu. Our discussion is informed by our concurrent analyses of media coverage and interviews with EID experts and journalists involved in the reporting."

Feelings of loneliness are common among young adults, and are hypothesized to impair the quality of sleep. In the present study, we tested associations between loneliness and sleep quality in a nationally representative sample of young adults. Further, based on the hypothesis that sleep problems in lonely individuals are driven by increased vigilance for threat, we tested whether past exposure to violence exacerbated this association.Method. Data were drawn from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a birth cohort of 2232 twins born in England and Wales in 1994 and 1995. We measured loneliness using items from the UCLA Loneliness Scale, and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We controlled for covariates including social isolation, psychopathology, employment status and being a parent of an infant. We examined twin differences to control for unmeasured genetic and family environment factors.Results. Feelings of loneliness were associated with worse overall sleep quality. Loneliness was associated specifically with subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction. These associations were robust to controls for covariates. Among monozygotic twins, within-twin pair differences in loneliness were significantly associated with within-pair differences in sleep quality, indicating an association independent of unmeasured familial influences. The association between loneliness and sleep quality was exacerbated among individuals exposed to violence victimization in adolescence or maltreatment in childhood.Conclusions. Loneliness is robustly associated with poorer sleep quality in young people, underscoring the importance of early interventions to mitigate the long-term outcomes of loneliness. Special care should be directed towards individuals who have experienced victimization."

We proposed to address this problem with train-triggered warning signals, consisting of flashing lights and bell sounds emitted in the 30 s leading up to train arrival, that animals could learn to associate with train arrival. We installed our warning systems at four sites on an active railway where train-triggered cameras recorded the responses of animals to trains. We contrasted the observed flight initiation times when warning signals were active (treatment) and inactive (control) and when trains approached from straight versus curved track, predicting that animals would be more responsive to warning signals on curved approaches because those trains would be harder for animals to detect. When warning signals were provided, animals left the track earlier. For animals larger than and including coyotes (Canis latrans), flight responses were 62% earlier (17.0 s, SE = 1.5 vs. 10.5 s, SE = 1.2); smaller animals initiated flight responses 29% earlier (14.6 s, SE = 1.9 vs. 11.3 s, SE = 1.6). Contrary to our prediction, animals were more responsive to warning signals when trains approached from straightaways (large animals 10.3 s earlier for treatment, SE = 2.6; small animals 4.2 s earlier for treatment, SE = 2.4) than when trains approached from curves (large animals 2.7 s earlier for treatment, SE = 2.8; small animals 2.4 s earlier for treatment, SE = 1.6). Non-aversive warning systems could reduce train collisions by providing additional time for animals to adopt an effective escape trajectory."

We assessed the seasonal group-size variation in these regions and found that the largest groups formed in autumn and winter. Chinkara groups never exceeded eight individuals in the studied areas. Solitary Chinkaras were observed very often in the study areas. The mean group size of Chinkara had significant difference between seasons in two protected areas. As a result, Chinkara group size in central Iran is one of the smallest ever documented in the world. Such small group sizes are likely due to the arid environment and poor-quality vegetation of the studied regions.

If behaviors are not independent, then the nature of the relationship would illustrate potential performance constraints. We studied crimson rosellas (Platycercus elegans) and first focused on acoustic predator discrimination. We measured time allocation before and after playback of one of three experimental treatments (peregrine falcons-Falco peregrinus, wedge-tailed eagles-Aquila audax, and crimson rosellas) to determine whether or not rosellas discriminated predators from non-predators, and specifically whether or not they discriminated large from small predators. We then focused on the decision to flee. We experimentally approached subjects and measured the distance at which they oriented to us (alert distance) and the distance at which they fled (flight initiation distance; FID). We found that rosellas could distinguish among predators; however, there was no effect on general wariness as measured by FID. These two processes of antipredator behavior may, thus, be independent."

One hypothesis to explain this prolonged partnership is that males are guarding their female partners from rival males. This hypothesis has three predictions, that males are more aggressive than females to conspecific males, that male aggression will increase as the time of mating gets closer, and that males will be more aggressive towards conspecific males when they are with their partner than when they are alone. We tested those predictions with indirect evidence of aggression, using counts of scale damage on randomly encountered lizards, and with direct observations of their responses to approaches by conspecific and heterospecific models. As predicted by the mate guarding hypothesis, males showed more evidence of aggression towards conspecifics than did females. However, in contrast to the hypothesis, males did not become more aggressive as the time of mating came closer, and males in pairs were less aggressive than males on their own. Mate guarding cannot be the only process that has led to the prolonged monogamous associations in this species. Parental care is also unknown in these lizards, and we suggest that monogamy may be maintained through some form of female coercion, allowing females to gain additional fitness from the enhanced vigilance that results from male proximity."

Sixty-one female subjects were studied under rest, handgrip, and vigilance tasks and then under one of three appraisal instructions (Full, Excuse, and Ignore provocation) intended to modify the intensity of an ensuing anger provocation. Dependent variables included emotional self-reports, video ratings of facial expressions, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Emotional self-reports indicated more anger in the Full than in the other provocation groups, but no group differences existed in fear, exhaustion, positive affect or interest. Ratings of facial expressions and results of the post-experimental interview corroborated and extended these findings. Diastolic blood pressure responses were largest in the Full provocation group. Moderator analyses showed that person-based boundary conditions were restricted since aggressivity, but neither neuroticism, achievement motivation, extraversion, nor social desirability influenced the anger induction x self-reported anger relationship: The regression function slope of aggressivity on self-reported anger was significantly larger for the Full compared to the combined Excuse and Ignore provocation groups. Johnson-Neyman confidence intervals for self-reported anger showed that across provocation groups aggressivity was selectively engaged only for above-average aggressivity scores. Unexpectedly, aggressivity was also a strong moderator for provocation group x self-reported fear relationships. Selective trait activation as an instance of person x environment interaction was explained with perceived situational demands and mutually inhibitory anger x fear relation ships.

Secondly, the architecture of stacked DNCs is proposed and modified for electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis.

Although overlaps in habitat or diet create opportunities for competition to occur between species, competition only results from such overlap if it affects one or both species negatively. Less attention has been afforded to possible behavioural modifications induced in wildlife by competition with domestic livestock. Here, we investigated the effects of the presence of livestock on feeding behaviour of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in southern Patagonia, using focal sampling of individuals during foraging bouts, with instantaneous scan samples to estimate group behavioural budgets. We recorded guanaco bite and step rates, used as proxies of foraging intake and selectivity, from four different study sites over eight consecutive seasons. We also estimated sheep and guanaco densities per site, along with vegetation biomass availability. As in other ungulates, bite rates of guanaco appear to be highly flexible and generally increased with vegetation biomass availability. However, as sheep densities and thus additional grazing pressure increased, guanaco foraging strategy compensated by increasing bite rates when foraging vegetation was scarce, indicating further likelihood of competition. Additionally, scan samples indicated that the probability of guanaco feeding occurring at any one time was higher in areas shared with domestic sheep compared to national parks, suggesting guanaco have to focus more on feeding than other behaviours when sheep are present."

We contrasted the digging behavior of groups of three same-sex, adult-sized individuals with that of solitary degus. The behavior of singles and trios was recorded inside a large terrarium partially filled with natural soil and under controlled conditions of food, light, and temperature. The observation that degus in groups do not decrease their burrowing time or frequency of digging compared with solitary diggers does not support the hypothesis that communal burrowing is a primary cause of degu sociality. On the other hand, the observation that degus in groups removed significantly more soil per capita than solitary digging degus, and that grouped individuals coordinated their digging - group members burrowed mostly in the same sites and formed digging chains -, suggests that social burrowing may potentially reduce the cost of burrow construction in the long term. We suggest that such longterm benefits will be a consequence rather than a cause of degu group-living."

However, progress has been limited thus far due to differences in approaches between psychologists and behavioral ecologists. Although the former tend to use controlled experiments to pinpoint precise cognitive mechanisms, these experiments often lack ecological validity. In contrast, behavioral ecologists seek to understand the adaptive function of cooperative behavior of animals in the wild but typically neglect the underlying psychological mechanisms. Here we appraise and integrate evidence from these two approaches to understand the potential cognitive solutions to four fundamental challenges that animals face during cooperative interactions under natural conditions: (1) when to cooperate; (2) with whom to cooperate; (3) what to do in cooperative interactions; (4) how much to contribute to cooperation. We argue that an ecologically motivated approach is critical to understanding the psychological mechanisms of cooperation and how these mechanisms evolve."

We tested whether box turtles (Terrapene carolina) use chemical information to distinguish between predatory and nonpredatory mammals. Box turtles in our study exhibited more escape behavior when exposed to urine from a predator (coyote, Canis latrans) than when exposed to urine from a nonpredator (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus) or a blank control. Escape behavior is consistent with an antipredator response. In addition, the turtles decreased their handling time for food when in the presence of urine from either species of mammal in comparison to the blank, indicating that chemical cues from mammals in general may result in increased vigilance by terrestrial turtles. Examination of a variety of response variables may be important for adequate assessment of the ecological role of chemosensory behavior."

Bulls left stable maternal groups when 2-years-old and formed loose temporary associations with peers. Dominance hierarchies were established within these bachelor groups. Adult bulls showed a tendency to become increasingly solitary with age, and formed transient associations with cows. Adult bulls exhibited little overt competition for mates during the rut.

We conducted an experiment to test how the selections of particular feeding sites and items are influenced by food quality, food quantity, and predation risks. Free-ranging wild Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were presented with food items that differed in: preference by the birds, level of abundance, and context of risk of predation. An increase in predation risk resulted in a marked decrease in the number of attempts by the ducks to get food, as well as in the speed at which they approached the feeding site. Slower approach times with higher predation risk were due to increased vigilance. An increase in food abundance compensated for the risks incurred; at a given level of predation risk ducks approached sites with abundant food significantly more often than sites with little food. However, food abundance did not affect approach speed. Approach attempts and times were not influenced by the quality of the items, but this result seemed to be an artifact of the experimental design."

Consistent interindividual differences in feeding times were found and two sources of this variation were identified. Time spent feeding was found to decline with female age; rhesus mothers 4-6 years old spent over 40% more time feeding than did females 11-15 years of age. When the animals were divided into high- and low-status groups, dominance was also found to relate to individual feeding times; high-status females spent more time feeding that did low-status females, but this difference was evident only when the effect of female age was held constant. The age effect is probably an expression of age-related variation in nutritional requirements due to growth in the youngest subjects and, perhaps, a declining basal metabolic rate in the oldest. We speculate that the comparatively weak dominance effect is due less to the aggressive interruption of feeding bouts than it is to a presumed greater vigilance on the part of subordinant mothers in monitoring their infants' whereabouts."

Although many studies have examined individual differences in both intermittent locomotion and boldness separately, to our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the relationship between these 2 traits. Characterizing and understanding this relationship is important, as both locomotion and boldness are associated with several ecologically relevant behaviors such as foraging, mating, predator evasion, exploration, and dispersal. Here, we report on individual differences in boldness (risk-taking behavior) and intermittent locomotion in a novel laboratory environment in field-caught juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Our results show that juvenile bluegill sunfish exhibited individual-level variation in 2 modes of intermittent locomotion (undulatory and labriform swimming) and that this variation was correlated with differences in their boldness behavior. Generally, bolder individuals spent more time moving fast for longer durations and with shorter pauses than more timid individuals. Neither boldness nor locomotion was correlated with body size or body condition. This study provides the first empirical evidence for a link between an animal personality trait and intermittent locomotion."

Copulation success was used to differentiate individuals into two groups (successful and unsuccessful) and to provide a basis for behavioral comparisons, throughout both mating (rut) and non mating seasons. The results indicated significant differences between the behavior patterns of successful and unsuccessful females; however, the reproductive season played an important environmental factor. Pooling results across reproductive seasons, successfully copulating females showed significantly higher frequencies of vigilance and lower frequency of feeding behavior as compared with unsuccessfully copulating females. In the non-mating season, unsuccessfully copulating females had higher frequency of self-directed behavior, environment sniffing, and were less aggressive than successful copulating females. Furthermore, females who were successful at copulating also demonstrated tail-pasting behavior; however, this only occurred during the rut season. The results of this study can improve management practices for musk deer farms through increasing mating success and reducing maintenance costs. Furthermore, variation in behavior may also be used as a predictor of copulation success and reproductive potential, whereby females can be grouped and separated according to their reproductive history and past reproduction success."

While many hypotheses have been advanced to explain non-repetitive calls, the function of repetitive calling has received relatively little attention. We presented juvenile Richardson's ground squirrels with a predator model at distances ranging from 1 to 8 m and recorded the subsequent repetitive calls on digital audiotape. The rate of calling was inversely correlated with the distance between the model and the caller, with distance explaining almost 24% of the variation in call rate. To determine whether call recipients use that information, we manipulated the intersyllable latency of a single repetitive call exemplar to form 3 test stimuli varying only in call rate. Across 16 Richardson's ground squirrel colonies to which these calls were broadcast, the proportion of squirrels assuming the highly vigilant, alert posture increased with the rate of the repetitive call presented. Hence, juvenile Richardson's ground squirrels appear to communicate the proximity and presumably the degree of threat posed by potential predators."

Shrub microhabitat is typically considered safer than open microhabitat for these small mammals. We investigated predation risk for Townsend's ground squirrels (Spermophilus townsendii), which are diurnal desert rodents that detect predators visually and use burrows for refuge. Our results suggested that shrub cover may increase risk for these squirrels by decreasing their ability to escape from predators. Our field experiment indicated that running speeds of juvenile squirrels were lower in shrub (Ceratoides lanata) habitat than in open areas. Shrub cover was also associated with shorter predator-detection distances (mammalian and avian) and fewer refuges (burrow entrances per hectare) than in open areas in one year but not in another. Our study demonstrated that the visual and locomotive obstruction of vegetative cover may increase predation risk for diurnal desert rodents and that elements of habitat-dependent risk may be temporally dynamic."

The study of this behaviour during the post-fledging period suggested that it reflects mainly, but not only, anti-predator behaviour. The frequency of vigilance and aggressive chases decreased through the post-fledging period as predicted by theoretical models of nest defence. Although predation risks were similar, Black Kites invested more time chasing intruders than did Red Kites. Black Kites, unlike Red Kites, chased away intruding juveniles, which may be interpreted as a behaviour to avoid investment in unrelated fledglings. Black Kites usually nest in loose colonies where the risk of, and selection pressures against, accidental investment in unrelated fledglings is likely to be greater than for Red Kites. Differences in aggressive chases by Black and Red Kites are better related to this than to different predation risks."

The aim of this study was to test the existence of a trait gregariousness in horses, by testing the stability across situations and over time of the responses to different social events. Sixty-six Welsh ponies and 44 Anglo-Arab horses were successively tested at 8 months and 1.5 years of age. Among them, 33 ponies and 21 horses were also tested at 2.5 years of age. They were submitted to four test situations: isolation and separation from, attraction towards and passing conspecifics. We carried out the analysis using each of four test groups as a unit (e.g. 33 Welsh ponies born in 2001, tested in isolation).Isolation and separation stood out as tests that showed a high consistency within test, across tests and across time. The most interesting behavioural parameter was the frequency of neighing, which was well correlated with other parameters measured in the same tests, such as defecation, locomotion and vigilance, as well as across the 3 years (e.g. for separation test: 0.41 < R < 0.61). Therefore, the behaviour of neighing observed in separation or isolation tests as early as 8 months of age appears to be a good indicator of similar behaviour in similar situations later in life, but also of other behaviours which can render the horse difficult to use.No parameter recorded during the attraction test presented stability across situations and time: the reactions to this test were not the expression of a stable characteristic of the individual and did not reflect the same characteristic as the three other tests.Of the different parameters recorded during the passing conspecifics test, the time to cross the arrival line near conspecifics showed good stability across years (0.35 < R < 0.68). This parameter was also correlated with many others recorded during the same test, and also, to a certain extent, to the frequency of neighing in the isolation and separation tests.This stability across responses expressed in various social contexts, and this stability over time, from 8 months to 2.5 years of age suggest the existence of a trait of gregariousness in the horse. From a practical point of view, that means it is possible to estimate the level of gregariousness of a horse as early as 8 months of age. Furthermore, additional analysis shows that gregariousness decreases with age. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

These effects, if indicative of stress, can be of welfare concern. However, few options to mitigate visitor effects through modulating visitor behaviour have been explored. Here we evaluated the effects of visitor number and visitor noise level on the behaviour of five UK groups of Sulawesi crested macaques. We also investigated whether visitor behaviour can be effectively modulated through targeted signage requesting visitors to be quiet, and assessed the use of signs incorporating salient 'watching' human eyes, novel to a zoo setting, alongside 'control' signs lacking eyes.We used scan sampling to collect over 100 h of behavioural observation data, analysis of which indicated that Sulawesi crested macaques were significantly affected by both visitor number and noise level at all five zoos. We found that active behaviours, such as locomotion or foraging, and behaviours identified as negative for welfare, such as vigilance, increased with increasing visitor number and noise levels, whereas resting and social huddling decreased. The extent to which these behavioural changes reflect welfare, particularly the increase seen in active behaviours, is not clear. We also found that both sign treatments, with and without salient eyes, slightly but significantly reduced visitor noise levels compared with no sign, although signs displaying human eyes were not more effective than the control signs.Our results highlight a need for further research into active behaviours to assess whether increases in these behaviours are associated with stress. While we found signage to be a promising tool to mitigate against these visitor effects, our results also suggest areas in which signs incorporating salient human eyes could be adapted for the zoo environment in order to realise their full potential."

Less is know about sleep in solitary and social invertebrates, particularly the ants. This paper reports a study of light/dark periods on worker activity as well as sleep location, posture and the wake/sleep cycles of fire ant workers and queens located in an artificial nest chamber. Workers slept in one of three locations: on the ceiling, against the chamber wall or in the center of the chamber floor. Workers on the ceiling or against the chamber wall slept for longer periods than those at the center of the chamber floor where most grooming and feeding activity occurred. When sleeping, queens huddled together. Their close contact generated synchronized wake/sleep cycles with each other. Sleep posture was distinctly different than wake posture. During deep sleep, queens and workers folded their antennae and were non-responsive to contact by other ants. Another indicator of deep sleep was rapid antennal movement (RAM sleep). Sleep episodes were polyphasic. Queens averaged similar to 92 sleep episodes per day, each episode lasting similar to 6 min, for a total of similar to 9.4 h of sleep per day. Workers averaged similar to 253 sleep episodes lasting 1.1 min each for a total of similar to 4.8 h of sleep per day. Activity episodes were unaffected by light/dark periods. Workers were hypervigilant with an average of 80% of the labor force completing grooming, feeding or excavation tasks at any given time. These findings reinforce the parental exploitation hypothesis-sterile workers are a caste of disposable, short-lived helpers whose vigilance and hyperactivty increases the queen's fitness by buffering her and her fertile offspring from environmental stresses."

The present study evaluated the behavior of land use changes in the period of 2007 and 2016, and identified the influence of these changes on the Atlantic Forest vegetation and the expected consequences for a future scenario in the short (2020) and medium term (2025). The study was developed in the Una river basin, located in southeastern Brazil. Land use mapping was performed using Landsat 5 and Sentinel-2A satellite imagery, with visual interpretation techniques. The assessment of land use changes and ecological losses was modeled in the Land Change Modeler and the gains and losses for each category and their future scenarios were identified. The calculations of landscape metrics were performed with the V-LATE extension for ArcGIS. The Anthropogenic Exposure Indicator was applied to evaluate the exposure of fragments. The comparative between land uses showed an increase of 484.33 ha of anthropogenic areas and a decrease of 484.14 ha of vegetation. The greater conversion of forests to other uses was related to agriculture. The fragments are under intense edge effect and 13.70% are under high anthropogenic exposure. By 2016, a loss of 484 ha of Atlantic Forest was identified, being expected a loss of 694.11 ha by 2020 and of 934.10 ha by 2025."

Their ability to discriminate among individual alarm callers and to identify the location of those callers may allow receivers to track predator movement from acoustic information in multiple-caller bouts. Observations of encounters with live terrestrial and avian predators revealed that squirrels were significantly more likely to produce a multiple-caller bout that tracked predator movement when avian predators were airborne than when predators remained on the ground. To test whether receivers perceived such differences, squirrels were presented with playbacks of multiple-caller bouts composed of either chirps (commonly issued in response to airborne predators), or whistles (commonly issued in response to predators on the ground) from callers that were either unfamiliar or familiar to the receiver. In response to unfamiliar chirps, but not unfamiliar whistles, receivers were significantly more vigilant when call bouts progressively increased in proximity than when call bouts progressively decreased in proximity. Thus, Richardson's ground squirrels use multiple alarm callers to track airborne avian but not terrestrial predators, presumably owing to the more immediate threat that airborne predators pose, but also because of the relative paucity of directional information in bouts of whistle calls associated with potential threats on the ground. Squirrels were more responsive to calls from familiar neighbours, however, and despite our relatively small sample of familiar caller playbacks, receivers showed limited evidence of differential response to approaching versus receding bouts of whistle calls when they were familiar with callers.

"SWENSON, JE",HAZEL GROUSE (BONASA-BONASIA) PAIRS DURING THE NONBREEDING SEASON - MUTUAL BENEFITS OF A COOPERATIVE ALLIANCE,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,4,14,21,10.1093/beheco/4.1.14,1993,"During the nonbreeding season (autumn and winter), hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) males and females associate as loosely bound pairs, not as strongly bound pairs as previously thought. These pairs could be considered cooperative alliances, with each member gaining both direct and indirect benefits. The most important direct benefit appeared to be mutual vigilance against predators. This benefit was found at two levels: at the level of arboreal feeding sites, two birds could forage faster and farther from cover than single birds, and at the territory scale, the pair was together more in dangerous habitats. By foraging farther from cover, two birds could use about 23% more of the preferred food trees and 9%-10% more of the food available within a territory than a single bird, partially mitigating the cost of having two birds feeding on limited winter food in the same space. Defending a common territory appeared to be a less important direct benefit of the alliance because the members of a pair did not defend the same territory and often associated with neighboring birds of the opposite sex. A future benefit of the alliance was having breeding partners in the spring; this was most beneficial for males, as the sex ratio was male biased. Members of the pair were often apart. At arboreal feeding sites, this separation was perhaps because the most preferred trees, black alders (Alnus glutinosa) with the most staminate catkins, were located in areas with the most cover, where one bird may be safer from predators than two. Members of pairs in more secure habitats were more often with extrapair birds of the opposite sex. This suggested a trade-off; birds in safe habitats may have visited potential breeding partners, but birds in dangerous habitats may have had to remain together, foregoing this option, to increase their survival probability. This social organization appeared to be an adaptation to surviving in a heterogeneous habitat, with some of the winter food located in dense cover and some located in more open and dangerous situations."

Additionally, these fluxes are seldom measured, hindering critical evaluation of model output. Analysis of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), a one-dimensional integral lake model, was performed to assess its ability to reproduce diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and the sensitivity of simulated fluxes to changes in model parameters, i.e., turbulent transport parameters and the light extinction coefficient (K-d). A C++ open-source software package, Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), was used to perform sensitivity analysis (SA) and identify the parameters that dominate model behavior. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) was applied to quantify the fluxes' uncertainty, comparing daily-averaged eddy-covariance observations to the output of CSLM. Seven qualitative and two quantitative SA methods were tested, and the posterior likelihoods of the modeled parameters, obtained from the GLUE analysis, were used to determine the dominant parameters and the uncertainty in the modeled fluxes. Despite the ubiquity of the equifinality issue - different parameter-value combinations yielding equivalent results-the answer to the question was unequivocal: K-d, a measure of how much light penetrates the lake, dominates sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the uncertainty in their estimates is strongly related to the accuracy with which K-d is determined. This is important since accurate and continuous measurements of K-d could reduce modeling uncertainty."
"Maslo, Brooke; Burger, Joanna; Handel, Steven N.",Modeling foraging behavior of piping plovers to evaluate habitat restoration success,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,76,181,188,10.1002/jwmg.210,2012,"Habitat restoration projects are often deemed successful based on the presence of the target species within the habitat; however, in some cases the restored habitat acts as an ecological trap and does not help to improve the reproductive success of the target species. Understanding wildlifehabitat relationships through precise measurements of animal behavior can identify critical resources that contribute to high quality habitat and improve habitat restoration practice. We evaluated the success of a restored piping plover (Charadrius melodus) breeding habitat in New Jersey, USA. We identified the major factors influencing foraging rates, compared foraging activity budgets over 3?yr at restored and natural habitats, and explored the potential of artificial tidal ponds as a viable restoration alternative. Adult foraging rates were higher in artificial pond and ephemeral pool habitats, during low tide, and after breeding activity ended. Adult foraging rates were impeded by the presence of people and vehicles within 50 m. Chick foraging rates were highest at artificial ponds and bay shores and lowest in dunes and on sand flats. Chick foraging rates were strongly hindered by the presence of corvids and the number of people within 50 m. In addition, at artificial tidal ponds, piping plovers spent more time foraging and less time engaged in defensive behaviors (vigilance, crouching, and fleeing) compared to other potential habitats. Our findings support the hypothesis that artificial tidal ponds are a valuable, perhaps superior, foraging habitat. Future beach restoration projects should include this feature to maximize habitat quality and restoration success. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society."

It is an important vector for three reasons: its opportunistic blood-feeding behavior, its ability to forage and locate hosts in a variety of habitats, and its ability to retain eggs for long periods when suitable oviposition sites are unavailable. Results of laboratory and field observations documenting that Cx. nigripalpus fits the above criteria are presented. Field data are also presented showing that SLE activity in sentinel birds as well as in humans occurs in Florida during years when heavy autumn rainfalls are separated by periods of drought. Blood feeding and oviposition behaviors of Cx. nigripalpus are affected by rainfall. Large amounts of rainfall allow mosquitoes to oviposit and then to enter and blood feed in habitats where they could not previously forage because of the dry conditions. Thus, rainfall patterns are an important part of the SLE transmission cycle in southern Florida."

After estimating LC50 ([mu]l L-1) and LT50 (days) of both organophosphrous pesticides over 60 days, the impact of [half] LC50 of roundup (1.1[mu]l L-1) and reldan (0.6 [mu]l L-1) was measured. After two months of treatment, reldan reduced valve activity more than roundup; the rest period increased with increasing time of exposure. There was direct relationship between valve movement and metabolic heat output of respiration and excretion. The decrease in respiration rate was associated with a decrease in ammonia excretion. Thus valve-movement responses of R. decussatus to 1/2 LC50 of the two pesticides are type-dependent. Both pesticides reduced physiological condition, but reldan is more potent than roundup and its effect is time-dependent. Respiration and excretion rates were components of the energy expenditure that accounted for the decline in metabolism and excretion with increasing the time of exposure to pesticides. This study highlights the potential use of behavioural and physiological response of a sentinel organism for monitoring the pesticides in the marine environment."

Meeting increasing demand for meat and other dairy products in a sustainable manner is a big challenge. At a field scale, Global Positioning System and ground-based sensor technologies provide promising tools for grassland and herd management with high precision. With the growth in availability of spaceborne remote sensing data, it is therefore important to revisit the relevant methods and applications that can exploit this imagery. In this article, we have reviewed the (i) current status of grassland monitoring/observation methods and applications based on satellite remote sensing data, (ii) the technological and methodological developments to retrieve different grassland biophysical parameters and management characteristics (i.e. degradation, grazing intensity) and (iii) identified the key remaining challenges and some new upcoming trends for future development.Important FindingsThe retrieval of grassland biophysical parameters have evolved in recent years from classical regression analysis to more complex, efficient and robust modeling approaches, driven by satellite data, and are likely to continue to be the most robust method for deriving grassland information, however these require more high quality calibration and validation data. We found that the hypertemporal satellite data are widely used for time series generation, and particularly to overcome cloud contamination issues, but the current low spatial resolution of these instruments precludes their use for field-scale application in many countries. This trend may change with the current rise in launch of satellite constellations, such as RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and even the microsatellites such as those operated by Skybox Imaging. Microwave imagery has not been widely used for grassland applications, and a better understanding of the backscatter behaviour from different phenological stages is needed for more reliable products in cloudy regions. The development of hyperspectral satellite instrumentation and analytical methods will help for more detailed discrimination of habitat types, and the development of tools for greater end-user operation."

We examined habitat and patch use in rock hyraxes (Procavia capensis) inhabiting a group of kopjes in a semiarid savanna, Augrabies Falls National Park, South Africa. We tested the prediction of more intense patch use closer to the central place by measuring giving-up densities (GUDs) in experimental resource patches set at four different distances from the kopje and in two microhabitats differing in cover. Surprisingly, hyraxes had their lowest GUDs at intermediate distances from the kopje. These unexpected results suggest that the sentinel behaviour of hyraxes alters the probability of detection of predators for animals foraging away from the kopje."
"Drake, Alistair",Automatically operating radars for monitoring insect pest migrations.,Entomologia Sinica,9,27,39,,2002,"Over the last three decades, special-purpose entomological radars have contributed much to the development of our understanding of insect migration, especially of the nocturnal migrations at altitudes of up to - 1 km that are regularly undertaken by many important pest species. One of the limitations of early radar studies, the difficulty of maintaining observations over long periods, has recently been overcome by the development of automated units that operate autonomously and transmit summaries of their observations to a base laboratory over the public telephone network. These relatively low-cost Insect Monitoring Radars (IMRs) employ a novel ZLC configuration that allows high quality data on the migrants' flight parameters and identity to be acquired. Two IMRs are currently operating in the semi-arid inland of eastern Australia, in a region where populations of migrant moths (Lepidoptera) and Australian plague locusts Chortoicetes terminifera (Orthoptera) commonly originate, and some examples of outputs from one of these units are presented. IMRs are able to provide the data needed to characterize a migration system, i.e. to estimate the probabilities of migration events occurring in particular directions at particular seasons and in response to particular environmental conditions and cues. They also appear capable of fulfilling a sentinel role for pest-management organisations, alerting forecasters to major migration events and thus to the likely new locations of potential target populations. Finally, they may be suitable for a more general ecological monitoring role, perhaps especially for quantifying year-to-year variations in biological productivity."

The abundance of T. sarcophagae and rarity of species of Spalangia Latreille, 1805 are in marked contrast to results of surveys conducted in the United States. This difference suggests that species used to manage populations of pestiferous flies associated with livestock in the United States could be inappropriate for use in Canada."

Approach/avoidance conflict is created by presenting a stimulus between the individual test sheep and a group of companions. In this study, an arena test was used to assess differences in the aversiveness of a box, goat, human and dog. In addition, we used differences in behaviours expressed in the arena test to speculate on the aversiveness of the human, relative to the dog and goat. The behavioural responses of individual sheep were measured during a 10 min exposure to one of the stimuli, and differences between treatment groups were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis test on ranked data (P < 0.01). An integrated index of fear-related behaviour was also calculated for each animal (fearfulness score). When the dog was present, test sheep stayed furthest from the group sheep, were highly vigilant and explored very little. The distance maintained from the group sheep was intermediate and similar with the goat and human, as were vigilance and exploration. However, while sheep often sniffed the goat, they rarely sniffed the human. The fearfulness scores indicate that the human elicited more fear-related behaviour than the goat (P < 0.001). The results of this experiment suggest that the arena test is an appropriate tool to test the relative aversiveness of different stimuli for individual sheep, that the dog was the most aversive stimulus presented, and that the human may have been slightly more aversive than the goat.

Applying the reaction norm concept on groups, our study addresses both of these aspects in one framework and within an animal's natural social environment. Risk-taking behaviour in 1-year-old perch Perca fluviatilis was assayed in aquarium experiments before and after the fish were subjected to the presence or absence of a piscivorous predator for 3weeks. To analyse the inter-individual behavioural variation across the repeated measurements, we dissected the behavioural change across the predator treatment into individual constant and plastic components using hierarchical mixed-effects models. During the predator treatment, juvenile perch increased in boldness and decreased in vigilance, the magnitude of these behavioural changes was influenced by group composition. However, the behavioural changes were not influenced by the presence of a predator, indicating the difficulties in generating realistic long-term predation pressure in the laboratory. Individuals differed in the relative increase in boldness across the predator treatment and, thus, varied in the shape of their reaction norms. In accordance, the best linear unbiased predictors, extracted from the random effects of separate linear mixed-effects models for the data before and after the predator treatment were only weakly correlated. Hence, between-individual variation seems to change under laboratory conditions and therewith not necessarily represents the initially present natural' variation, giving important implications for the conduction and interpretation of behavioural experiments."

Though behavioral flexibility may allow primates to compensate for injuries, permanent disabilities, such as the loss of a limb, may adversely affect both foraging and locomotory efficiency and ultimately the survival and fitness of individuals. In the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, members of the chacma baboon population (Papio ursinus) experience chronic levels of conflict with humans that manifests in high levels (15%) of disabled baboons in groups that overlap with residential areas. In this study we investigate the potential impact of such disabilities by comparing the behavior and diet of disabled baboons with uninjured baboons matched closely for age, sex, and social status from groups of a similar size and composition for 8 mo, from May to December 2005. Disabled baboons spent more time resting and traveling and less time feeding than uninjured baboons. Disabled and uninjured baboons had similar diets but the former consumed fewer food items with high handling costs and fed more on high return foods than the latter. There was no difference in the frequency of grooming or social vigilance behaviors, as might be expected if disability had compromised either competitive ability or predation risk. Further, there was no difference in the survival of disabled or uninjured individuals in each group. Together these results suggest that while permanent injury may affect the behavior and diet of Peninsula baboons, that these constraints may be offset by access to anthropogenic food sources and the lack of natural predators. Disability in baboons may lead to obligate raiding of high-return anthropogenic foods, which is an important challenge for the ongoing management of this population."

Although a signaller may increase the likelihood of survival for group members, which typically include kin and mates, there are inherent risks associated with any behaviour that increases conspicuousness to predators. Callers can increase their indirect benefits by calling only in the presence of an appropriate audience and manage concomitant costs by judicious investment. Possible tactics for controlling costs include facultative variation in call structure and timing, as well as sensitivity to the environmental and social factors that predict personal vulnerability. We examined individual variation in the alarm-calling behaviour of male fowl in naturalistic social groups. Previous studies of cost management have focused on variation at the level of alarm call rate. We took advantage of recent advances in wireless sound recording and remote video monitoring to test for more subtle variation in signal structure and timing. These were then mapped onto individual mating success and moment-to-moment changes in environmental and social context. Results replicate the previous finding that alarm calling is sensitive to both social rank and recent mating success. In addition, we detected systematic variation in call structure as a function of personal vulnerability and proximity to a rival male. The frequency bandwidth of alarms was reliably influenced by degree of vigilance prior to calling, suggesting that this acoustic dimension reflects motivational state. Taken together, these results reveal several novel tactics for risk management, complementing those previously described at the level of gross variation in alarm-calling behaviour.

Carbon dioxide production for all birds averaged 7.67 +/- 1.29 mL g(-1) hr(-1) (n = 27), equivalent to 90.1 +/- 15.0 kJ day(-1). Carbon dioxide production did not differ between males and females within the same pair measured over the same period. Ratio of daily energy expenditure to basal metabolic rate (BMR) for Ovenbirds (3.4) was closer to the mean value derived for aerial foragers (3.8) than that for ground foragers (2.3) in a sample of passerines feeding nestlings. High daily energy expenditure for Ovenbirds may be related to their relatively brief breeding season in northern climates and their use of cool, closed-canopy forests. Although daily energy expenditure for Ovenbirds was high when compared to other ground-foraging passerines, most individuals were not working near the hypothetical maximum of 4X BMR (Drent and Daan 1980). Daily energy expenditure for Ovenbirds feeding young was greater in large forests than small forests, although the difference was not statistically significant. We speculate that time used for foraging (and hence energy expenditure) may be lower in small forests as a result of increased prey density, or alternatively, greater risk of nest predation in forest fragments leads to greater vigilance at the nest site and less time available for foraging. Further studies of avian energetics in large and small forests, including detailed time-activity budgets, may reveal hidden costs of forest fragmentation."

Unregulated recreational vehicles in coastal wetlands can cause detrimental impacts on coastal avifauna. There is a dearth of information especially in the South Asian context on the impact of recreational disturbance to waterbirds that can inform the management of wetland destinations. This study examined the response of selected water birds to motor vehicles using multispecies experimental disturbance trials conducted at Bundala National Park, Sri Lanka; a Ramsar-listed wetland of global importance. The selected species had significantly different sensitivities to disturbance caused by motor vehicles (log-rank test, chi(2) = 51.7, P < 0.05). The probability of a bird responding to a moving vehicle parallel to the bird at a distance of 75 m was greater than 0.6 for all selected species (Calidris minuta, Charadrius alexandrinus, Himantopus himantopus, Limosa limosa, Platalea leucorodia and Mycteria leucocephala) except Hydroprogne caspia. Resting birds appeared to be more affected by recreational disturbance when compared to foraging birds. Larger birds (height of adult bird: 80-105 cm) were more sensitive to recreational stimuli, compared to smaller birds (10-20 cm). In general, responses of birds for recreational stimuli, were prominent up to 100 m from the source. Selected waterbirds showed longer response distances in habitats exposed to high vehicle traffic activity suggesting possible habituation of birds to recurring disturbance. Our findings suggest a minimal setback buffer of 100 m needs to be employed to manage recreational disturbance from motor vehicles at Bundala National Park."

The abundance of adequate sleeping sites is thus essential for the survival of primates. We investigated microhabitats around sleeping sites, and the influence of habitat degradation on sleeping site choice and usage, in the nocturnal Sahamalaza sportive lemur, Lepilemur sahamalazensis. We used quarter point sampling (N = 315) to describe five forest fragments and 57 sleeping sites and continuous focal animal sampling (N = 45) to determine the diurnal activity budget, to determine whether individuals inhabiting different fragments or sleeping site types showed different levels of vigilance. Our results suggest that tall trees with large crowns, a high density of small trees, and dense canopy are particularly important for sleeping site choice. Microhabitat structure around sleeping sites did not differ between forest fragments or sleeping site types. Diameter at breast height, crown diameter, canopy cover, and bole height were similar for all sleeping trees, as were the number of lianas in trees with tree-tangle sleeping sites, and the volume of tree holes. Tree holes used as sleeping sites were most often found in dead trees of Bridelia pervilleana (50-62.5 %), whereas tree tangle sites were most often located in Sorindeia madagascariensis (20-62.5 %). Lemurs were active 5-14 % of the daytime, although they never left their sleeping sites or fed. Individuals occupying tree holes had higher levels of activity than those in tree tangles, and those in more degraded fragments were more active. Our results suggest that Sahamalaza sportive lemurs choose their sleeping sites according to specific habitat characteristics, and that factors associated with old and intact forest are likely to be crucial for their survival."

Attack success was modelled as a function of biological and environmental variables using observations made during a long-term monitoring. The overall attack success was 28.2%, based on 110 attack observations recorded between 1985 and 2008 in south-eastern Spain. Group size of prey was the most explicative independent variable, indicating that the probability of attack success declined with increasing prey group size. Surprise was the main and most successful attack mode, mainly on preys foraging on the ground. The probability of success in surprise and non-surprise attacks probably declined with prey group size due to the effects of vigilance and confusion, respectively. The best model for attack success also suggested that attacks were more likely to be successful when directed at prey in areas with low bush canopy cover. This finding highlights the importance of open habitat types which provide foraging opportunities for the Bonelli's Eagle. Management measures for increasing open habitats in territories may create a habitat structure more favourable for prey detection by Bonelli's Eagles."
"Klich, Daniel; Grudzien, Magdalena",Selective use of forest habitat by Bilgoraj horses,BELGIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,143,95,105,,2013,"Primitive horses are quite often kept in nature reserves with access to the forest, which they sometimes penetrate to use the vegetation. Horses, as grazers, use specific foraging and anti-predator strategies that differ from typical browsers. The aim of the study was to assess the factors influencing the pattern of forest use by Bilgoraj horses. We hypothesized that the essential factors influencing their pattern of foraging are: browse abundance, distance to pasture, and openness of the habitat. Data were collected at the Bilgoraj Horse-Breeding Centre near Janow Lubelski, Poland. The horses browsed significantly more on woody vegetation in parts of the forest more exposed to sunlight and more abundant in browse material (especially containing preferred species). Distance to the main pasture had a significant effect upon browsing intensity only when an interaction with the abundance of preferred browse was considered."
"Soler, M.; de Neve, L.; Macias-Sanchez, E.; Perez-Contreras, T.",Great spotted cuckoos respond earlier to the arrival of feeding foster parents and perform less erroneous begging when hungry than their magpie host nest-mates,JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY,50,,,10.1111/jav.01952,2019,"In many bird species, parents usually feed the first nestling that starts to beg before its nest-mates. The pressure to avoid missed feeds could trigger nestlings to perform in erroneous begging in absence of parents, which has the same costs as begging in the presence of parents but without any reward. So, nestlings should try to minimize both erroneous begging and missed feeds simultaneously. The threshold to start begging is predicted to be lower for hungry nestlings and for nestlings that are unrelated to their nest-mates, because they suffer lower inclusive fitness costs when depriving nest-mates of food. In line with this idea, we found that brood parasitic great spotted cuckoo nestlings responded sooner than their magpie nest-mates when an adult arrived to the nest. Under laboratory conditions, nestlings of both species rarely incurred in erroneous begging when food was abundant, but under conditions of restricted food, magpie nestlings increased erroneous begging while cuckoo nestlings did not. Highly conspicuous begging in cuckoos results in an increased predation risk, which could have resulted in stronger selection pressures on cuckoos to avoid erroneous begging, probably resulting in better developed perceptual abilities, allowing cuckoos to perform better than their host nest-mates."

Here, we explore the effect of moonlight on the movement and hunting behaviour of African lions. Previous studies found bright moonlight is associated with reduced hunting success; however, those studies were largely undertaken in open habitats where predators are easily seen by prey species on moonlit nights. In this study, we explored whether moonlight affected hunting behaviour and success in a largely wooded environment. Measures of short-term lion movements (distance moved, displacement and path tortuosity) derived from GPS telemetry data were used as indicators of movement behaviour. Field observations of belly distension were used to assess recent food intake. Lions had greater belly distension (indicating feeding success) on dark nights. However, this change in feeding success was not reflected by lion movement patterns-there was no evidence that these changed across moon phases. There was no evidence that lions used more covered habitats on brighter nights to facilitate concealment."

A survey of the distribution, population dynamics, flock size and behavior was conducted in Altun Mountain National Natural Reserve from September to November 2011. We investigated the size and distribution of its population in this area with a sample spot survey and by direct counting. We found Black-necked Cranes on the wetlands of Wuzunxiaoer, Yusup Aleksei, Yaziquan, Qimantag, Tula Ranch and elsewhere, where we recorded 126 individual birds of the species in Yixiekepati (37[degree] 15'-37[degree]23'N, 90[degree]11'-90[degree]20'E, elevation 3903 m), the largest population we have observed in this area. In the reserve, the population consists of about 180-200 birds. Combined with previous records, we conclude that more than 260 Black-necked Cranes live in Xinjiang. Cranes gathered conspicuously in the middle of October where the highest number of birds appeared on 29 October. All of the cranes had migrated out of this area by 6 November. Time budgets and diurnal behavior rhythms of Black-necked Cranes were observed in the Yixiekepati wetland at daylight (from 06: 00 to 18: 00). Foraging was the most prevalent type of behavior during the autumn period, accounting for 58.9% of the diurnal time budget, followed by preening (13.2%), vigilance (9.5%), walking (8.2%), flying (3.5%), resting (3.4%), chirping (2.7%) and other types of behavior (0.6%)."

The tamarins chose sleeping boxes that offered the most concealment, the greatest distance from the floor, and the greatest cover overhead. They did not, however, avoid sleeping boxes that were attached to the floor via vines. When the tamarins had no choice but to sleep in a box that offered little in the way of concealment, they increased their rates of vigilant scanning. Whereas a number of considerations other than those related to predation pressures must also affect sleeping site choices, we have demonstrated that, under controlled circumstances, these primates choose to sleep in locations in which they are hidden and inaccessible."
"Gamero, Anna; Kappeler, Peter M.",Always together: mate guarding or predator avoidance as determinants of group cohesion in white-breasted mesites?,JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY,46,378,384,10.1111/jav.00544,2015,"Being a member of a cohesive group can have fitness benefits such as decreased predation risk, increased feeding efficiency as well as enhanced access to social information and mates. However, competition and the risk of parasite transmission exert centrifugal forces on group-living. Thus, the actual degree of cohesion is expected to vary as a function of the relative importance of several social and ecological factors. White-breasted mesites Mesitornis variegata are medium-sized ground-dwelling birds endemic to the dry deciduous forests of western Madagascar. They live in stable breeding pairs or small family groups, mate monogamously and often form temporary heterospecific associations with canopy-dwelling bird species that give alarm calls to which mesites respond with anti-predator behaviours. We investigated the potential effects of predation risk and mate defence on mesite group cohesion by analysing inter-individual distances of 20 groups as a function of mesite social organization, alarm call events, the size of associated heterospecific flocks, and the adults' reproductive state. Mesite social units were very cohesive, particularly in families, when associated with smaller heterospecific flocks, and after an alarm call event. Adult reproductive state did not influence breeding partners' cohesion. Therefore, the pronounced group cohesion in mesites seems to be mainly a response to the high predation risk typically associated with a terrestrial life-style, and not to mate-guarding. However, we suggest that high group cohesion due to predation risk could limit opportunities for solitary extra-territorial forays to obtain extra-pair copulations, thereby contributing to a strictly monogamous system in this species."

We examined the effects of nest exclosures on the behaviour of incubating Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus melodus Ord, 1824) and their predators on nesting beaches in eastern Canada. Using a combination of field observations, video monitoring, and an artificial nest experiment, we found that adult incubation behaviour did not differ between exclosed and unexclosed nests. Predators, however, visited exclosed nests more often than unexclosed nests and spent more time in the vicinity of exclosed nests than unexclosed nests at one of our sites. These findings suggest that concerns over increased adult mortality and nest abandonment are plausible and require further study."

A total of 122 species, both passerines and non-passerines, were observed in flocks. Individual flocks comprised 2-21 species and 2-237 individuals, with small, insectivorous birds dominant. Although flock composition was largely undifferentiated, six broad groups of mixed-species flocks were identified, their similarity driven by a few key species. Our study found that mixed-species flocks are a common component of the tropical savannas and are similar in individual bird abundance and richness compared with studies in other biomes. One important next step is to examine the relationship of mixed flocks to the entire species pool, and their ecological significance within tropical savannas."

We experimentally investigated the testosterone-sensitive behaviours in male greylag geese (Anser anser) by implanting silastic tubes containing crystalline testosterone during the mating season (February; 5 implanted and 5 control males) and in the early winter (November; 7 and 7). Focal animals were part of a semi-tame, unrestrained flock with fully intact social relationships. Excreted testosterone and corticosterone immunoreactive metabolites (TM, BM) were determined by enzyme immunoassay. Individual faecal samples and behavioural protocols were collected daily over a period of 5 weeks, including 1 control week before implantation. In February, no significant behavioural effects of the supplemental testosterone were observed, which may be due to the naturally occurring high systemic androgen levels in spring. In November, however, implanted males had higher TM excretion rates and performed status signalling behaviour (beak up) more frequently than control males. No differences between implanted and control males were found with respect to BM, agonistic interactions or vigilance behaviour. Furthermore, during the second week after implantation, TM positively correlated with the frequency of beak up of implanted males, whilst their female partners were attacked with lower latency by other members of the flock than the females of control males. Hence, status signalling in greylag ganders seems to be testosterone-sensitive year-long and inappropriate status signalling of males may draw attacks towards their females."

Specifically, stressed or otherwise more aroused individuals will produce alarm calls that are relatively more nonlinear (i.e. they sound noisier). The position of an individual in a social network can influence an individual's sense of security. More centrally located individuals may feel more secure and thus we might expect that they would produce noisier calls. Building on previous research about the influence of social relationships on an individual's sense of security, we asked whether social network position explained variation in the noisiness (quantified as Wiener entropy) and goodness of pitch of alarm calls produced by trapped yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. More socially isolated individuals, characterized by lower outstrength, produced alarm calls with higher entropy and higher goodness of pitch. These isolated individuals may be more aroused because they have fewer social partners to depend on when presented with a predatory threat; therefore, they produce both noisy and potentially louder calls. Additionally, individuals with higher outcloseness produced calls with higher goodness of pitch, which may be indicative of their ability to better inform neighbours of impending threats. Overall, this study further illustrates how an individual's social network position influences the structure of its alarm calls, which could reflect how individuals perceive their current safety levels.

We predicted that reproduction would increase approach distances in pregnant females (because they are burdened with eggs and thus less able to escape rapidly), but reduce them in males (because of lower vigilance due to males focusing on mate-searching rather than predator detection). Field data on approach distances of keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii, Natricinae, Colubridae) supported both of these predictions. We walked the same 1.3-km transect along a dam wall in tropical Australia on 135 nights, and recorded the distances at which snakes fled from our approach. Locomotor speeds were measured for a subset of these animals. Variations in approach distance due to season, weather conditions, prior capture history and snake body size were minor, but reproduction strongly affected approach distances for snakes of both sexes. Gravid females were slower than non-gravid females, and fled at greater distances. Reproductive status did not affect locomotor speeds of males, but males that were reproductive (i.e., contained sperm) permitted closer approach than did non-reproductive adult males. Reproduction thus affected approach distances in snakes of both sexes, but in opposite directions and for different reasons."

Consequently, head movements have been used as indicator of fixation behavior (where gaze is maintained). However, studies on head movement behavior have not elucidated the degree to which birds use high-acuity or low-acuity vision. We studied how European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) used high-acuity vision in the early stages of visual exploration of a stuffed cat (common terrestrial predator), a taxidermy Cooper's hawk (common aerial predator), and a stuffed study skin of a conspecific. We found that starlings tended to use their high acuity vision when looking at predators, particularly, the cat was above chance levels. However, when they viewed a conspecific, they used high acuity vision as expected by chance. We did not observe a preference for the left or right center of acute vision. Our findings suggest that starlings exposed to a predator (particularly cats) may employ selective attention by using high-acuity vision to obtain quickly detailed information useful for a potential escape, but exposed to a social context may use divided attention by allocating similar levels high-and low-quality vision to monitor both con-specifics and the rest of the environment."

Alert distance in the habitat with higher levels of human activity was significantly shorter than the alert distance in the habitat with lower levels of human activity. Overall, the alert distance did not differ between the approach by a human alone and the approach by a human with a dog; however, in the high human activity sites (but not the low human activity sites), the presence of the dog increased alert distance in the squirrels. In addition, squirrels tended to initially respond by running more in the high human activity sites, but the presence of the dog increased the number of squirrels whose initial responses were to not run. Our results suggest that Eastern Gray Squirrel antipredator behavior, at least in response to humans and hunian-associated animals, is influenced by the level of human activity in the surrounding habitat."

These isolated individuals may be more aroused because they have fewer social partners to depend on when presented with a predatory threat; therefore, they produce both noisy and potentially louder calls. Additionally, individuals with higher outcloseness produced calls with higher goodness of pitch, which may be indicative of their ability to better inform neighbours of impending threats. Overall, this study further illustrates how an individual's social network position influences the structure of its alarm calls, which could reflect how individuals perceive their current safety levels.

Due to the lack of monitoring programs, little is known about the ecology and biology of these reintroduced populations. We present the first observations on a reintroduced breeding pair. For 36 months, we examined the breeding behavior of a pair of condors in a nest cave in the central Andes of Colombia. In June 2013, we observed a chick of about 6-7 months of age in the nest cave. The most remarkable outcomes of these observations are (1) that females spend more time guarding the chick whereas (2) males focus on guarding the nest cave. While the chick was in the nest cave (80 h of observations), the female was present in the vicinity of the nest cave and attended the chick for a longer time period than the male. However, in the absence of a chick or eggs (880 h of observations), the male was observed more often in the vicinity of the nest cave than the female. Nevertheless, we found no significant differences in vigilance patterns between the sexes. Intraspecific interactions of the Andean Condor with other raptors in the area were recorded during the observation period of this study. We make some predictions on the timing of reproduction of condors based on this reintroduced pair in Colombia and compare them with those reported elsewhere. Tracking released populations of condors is essential to ensure the positive impact of reintroduction efforts."

At both study areas, nest sites were located at slightly higher elevations (i.e., small platforms of sand) relative to randomly selected nearby unused sites, and nests at each study area also appeared to be situated to enhance crypsis and/or vigilance. Daily survival rate (DSR) of nests ranged from 0.969 to 0.988 among study sites and years, and the probability of nest survival ranged from 0.405 to 0.764. Flooding and predation were the most common causes of nest failure at both sites. At South Island, DSR was most strongly related to maximum tide height, which suggests that flooding and overwash may be common causes of nest loss for Wilson's Plovers at these study sites. The difference in model results between the 2 nearby study sites may be partially due to more-frequent flooding at Sand Island because of some underlying yet unmeasured physiographic feature. Remaining data gaps for the species include regional assessments of nest and chick survival and habitat requirements during chick rearing."

A qualitative method-phenomenological design was adopted to obtain in-depth information. The study group comprised nursing home residents (n = 17), with nine female and eight male residents over the age of 65. The data collected through two focus group interviews were analyzed using MAXQDA 2018-Version 2018. According to the data analysis, sub-codes for the definitions of friendship by the elderly could be separated into five generic categories: behavioral processes (assistance, sharing, boundaries, altruism, and graciousness); cognitive processes (trust, respect, commitment and fidelity, compatibility, and morality); affective processes (intimacy and requirement); structural characteristics (openness, vigilance, reciprocity, and support during good times and bad); and distinctive features (despair, references to the past, health competence, and caregiver as a friend). Although it has been recognized that the elderly offer similar statements as other age groups with regard to the emotional, behavioral and cognitive definitions of friendship, it has been observed that they often refer to the past when they are expressing their friendships and that establishing and maintaining friendships depend on their health status and capabilities. Establishing a friendship with the caregiver is a remarkable characteristic of this period. The results of this research, which aimed to examine the friendship dynamics of the elderly, can be a resource for researchers who discuss the theory of friendship and aging and can be used as a source for the development of elderly care, social support services, and preventive mental health programs for the elderly."

Godwits preyed exclusively on polychaete worms ranging from 2-9 cm in length. Densities of foraging gulls were similar at the three sites, at 30.0, 26.4 and 27.4 birds/ha. but godwit densities were dissimilar, at 26.4, 2.9 and 1.0 birds/ha. Frequencies of prey stealing attempts by gulls were 0.7, 0.23 and 0.70 per 10 min of godwit foraging time and were not related to the relative densities of gulls and godwits, nor to differences in the rates at which godwits caught prey. The godwits lost 0.6%, 0.1% and 1.0% of their prey to the gulls and 3.0%, 0.2% and 2.5% of their foraging time through increased vigilance and avoidance of gulls. It was concluded that the gulls did not have a significant effect on the foraging efficiency of the godwits."

This is the first study of nonbreeding Marbled Teal, the most primitive member of the pochards (tribe Aythyini). Like other Aythyini, Marbled Teal pair relatively late: only 35% of individuals were paired by mid-March. Feeding was mainly nocturnal, and less than 2% of daytime was spent feeding from November to March. Feeding behaviour was similar to that of dabbling ducks (tribe Anatini). A steady increase in swimming activity from October to March was related to increased courtship activity and raptor-avoidance behaviour. Teal selected areas close to the shoreline and avoided open water. Selection of shoreline habitats and distance to shoreline covaried with month and behaviour type. The Marbled Teal is an aberrant pochard with a stronger ecological affinity with the Anatini."

However, alarm calling may attract the predator's attention and, to avoid this cost, animals can opt for alternative strategies to indicate danger, such as 'adaptive silence', which is the cessation of vocalizations. We investigate here whether abrupt contact call cessation would provoke alarm responses, or would reinforce the signal given by an alarm call. In an aviary setting, we conducted playback experiments with a group-living passerine, the Swinhoe's white-eye, Zosterops simplex. We found that birds did not respond to a sudden call cessation, nor did they have a stronger response to alarm calls followed by silence than to alarm calls followed by contact calls. Confirming previous work investigating contact call rate, it appears that in this species contact calls encode information about social factors but not environmental conditions."

Little is known regarding the impact of different types of noise on community level predator perception and breeding behaviour. Here, we presented a predator model alone or a predator combined with a specific noise type, such as traffic, a lawnmower or a chainsaw, to breeding pairs of great tits, Parus major, giving them the opportunity to perform mobbing behaviour that could provide public information to their neighbours. We then measured the provisioning behaviour of adjacent tit pairs, which were 50-150 m away from the focal pairs' nests. The adjacent breeding pairs decreased nest visits when focal birds were exposed to the sparrowhawk model or to the sparrowhawk model combined with the lawnmower noise. Neighbouring pairs did not reduce the rate of nest visits when focal birds were exposed to the hawk model combined with the traffic or the chainsaw noise. The distance from focal nests did not alter the noise effect on neighbouring pairs. We suggest that auditory masking is the most likely mechanism to explain why noise compromises public information. The chainsaw and traffic noise overlap with the frequency of mobbing calls and disrupt the transmission of auditory signals in the community. Further, when the hawk presentation was combined with the chainsaw noise, which was the type of noise that had the highest frequencies, the latency of mobbing by the focal birds was strongly increased, and the number of species involved in mobbing was reduced. This study demonstrates that the signalling function of mobbing is ineffective in noisy environments which ultimately impacts fitness via increased predation to adults or their offspring.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Prey perception of predation risk and antipredator responses may increase in the presence of dependent offspring. We conducted a camera trap study during summer 2015 in North Carolina and Tennessee, USA to evaluate temporal avoidance of a predator (coyote Canis latrans) by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We analyzed activity patterns of bucks, does, and nursery groups (i.e., groups that included fawns) relative to those of coyotes to determine the coefficient of overlap (Delta) using a kernel density estimator. We found that bucks and does had similar Delta with coyotes [Delta(1) = 0.729 (0.629-0.890) and Delta(1) = 0.686 (0.558-0.816, respectively] and exhibited crepuscular activity patterns comparable to those of coyotes. However, nursery groups displayed a dramatically different activity pattern: unimodal activity was concentrated in the middle of the day with little overlap with coyote activity [Delta(1) = 0.362 (0.176-0.491)]. Because adult deer are rarely prey for coyotes, whereas fawns are common prey during summer, the shift in activity patterns of nursery groups demonstrates a behavioral shift likely aimed at avoiding coyote predation on fawns."

We found termite consumption to be generally greater in larger than smaller groups throughout the year, but only significantly so during the dry months, March and April. Individuals in all group categories utilized termites throughout the year, but consumption was low at the end of winter, a time when general insect abundance is high. We conclude that termitophagy is important to individuals living in large groups, particularly during the dry period of the year, most probably to reduce intragroup competition for food."
"Frid, Alejandro; Dill, Lawrence M.",Human-caused disturbance stimuli as a form of predation risk.,Conservation Ecology,6,,,,2002,"A growing number of studies quantify the impact of nonlethal human disturbance on the behavior and reproductive success of animals. Although many are well designed and analytically sophisticated, most lack a theoretical framework for making predictions and for understanding why particular responses occur. Behavioral ecologists have recently begun to fill this theoretical vacuum by applying economic models of antipredator behavior to disturbance studies. In this emerging paradigm, predation and nonlethal disturbance stimuli create similar trade-offs between avoiding perceived risk and other fitness-enhancing activities, such as feeding, parental care, or mating. A vast literature supports the hypothesis that antipredator behavior has a cost of other activities, and that this trade-off is optimized when investment in antipredator or behavior tracks short-term changes in predation risk. Prey have evolved antipredator responses to generalized threatening stimuli, such as loud noises and rapidly approaching objects. Thus, when encountering disturbance stimuli ranging from the dramatic, low-flying helicopter to the quiet wildlife photographer, animal responses are likely to follow the same economic principles used by prey encountering predators. Some authors have argued that, similar to predation risk, disturbance stimuli can indirectly affect fitness and population dynamics via the energetic and lost opportunity costs of risk avoidance. We elaborate on this argument by discussing why, from an evolutionary perspective, disturbance stimuli should be analogous to predation risk. We then consider disturbance effects on the behavior of individuals-vigilance, fleeing, habitat selection, mating displays, and parental investment-as well as indirect effects on populations and communities. A wider application of predation risk theory to disturbance studies should increase the generality of predictions and make mitigation more effective without over-regulating human activities."

Crested Francolin form male coalitions following the breeding season in May. Young males leave their natal coveys and join old males in these coalitions, which are not based on kinship and consist of up to nine members. These coalitions are joined by a young female from June to October, followed by the breeding season when pairs replace coalitions. The coalition is a prelude to successful mating. The single female calls in the coalition, which triggers a cacophony, and her presence often erupts in physical conflicts between males. This cacophony is interpreted as signal jamming where males prevent one another from forming a duet with the female, clearly showing competition between them for winning over the female for mating. A well-synchronised duet forms the basis of pair formation. Old females are not particularly selected for pairing. The coalition is also a surrogate covey for young males because it optimises predator surveillance. The pair bond also optimises predator surveillance for each other throughout the year."

We quantified variation in body mass of male Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus (L., 1758)) on coastal wintering areas prior to spring migration, as well as on breeding grounds, to determine when and where nutrients were acquired to meet costs of reproduction. Male mass on wintering grounds increased, on average, by 45 g (7%) in the weeks prior to migration. On breeding streams, we inferred that body mass of paired males decreased with the length of time on breeding grounds. Also, on average, male mass was considerably lower on breeding streams than when they departed coastal wintering sites. We conclude that males store nutrients on marine wintering grounds for subsequent use during the breeding season. Male Harlequin Ducks are highly vigilant while on breeding streams and the associated reduction in feeding time presumably requires energy stores. We suggest that males have evolved a strategy that is at least partially capital for meeting costs of reproduction, in which they acquire an optimal amount of energy reserves prior to spring migration and subsequently invest them in behaviours that can enhance reproductive success."

We studied behavior of Asian elephants (Elephas Maximus) in the Valparai plateau, a 220 km2 landscape matrix of rainforest fragments, tea, coffee, and Eucalyptus plantations in the Anamalai Hills of the Western Ghats of India. We studied the nearest neighbor distance among elephants within the herd and their feeding behavior in habitat mosaics. We also recorded reactions of elephants to human proximity and number of people in the vicinity. We employed scan sampling for data collection. Feeding by elephants was lowest in open canopy habitat of tea, and it gradually increased in canopy covered plantations of coffee and Eucalyptus and in densely covered natural vegetation. Vigilance behavior of elephants was lowest in forest fragments and riverine vegetation as they could avoid encountering humans. This behavior peaked in tea plantations due to intense human activity there. Elephants maintained closer inter- individual distances in tea and this distance gradually increased in canopy habitats of coffee, Eucalyptus and natural vegetation. More humans in the vicinity and closer proximity to elephants reduced feeding and increased agitation in elephants, while proximity to settlements did not have any infuence. We, therefore, suggest that protection and non-conversion of canopy habitats, restoration of rivers with native species, and maintaining distance from elephants would foster normal activities of elephants and help promote human-elephant coexistence in such landscapes."

The prey is assumed to have different anti-predator behaviors for each predator. Anti-predator behavior can result in one or both predators having positive effects on the fitness of the other. Positive short-term effects (on a behavioral time scale) can be produced by three mechanisms: (1) A behavior that defends against one predator may make the prey more vulnerable to the other; (2) Increased defensive behavior against one predator may increase the cost of defense against the other, resulting in a reduction in the latter defense; (3) If the prey constantly employs some anti-predator behavior, an increase in one behavior can only come at the expense of a reduction in another. The long-term effect of one predator on another is more likely to be negative than is the short-term effect, due to reduction in prey density. However, a strongly positive short-term effect and a prey population that is weakly affected by predator density, can produce a positive long-term effect. Even when both short- and long-term interactions between predators are competitive, the prey's behavior often reduces the ratio of inter- to intra-specific competition between the two predators, promoting their coexistence."

We expected that attachment of collars would increase rates of grooming behaviors and alter patterns of space use. Frequency of grooming was >3 times higher following attachment of radiocollars on captive rabbits; however, the grooming rate declined rapidly and returned to within 5% of pre-collaring levels after 7 days. Free-ranging rabbits exhibited relatively longer distance movements immediately following and during the 2 weeks after capture and attachment of radiocollars, but those movements decreased during weeks 3-4 post-collaring. Rabbits also shifted use areas away from capture locations. Our results suggest that: 1) rabbits became habituated to the presence of collars with respect to grooming; and 2) although, magnitude of movements following capture and collaring in the field attenuated with time, some animals continued to avoid capture areas up to 4 weeks after collaring. A better understanding of potential effects of telemetry on wildlife can help to improve the quality of data collected, design ways to mitigate the impacts on animals, and enhance the ethical conduct of wildlife research.

We tested the hypothesis that the alarm calls communicate risk of predation. We quantified the relationship between predator distance and type of alarm call via human approaches to gerbils. We also tested responses of focal adults in family groups to playback broadcasts of the different calls and controls of bird song and tape noise. Results showed that alarm calls were related to distance from a predator. Gerbils gave the rhythmic call when the predator was farthest away, the more intense call as the predator moved closer; and a short whistle when startled by a close approach of the predator. Gerbils stopped feeding and stood vigilant in a frozen alert posture in response to playbacks of all three alarm calls. They decreased non-vigilant behavior to the alarm vocalizations more than to the controls and decreased non-vigilant behavior significantly more in response to the intense alarm and whistle compared with the rhythmic alarm. We conclude that one function of gerbil alarm calls is to communicate response urgency to family members. The rhythmic alarm communicates danger at a distance, whereas the intense alarm and whistle signal the close approach of a predator."

Producer-scrounger ( PS) models predict that at equilibrium scrounging will increase with group size and with patch richness but will be independent of food patch encounter rate. Earlier PS models assume that foragers arrive instantaneously at scrounged food patches, which is not realistic at the habitat level, at which food patches can be far apart. Here, I develop a spatially explicit model of producing and scrounging in which individuals pay a time cost when travelling to scrounged food patches and may join patches with little or no food left when they arrive. Using a genetic-algorithm approach, I confirm that scrounging increases with patch richness and add several novel predictions. In particular, scrounging is expected to increase with a decrease in food patch encounter rate and can actually decrease when forager density is high. In habitats in which food intake rate increases with the number of foragers at food patches, scrounging at low forager densities is actually predicted to increase success. The spatial model also highlights the self-organizing nature of scrounging. Because scrounging reduces the average distance between foragers, thus reducing the costs of joining, attempts to scrounge make further scrounging more likely to evolve. The spatial model of producing and scrounging provides novel insights into the evolution of group foraging. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Types of different food items and its availability in two habitats were mainly responsible for the variations in activity budgets. We found time spent feeding and resting were significantly higher in the urban group whereas, langurs of the rural group spent more time in moving. There were no significant differences in time spent on grooming and other social interactions. Seasonal variations in all major behaviors were significantly affected by groups. Langurs of both groups spent greater time on feeding and resting in the winter than other seasons while moving was at its peak in the summer.

In this paper, I present a method for training an avian predator which can allow separating between its direct and indirect effects on prey in various experimental setups. Barn owls are found to be a valuable tool for empirically testing different hypotheses related to predator-prey interactions, population dynamics, and inter-specific competition, all performed in the field using authentic rodent prey and their natural predators. Barn owls are raised and trained to participate in field experiments using classical conditioning, and are trained either to catch rodents or only to fly above a certain area without making any attempt to attack the prey, simulating solely predation risk. Body mass is a crucial factor in the training procedure, and I thus define five body mass ranges that characterize different behavioral stages in the training of owls. A logistic model is used to calculate and to predict changes in the body mass during the growth and training periods of owls. Finally, I discuss several possible implications of the usage of trained barn owls in empirical studies."

These strategies can vary depending on the type of predator and level of threat. Although nocturnal predation is a major cause of animal mortality, antipredator behavior at night is poorly understood. To investigate how diurnal animals adjust their antipredator behavior during these different conditions, peahens (Pavo cristatus) were exposed to a taxidermy raccoon during the daytime and nighttime. During the day, the peahens emitted loud antipredator calls, extended their necks upward, adopted a preflight posture, and approached the predator; at night, the peahens emitted soft hissing calls, remained stationary, piloerected their feathers, and raised their tails. The results demonstrate that birds adopt radically different antipredator behavior depending on whether the threat occurs in the daytime or nighttime. These different tactics could result from limitations in sensory abilities.

Receivers should thus vary their responses based on whether a call is likely to be reliable. If capuchins are indeed able to assess reliability, I predicted that receivers will be less likely to respond to alarms that are given during competitive feeding contexts than in noncompetitive contexts, and, within feeding contexts, that individuals inside or adjacent to a food patch will be less likely to respond to alarms than those further from the resource. I tested these predictions in a group of wild capuchins by observing the reactions of focal animals to alarm calls in both noncompetitive contexts and experimental feeding contexts. Antipredator escape reactions, but not vigilance reactions, occurred significantly less often in competitive feeding contexts than in noncompetitive contexts and individuals adjacent to food patches were more likely to respond to alarm calls than were those inside or further from food patches. Although not all predictions were fully supported, the findings demonstrate that receivers vary their behavior in a way that minimizes the costs associated with deceptive alarms, but further research is needed to determine whether or not this can be attributed to counterdeception."
"Beauchamp, Guy",Determinants of false alarms in staging flocks of semipalmated sandpipers,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,21,584,587,10.1093/beheco/arq032,2010,"False alarms occur when animals flee abruptly upon detection of a threat that subsequently proved harmless. False alarms are common in many species of birds and mammals and account for a surprisingly high proportion of all alarms. False alarms are expected to be more frequent in larger groups, where the odds of misclassifying threats are higher, and under environmental conditions where detection of threats is compromised, such as low light levels. In addition, false alarms should be less frequent when the energetic cost of fleeing increases. I examined these hypotheses in roosting flocks of staging semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) over 2 years. False alarms increased with group size but the effect of group size was confounded by the fact that more attacks by falcons (Falco spp.) were directed at larger roosts. False alarms were more frequent at low light levels and later during staging. As individuals double their body mass during staging, the energetic cost of fleeing must greatly increase thus contributing to decreased responsiveness. A simple reduction in responsiveness caused by repeated exposures to harmless signals would also produce a temporal decrease in responsiveness but this hypothesis cannot account for the effect of group size and light level. Study of the determinants of false alarms provides an opportunity to examine adjustments in behavior in relation to changes in perceived predation risk."

These signals may aid the detection of the predator by conspecifics or may deter the predator from attack. The advantages of such signals may be dependent upon predator type and habitat type. We measured signalling behaviours (alarm calling and tail flicking) in foraging chaffinches in response to different predator models (hawk and pigeon control, cat and plastic box as control). In addition we measured responses to a cat model when chaffinches were foraging in different habitat structures (obstructed vs. open). There was no difference in the number of individual chaffinches alarm calling in obstructed vs. open habitat, but birds tail flicked more in open habitat, suggesting that tail flicking acts as a visual signal to the predator or conspecifics and therefore unlike auditory cues is influenced by habitat structure. Chaffinches were also more likely to tail flick in response to the cat model than the other three models. Our results are consistent with the idea that animals may respond to ground predators, which spend a large amount of time observing prey before attack, by using signalling behaviours, such as tail flicking and alarm calling. Further work on prey selection by predators is needed to separate the functions of signalling behaviour in response to predators."

Phenotypic plasticity in male sexual traits is generally assumed to be adaptive, yet its costs are rarely investigated. Male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) adjust their ejaculate production and sexual behavior in response to perceived mating opportunities. In natural populations, mating opportunities can fluctuate continuously, and the iterated activation of plastic responses may impose a cost on males. To determine such costs, we experimentally manipulated male social environment by exposing males either to a constant number of females, or to weekly oscillations in female number. We measured traits linked to condition and reproductive success throughout male life. We found no significant difference in the expression of these traits nor in male lifespan between the 2 groups. Our results suggest that male guppies pay negligible costs for the iterated activation of plastic responses, possibly as a consequence of selection to minimize them."
"Kurvers, Ralf H. J. M.; Wolf, Max; Krause, Jens",Humans use social information to adjust their quorum thresholds adaptively in a simulated predator detection experiment,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,68,449,456,10.1007/s00265-013-1659-6,2014,"Quorum sensing is used in many biological systems to increase decision accuracy. In quorum sensing, the probability that an individual adopts a behavior is a nonlinear function of the number of other individuals adopting this behavior. From an optimal decision-making perspective, individuals should adjust their quorum threshold to the particulars of the decision problem. Recent work predicts that a key factor here is the quality of social information. In particular, it is predicted that individuals should adjust their quorum thresholds such that it lies in between the average true and false positive rate of the other group members. We here test this prediction with a predator detection experiment. First, human groups observed a group of animals (projected on a white screen) in which a predator was present or absent, and each individual made an independent decision to escape or not. Second, individuals received social information on the decisions of their group members, after which individuals decided again. This social information, however, did not represent their own decisions but consisted of responses that either came from a high-performing group (i.e., many individuals detecting the predator) or from a low-performing group (i.e., few individuals detecting the predator). We found that individuals adaptively adjust their quorum threshold to the quality of the social information: when receiving social information from high-performing groups, individuals employed higher quorum thresholds than when receiving information from low-performing groups. Our study demonstrates that humans can quickly evaluate the quality of publicly available information and adaptively adjust their decision rules."
"Kavanau, J. Lee",Roots of avian evolution: clues from relict reproductive behaviors,SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ESSAYS,2,263,294,,2007,"Remarkable, previously little known, relict reproductive behaviors of small parrots are detailed here. Because of the highly conservative nature of brain evolution, neural circuitry for many such primitive behaviors is preserved in functional condition. These behaviors can be elicited by exposing birds to appropriate conditions during breeding cycles. Founded largely on clues from these elicited responses, six main-line avian evolutionary stages are postulated, being described primarily in terms of lifestyles and reproductive practices at each stage. The progression began with small, ectothermic, shallow-nesting theropodan ancestors of birds. In warm, equable Mesozoic climates, the eggs were shallowly covered by dry vegetative debris and incubated solely by climatic heat. The following ectothermic surface-nesting ancestors of Stage 2 maintained sustainedly higher incubative temperatures by appropriately exposing and/or covering eggs with dry or moist vegetative debris, and alternately midday shading them from direct insolation with the parental bodies. Rapid double-clutching became adaptive in Stage 3, with the achievement of primitive endothermy. Higher core and incubative temperatures of Stage 4 and continued rapid double-clutching permitted more annual breeding episodes. In more seasonable early Cretaceous climates, sequential single-clutching again became adaptive in stage 5. Modern birds comprise Stage 6. Mates in Stages 1 and 2 maintained close nest vigilance from nearby, overhead resting sites in vegetation, jumping or parachuting to protect nests from small egg-predators. Pervasive selection for these practices led to skeletal adaptations for arboreality and integumentary adaptations for thermal insulation and increased drag. These practices and their selective effects are the proposed roots of avian evolution. Feathers and flight evolved with continued selection along these lines, with gliding achieved in Stage 3 and sustained wing-flapping flight in stage 4."

Across animal taxa similar combinations of traits seem to prevail, which may have proximate foundation in common neuroendocrine mechanisms. Hitherto, these have been rarely studied in intact social settings. We investigated personalities of greylag goose males from a free-roaming flock that shows complex social relationships. In connection with our longitudinal study on the consistency of behavioural and physiological responses to multiple challenges, we asked whether and how single, personality-related behavioural traits correlate with each other to form personality dimension(s). We tested whether these dimensions were related to physiological characteristics that previously showed limited plasticity (heart rate (HR), baseline and stress-induced excreted immuno-reactive corticosterone (BM), and testosterone metabolites levels) and, furthermore, to age, body measures, and dominance rank. Principal-components analysis based on behavioural variables revealed two factors: 51.1% of variability was explained by aggressiveness and a further 19.1% by sociability. Aggressiveness comprised correlated measures of aggression, subordinance, boldness, vigilance, and proximity to the mate. This aggressiveness positively correlated with stress-induced BM levels, the HR increase during aggressive interactions, and with dominance rank, which may suggest proximate and functional contingencies of this personality dimension."

Such nonlethal predator effects have been abundantly demonstrated empirically in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. But the extent to which changes in species traits alter short-term responses such as growth rate or probability of survival is not clear. Here we develop models to examine the nonlethal effects of predators on prey growth. Our analyses illustrate how the nonlethal effects of predators on individual prey growth depend on environmental context; e.g., factors such as focal species density, competitor density, resource dynamics, and the timescale over which the interactions occur. This context dependence arises because of complex interactions of three mechanisms; (1) the direct negative effect of induced reduction in foraging rates, which is opposed by (2) the potential positive effects of reductions in intra- and interspecific competition, and (3) resource responses to reduced foraging. We present new empirical work, and review previous work, on larval-anuran growth that is in general support of model predictions. The framework presented here can serve to facilitate the design and interpretation of experimental results and predict how the nonlethal predator effect on prey growth in natural systems will vary over time and space."

Litter relocation behavior, in which a female moves her litter to a new location, has been reported for several species of carnivores and rodents but has received little study. We describe litter relocations during long-term studies of two species of ground-dwelling squirrels, yellow-bellied marmots (YBM, Marmota flaviventer) and golden-mantled ground squirrels (GMGS, Callospermophilus lateralis), to determine the distance and frequency of litter relocations and to explore possible explanations for litter relocation behavior. We observed 19 litters relocated by YBM mothers and 32 by GMGS mothers. Although YBM are much larger than GMGS, relocation distances for YBM (median = 46 m and range = 15-324 m) were not greater than those for GMGS (median = 79 m and range = 16-252 m), possibly because YBM home ranges in our study area were exceptionally small. Frequency of litter relocation was greater for GMGS (21% of litters produced) than for YBM (10%), perhaps because GMGS experience fewer social constraints or greater predation risk. We identified several possible costs (energy expenditure and vulnerability to predators while transporting young) and benefits (reduced exposure to predation risk, increased habitat quality, and social benefits) of litter relocation. Future studies should continue to explore litter relocations to better understand the ecological causes and consequences of this behavior."
"Potier, Simon; Bonadonna, Francesco; Martin, Graham R.; Isard, Pierre-Francois; Dulaurent, Thomas; Mentek, Marielle; Duriez, Olivier",Visual configuration of two species of Falconidae with different foraging ecologies,IBIS,160,54,61,10.1111/ibi.12528,2018,"Significant interspecific differences in avian vision occur, even in congeneric species, and these have been correlated with differences in the perceptual challenges associated with foraging. Although diurnal raptors are assumed to be mainly visually guided in their foraging, they differ markedly in their foraging tactics and this may result in different visual demands. Among the Falconidae (Falconiformes), most falcons forage mainly on the wing for highly mobile prey, whereas caracaras forage on the ground for carrion and insects. We assessed whether Saker Falcon Falco cherrug and Southern Caracara Caracara plancus differ in their visual abilities by determining the visual fields and foveal characteristics of both species. Using an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique, we found a higher degree of binocular overlap in the caracaras than in the falcons. The high binocular overlap (47 degrees) of the Southern Caracara may facilitate object manipulation (e.g. moving rocks) when foraging. We used an ultra-high resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography to determine foveal characteristics. We found two foveas (depressions in the retina where high visual resolution is expected) in the falcons (one central and one temporal) but only a central fovea in the caracaras. The presence of a shallower temporal fovea in Saker Falcons may help to fixate visually upon a highly mobile prey item during pursuit. We conclude that these differences in visual field configurations and foveal characteristics reflect different foraging demands, suggesting that the extraction of visual information is finely tuned to the demands of their foraging tactics."

Following young and those in the nursery occurred simultaneously in the same area and population in the highlands of the Negev Desert in southern Israel. The behavior of mothers of young confined in the nursery differed from that of mothers with following young, and among the same individuals before and after their young left the nursery. Females with young confined in the nursery selected richer feeding habitats, spent more time feeding per day, foraged further from escape terrain and in smaller groups than did mothers with following young. Minimizing risk of predation to offspring appeared to be a key constraint on the behavior of mothers with following young."

The use of wetlands by invasive species such as Common myna (Acridotheres tristis), considered as one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world, is largely unknown. Therefore, the Common mynas could have an influence on the occupation of native water bird species. The objectives of this study were to assess Common myna's (1) population size, (2) spatial occupation and (3) characteristics of foraging and roosting sites. Three urban wetlands in Antananarivo were studied: the Tsarasaotra Park, a private site classified as a Ramsar site, the Tsimbazaza Zoological and Botanical Park in the city center, and an area near the Ikopa River, close to the SOCOBIS biscuit factory. In total, 6196 Common mynas were counted with an estimated 7.9 individuals per hectare around the roosting sites. Vigilance and foraging behaviors were less observed when individuals were at a higher stratum, with communication and resting being the most observed behaviors at this level. Only 5.6% of wetlands are used during the day as foraging areas and 1.4% as roosting sites at night, where Common mynas cohabitate with herons and egrets. Finally, the environmental variables collected revealed that Common mynas favor wetlands with tall, wide trees, located far from human disturbance."

Aims: To document the roosting behaviour of the Cattle Egret and assess the relationship between weather conditions and four components of the roosting behaviour including the population size, duration of roost occupancy, the timing of roost gathering and the rate of arrival at roost. Methods: We recorded the number and arrival times of individuals occupying a communal roost site in northeast Algeria in 2013-2014 between December and April. Results: There was a seasonal decline of the flock size and rate of arrival and a seasonal increase in the duration of gathering. Weather conditions affected all variables assessed in roosting behaviour such that bad weather lowered the number of individuals in the roost, lengthened the duration and advanced the timing of gathering, and reduced the rate of gathering in the roost. Conclusion: Our study highlights the importance of weather conditions in shaping the collective roosting behaviour of a gregarious species. Our results suggest that future changes in climatic conditions might influence the collective behaviour of the Cattle Egret in particular and gregarious birds in general."

Benefits can be increased, and costs reduced by preferentially choosing specific locations within a group best adjusted to an individual's needs or by associating with specific group members and/or avoiding others. We investigated the spatial structure of meerkat (Suricata suricatta) groups and whether it was shaped by social factors such as affiliation or aggression among group members, predation risk, foraging success, or a mix of these different factors. Using social network analyses, based on spatial networks, we found associations between the dominant pair, among males and among same aged individuals, and dis-assortment by sex only in one to two of the six groups. In addition, the structure of meerkat groups was highly variable, as individual strength within the calculated networks was not repeatable over time. Meerkats seemed to adjust their location to their physical environment, as dominant individuals were located further toward the front of the group, where foraging success is likely higher and young individuals located further toward the back of the group, where they can benefit most from the vigilance effort of their conspecifics. We conclude that meerkat groups display a dynamic spatial structure depending on both the current social and physical environmental.SignificanceGroup-living animals can achieve greater benefits from close association with conspecifics by choosing specific locations within a group or associating with specific group members and/or avoiding others. A considerable body of work has examined how differences in predation risk or foraging success affect the relative location of individuals within a group. Several studies investigated the association between individuals, in order to draw conclusions on the social structure. However, it is important to disentangle the impact of all of these different aspects on the spatial structure of a group. Here, we provide evidence that both the social and physical environment is important for the spatial assortment of meerkats, a social mongoose foraging in cohesive groups."

This is the first comprehensive study of this neotropical species. The biology of R. nasuta is compared with what is known about the three other species of Rubrica (J. Parker 1929). Females of R. nasuta excavate one-celled nests around 10 cm deep in sandy soils in multispecies aggregations of solitary digger wasps and bees in open areas, like dirt roads. Nesting activities occur in the rainy season from September to April. Females typically dig their nests in the morning. One female in 1992 required 2 hr and 28 min to excavate and complete her nest. During nest closure, she smoothed out the loose soil around the tunnel entrance, effectively disguising it. Provisioning is progressive and takes no longer than 10 days for a single larva (typically around 8 days) with some variation based on weather and prey availability. We estimated about 50 fly prey, especially Syrphidae and Stratiomydae, were required for one larva. From the 3rd day on, it is common in the morning to see a female open her nest, re-enter and exit the nest with uneaten pieces or even an entire prey item held in her mandibles, the so-called discharging behavior. During the dry season, with temperature around 9 degrees C, individual wasps will spend the night in mixed sleeping aggregations on grass inflorescences. Adults were seen taking nectar on plants with tiny flowers. Males patrol nesting sites and exhibit territorial behavior. When digging and provisioning, the females are always very alert against invaders, especially ants. Despite this vigilance, parasitism by a bombyliid fly is very common. Inquilinous miltogrammine flies emerged from R. nasuta nests. This is an interesting finding because members of Miltogramminae are commonly reported as nest parasites of solitary wasps."

Since parrots possess developed communicative and cognitive skills, the study of personality traits is of particular interest. The aim of our study was to develop a reliable and valid temperament test by measuring quantitative behavioural parameters in two genera of medium-sized parrots: the African Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus, n = 15) and the Amazon parrot (Amazona spp., n = 16). We selected a set of 26 behavioural parameters based on a high intra-observer reliability. A principal component analysis was used to establish two reliable and valid temperament traits: anxiety/ vigilance and curiosity/neophilia. Our test meets 5 out of 6 reliability and validity criteria which could be assessed. The two identified traits might be related to those found in other animal species, i.e. neuroticism and extraversion. These traits allowed us to demonstrate differences in the temperament of two species from two different genera: Blue-Fronted Amazon Parrots were significantly more anxious/vigilant and more curious/ neophilic than African Grey Parrots. We found that parrots were more curious/neophilic when the test was repeated after six weeks, suggesting that a brief exposure to the experimental conditions resulted in a process of habituation. However, a further test eighteen months after the initial test revealed a high consistency in the two temperament traits. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an objective observational temperament test applied on two parrot species in order to compare their temperament. We believe that comparison of different avian species' temperament using similar testing procedures opens an interesting avenue of research which could be used to link temperament, phylogenetic and ecological data."

The time and energy required to keep these traits clean, attractive, and in good condition for signaling may represent an important but understudied cost of bearing a sexually selected trait. Male fiddler crabs possess an enlarged and brightly colored claw that is used both as a weapon to fight with rival males and also as an ornament to court females. Here, we demonstrate that males benefit from grooming because females prefer males with clean claws over dirty claws but also that the time spent grooming detracts from the amount of time available for courting females. Males, therefore, face a temporal trade-off between attracting the attention of females and maintaining a clean claw. Our study provides rare evidence of the importance of grooming for mediating sexual interactions in an invertebrate, indicating that sexual selection has likely shaped the evolution of self-maintenance behaviors across a broad range of taxa."

This study combined these three factors into a single visitor impact score and assessed whether visitor impact predicted the frequency or occurrence of displacement activities, affiliative behaviors, and aggression in a group of six captive ebony langurs (Trachypithecus auratus). This study also examined whether the amount of time the ebony langurs spent sleeping each day was correlated to the mean visitor impact score for that day. We used negative binomial and binomial models to analyze data collected during 5-min focal follows. Higher visitor impact scores predicted greater expression of displacement activities, affiliative behaviors, and aggression, suggesting that zoo visitors were a source autonomic arousal for the langurs. Similarly, the langurs spent more time sleeping on days with higher mean visitor impact scores, which may indicate learned helplessness. This study suggests that zoo visitors may be a source of environmental stress for captive ebony langurs. Nevertheless, the positive relationship between high visitor impact score and the occurrence of affiliative behavior types may indicate that the langurs use certain activities to decrease visitor-induced stress."

The role of the foraging behaviour in promoting species coexistence was also examined. We used giving-up densities (GUDs) in artificial food patches to measure the patch use of rodents and video trapping to directly record the foraging behaviour, vigilance, and interspecific interactions. Three potential mechanisms of coexistence were evaluated (1) microhabitat partitioning; (2) spatial heterogeneity of resource abundance with a tradeoff in foraging efficiency vs. locomotion; and (3) temporal partitioning on a daily scale. Compared to M. meridianus, D. sagitta generally possessed lower GUDs, spent more time on patches, and conducted more visits per tray per capita, regardless of microhabitat. However, M. meridianus possessed advantages in average harvesting rates and direct interference against D. sagitta. Our results only partly support the third mechanism listed above. We propose another potential mechanism of coexistence: a tradeoff between interference competition and safety, with M. meridianus better at interference competition and D. sagitta better at avoiding predation risk. This mechanism is uncommon in previously studied desert rodent systems."

One of the chief symptoms of events such as trauma, that overwhelm our capacities to successfully handle and adapt to them, is a shift in our internal baseline reference such that there ensues a repetitive activation of the traumatic event. This can result in high vigilance and over-sensitivity to environmental signals which are reflected in inappropriate emotional responses and autonomic nervous system dynamics. In this article we discuss the perspective that one's ability to self-regulate the quality of feeling and emotion of one's moment-to-moment experience is intimately tied to our physiology, and the reciprocal interactions among physiological, cognitive, and emotional systems. These interactions form the basis of information processing networks in which communication between systems occurs through the generation and transmission of rhythms and patterns of activity. Our discussion emphasizes the communication pathways between the heart and brain, as well as how these are related to cognitive and emotional function and self-regulatory capacity. We discuss the hypothesis that self-induced positive emotions increase the coherence in bodily processes, which is reflected in the pattern of the heart's rhythm. This shift in the heart rhythm in turn plays an important role in facilitating higher cognitive functions, creating emotional stability and facilitating states of calm. Over time, this establishes a new inner-baseline reference, a type of implicit memory that organizes perception, feelings, and behavior. Without establishing a new baseline reference, people are at risk of getting stuck in familiar, yet unhealthy emotional and behavioral patterns and living their lives through the automatic filters of past familiar or traumatic experience."

CCTV provides a socially relevant context for visual attention and search, because it involves dynamic natural images, multiple cameras that are frequently expected to be monitored simultaneously and a range of significant events which are often accompanied by high levels of uncertainty. In recent years, increasing research attention has been paid to operators' cognitive processes in CCTV surveillance. Prior to this, the focus was largely on evaluations of systems for the purposes of developing guidelines for system design. The literature review identified 56 relevant documents. These are discussed in terms of the purpose of CCTV surveillance, the design of the technical system, nature of images, scenes and significant events, and the implications for information processing by operators. Recommendations for future research include, amongst others, context specific research, search strategies and scanning patterns, mechanisms for re-engaging attention after task disengagement, the contribution of active visual analysis, behavioural cues that predict aberrant behaviour. Specific recommendations for practitioners are made regarding translating research findings into practice and enhancing the cognitive surveillance skills of operators."

Adult conspecific chatter and whistle alarm calls were played back to juvenile and adult ground squirrels at an agricultural field site.

To test the evocativeness of juvenile calling, a subset of adult subjects received juvenile chatter and whistle playbacks. Adults spent less time out of view to juvenile call types than to adult calls, and showed more similar responses to juvenile chatters and whistles than to adult chatters and whistles. Age differences in the ground squirrel's alarm call system may reflect adjustments to changing risks during development."

These attempts have resulted in high mortality rates, which we hypothesised are caused by captive-reared birds exhibiting more naive predator avoidance behaviour than wild birds. Captive-reared and wild-trapped Northern Bobwhites were subjected to raptorial and terrestrial predator simulations and their responses were recorded on high definition video. We recorded the time to predator detection, time to anti-predator defence, and reaction type for comparative analysis. Captive-reared birds detected simulated predators quicker than wild-trapped birds, but time to mount an anti-predator defence was not different between groups. The response type, however, was different between groups. Captive-reared birds typically flushed when encountering a simulated predator; yet, wild-trapped birds did not flush at all, and typically ran or held when subjected to the simulated predators. We hypothesise that flushing is a naive anti-predator response that results in revealing of position in the presence of a threat, thereby increasing the individual risk of predation. These results potentially illuminate at least one reason why captive-reared Northern Bobwhite releases have been largely unsuccessful."

We investigated feeding competition in a supergroup of Rwenzori black-and-white colobus monkeys (Colobus angolensis ruwenzorii) in Rwanda, with the aim of establishing whether freedom from scramble competition allows these monkeys to form supergroups. We used the patch depletion method, measuring intake rate coupled with movement rate, to assess if food patches become depleted over the occupancy period. Resource depletion was evident when the colobus fed on young leaves, but not when feeding on mature leaves. Scramble competition was inferred from a negative correlation between group size and change in intake rate over patch occupancy. Between-group contest competition was inferred from displacement from patches. Although feeding competition exists for select resources, limited competition for mature leaves may enable Rwenzori colobus to live in a supergroup of hundreds of individuals in this montane forest."

We extend understandings of the filter bubble to examine the highly reflexive, everyday ways in which filtering is adopted as a practical response to the information saturation and the politicised vulnerability engendered by digital environments. In doing so, we make a case for the necessity of filtering practices to create 'safe spaces' for feminist deliberation, at the same time as questioning whether absolute 'safety' is possible in feminist politics. Drawing on two separate studies of young feminist women who regularly engage with feminist private groups on Facebook, we document significant ambivalence regarding these closed spaces. While feminist filter bubbles were essential for surviving the risks of more open online environments, participants reported complicated feelings of guilt in not moving beyond these bubbles. Maintaining the 'safety' of these spaces also involved significant, ongoing labour in the requirement for participants to customise content within these bubbles, involving vigilant practices of moderation of content and the consistent application of trigger warnings. As such, we question whether the model of the feminist filter bubble is sustainable in the labour it requires already exhausted feminists to perform, and politically capacious enough to allow sustained difficult conversations. We suggest further critical engagement is required to connect filter bubbles to the everyday, affective politics of deliberation on social media platforms."

This study investigated the naturally occurring aggressive interactions during ritualized fights of the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) foraging with Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus). The study was conducted in the first core zone of Dafeng Pere David's Deer National Nature Reserve, Jiangsu, China during the summers of 2012 and 2013. The foraging and vigilance variables of resident cattle egrets feeding with a deer with and without intrusion were calculated and compared. Cases of ritualized fights between residents and intruders were recorded in naturally occurring aggressive interactions. The prey capture success rate and the total foraging earnings of resident cattle egrets following a deer with intrusion were significantly higher than those of resident foragers without intrusion. The resident status did not affect the outcomes of the ritualized fights of the cattle egrets, although adult residents or intruders had more cases of winning in contesting ownership of the deer. Thus, age is the major resource holding factor in foraging cattle egrets competing for host ownership."

The presence or absence of predation is likely to have major effects on the population dynamics of sexually dimorphic ungulates, with contradictory implications for multiple-use reserves, and to provide fundamental insights into predator prey relationships.Over a two- and four-year period we determined the adult sex ratios and juvenile mortality of two substantial populations of impala Aepyceros melampus in South Africa one in predator-free Ithala Game Reserve (IGR), the other in neighbouring predator-laden Illuhluwe-iMfolozi Park (IliP). Data were collected monthly, over a five-day period, by repeated road transects covering a representative sample of the reserves' habitat types. We assessed differences in adult sex ratios by applying Pearson's chi-square test, whilst to explore the relationship between juvenile mortality, the advance of the breeding year, rainfall and the presence or absence of predators, we used a generalized linear model.We found that the impala adult male to adult female ratio was significantly lower in the presence of predation (IliP = 0.43, IGR = 0.69). The generalized linear model revealed that the overall proportion of juveniles in breeding herds (defined as herds containing at least one juvenile) declined, over the breeding year, at a faster rate in the presence of predators. Impala juvenile mortality over the breeding year was not significantly affected by lower rainfall in the absence of predators, but under predation juvenile mortality declined at a faster rate over a drier year compared to years of near average rainfall a. novel finding amongst African antelope,Such fundamental insights into predator prey relationships are especially relevant to predator-free reserves, where management and planners should be aware of these influences and, depending on the business model, consider replicating them artificially."

While the failure to recognise and/or respond to a novel predator has devastating impacts in the short term after predators are introduced, few studies have asked whether medium to long term experience with alien predators enables native species to overcome their naivete. In Australia, introduced dogs Canis lupus familiaris, foxes Vulpes vulpes and cats Felis catus have caused rapid extinctions and declines in small-medium sized native mammals since they were introduced similar to 150 years ago. However, native wildlife have had similar to 4000 years experience with another dog - the dingo Canis lupus dingo. Native bush rats Rattus fuscipes remain common despite predation from these predators. We predicted that prior experience with dingoes would mean that bush rats recognise and respond to dogs, but suspect that hundreds of years experience may not be enough for effective responses to cats and foxes. To test these predictions, we combined the giving-up density (GUD) with analysis of remote camera footage to measure bush rat foraging and behavioural responses to body odour from dogs, foxes, cats and native spotted-tail quolls Dasyurus maculatus. Bush rats responded strongly to dogs with increased GUDs, increased vigilance and decreased foraging. However, mixed responses to foxes and cats suggest that at least some individuals remain naive towards these predators. Naivete is not necessarily forever: alien predators devastate many native prey species, but others may learn or adapt to the new threat."

These effects arise because prey often induce costly phenotypic responses to mitigate predation risk. Yet because predator-prey interactions are complex, prey defenses may vary considerably. We investigated if the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), a reptile apex predator, induced multiscale antipredator responses in key prey, the Rusa deer (Cervus timorensis) and the wild pig (Sus scrofa). To this end, we examined the temporal and spatial partitioning of habitats by predator and prey, determined the size of ungulate groups as a function of risk, and assessed changes in individual behavior of prey individuals exposed to predator kairomones at feeding stations. Komodo dragon, deer, and pig populations exhibited significant, but subtle differences in 3 habitat preferences that otherwise indicated high niche overlap. Komodo dragon predation risk, alongside other commonly considered predictor variables, did not affect deer or pig group size. With the exception of one individual-based vigilance-type behavior in pigs, no other antipredator behavior, including reduced food consumption, significantly varied in the presence of predator odor cue at feeding stations. Overall, our results indicated limited evidence for antipredator behavior and suggested Komodo dragons exert weak nonconsumptive effects of predation in ungulates. However, weak predatory interactions could be beneficial in island ecosystems as it could promote predator-prey coexistence that reduces extinction risk.Apex predators hold important ecological roles through their ability to kill and induce antipredator responses in prey. Against expectation, we provide compelling evidence that the Komodo dragon, the largest lizard predator, induces only weak antipredator responses in key prey-Rusa deer and wild pig. Low and variable energy requirements of Komodo dragons could explain limited antipredator responses. Weak predation, however, probably benefits the persistence and coexistence of Komodo dragon and prey populations on small islands."

We evaluated framework predictions empirically by exposing unsated and sated brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) to visually obstructive (similar to 13-cm vegetation height; tall), higher-risk plots versus unobstructive (<8 cm vegetation height; short) plots, and relative to prey resources. We predicted that 1) unsated birds (unfed since the previous day) would be present in greater numbers and forage more in short than tall vegetation plots 24 h post-mowing because of invertebrate flush resulting from mowing; 2) unsated birds would show increasing numbers and foraging in tall plots >24 h post-mowing because of decreasing food abundance and availability in short plots; and 3) sated birds would be present in greater numbers and forage more in short vegetation overall, because vigilance needs would exceed that of food needs. We evaluated effects of visual obstruction (a metric correlated with both vegetation height and insect density) on behaviours within plots via generalized linear mixed models. Unsated cowbirds showed nearly equal numbers in tall and short plots ((X) over bar [SE] individuals using tall plots: 9.5 [5.1]; short plots: 9.8 [5.1], P=1.00, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test), and foraged nearly equally in both plots 24 h post-mowing (tall plots: 6.9 [4.7] individuals; short plots: 6.6 [4.11individuals, P= 0.94). Prey availability was likely enhanced within short plots within 24 h of mowing, but possibly in adjacent tall plots as well. Over the course of the experiments (8-9 days) unsated cowbirds showed no difference in numbers between plots (tall plots: 8.2 [4.9] individuals; short plots: 11.4 [4.9] individuals, P=0.13), but foraged more in short plots (tall plots: 4.4 [3.8] individuals; short plots: 7.8 [4.2] individuals, P=0.01); visual obstruction was significantly and negatively correlated with foraging in tall plots. Sated cowbirds selected for short plots (use of tall plots: 5.9 [4.2] individuals; short plots: 11.7 [4.6] individuals, P<0.01; foraging in tall plots: 4.1 [3.3] individuals; short plots: 8.2 [4.6] individuals, P< 0.01).

Four robins captured in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, overwintered in Texas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Montana, up to 4,500 km from the capture location. One robin captured in Amherst, Massachusetts, overwintered in South Carolina 1,210 km from the capture location, whereas 2 robins captured in Washington, D.C., spent the entire year within 6 km of their original capture location. Understanding the annual cycle and differences in migration strategies for a species that exhibits large regional variation in movement has the potential to provide novel insights into how conspecific populations respond to current and future heterogeneity in climate and habitat. The region-specific patterns presented here suggest robins could serve as sentinels of environmental change at a continental scale."

It is important to determine what types of enrichment are effective for individual species in captivity. The aim of this research was to test the effect of three different enrichment treatments on the behaviour of cheetahs at Fota Wildlife Park, Ireland. The three treatments; temporal variation in feeding, spatial variation in feeding and olfactory enrichment using scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) faeces were chosen to provide a degree of novelty and unpredictability to the captive environment, with the goal of decreasing pacing while increasing active and exploratory behaviours. Following baseline data collection, treatments were introduced to the five cheetah enclosures according to a schedule, with each treatment being carried out for five days followed by a 14-day post-treatment (PT) period prior to the next treatment being introduced. A Friedmann ANOVA was carried out to test if the schedule of enrichment treatments had an effect on cheetah behaviour. Vigilance behaviour was observed less frequently during treatment and post-treatment phases (4.1-9.5%) compared with the baseline observations (11.1%). Exploratory behaviour fluctuated with the highest level occurring during the olfactory enrichment treatment. There was a trend for pacing to decrease during enrichment treatments. A range of behaviours were also significantly affected at different times of the day by the schedule of treatments. The results were similar to previous enrichment studies on other felids suggesting that the use of these types of enrichment can be an effective form of enrichment for cheetahs in captivity. Individual groups also reacted differently to the enrichment treatments, suggesting that enrichment can have varying effects on behaviour of captive cheetahs depending on group identity and configuration. The schedule of treatments, punctuated by the return to baseline conditions, is also cited as having an enriching effect. Due to different behaviours being affected at different times of day, the question was raised about the use of specific enrichments during periods of time when abnormal behaviour is prevalent. Research on the behavioural effects of a randomised enrichment treatment schedule, rather than a sequential one used in this study may be of benefit, in order to separate the effects of the schedule and the treatments.

The research was undertaken in a study area of 2414 ha with a mean density of 12-40 vicunas/km(2). Captures were conducted on groups of wild vicunas that had not received any prior management. Groups were herded into a funnel system that ended in a corral with several internal subdivisions. Three distinct capture methods were compared, according to the method by which the animals were herded into the corral (vehicles system: vehicles only; mixed system: people on foot and vehicles; and Chaku system: people on foot only). Attempts to escape, alarm calls, increased vigilance, vocalizations, and kicking were measured to quantify the stress response. A total of 478 vicunas were captured between May 2003 and November 2005. Vicunas captures by mixed system showed alert and active behaviours and vocalized more in the handling corral. The most active animals inside the corrals showed higher respiratory and heart frequency during handling (r = 0.44, P < 0.05 and r = 0.58, P < 0.001, respectively) and the heart rate increase was inversely proportional to blood glucose and creatin kinase (CK levels) (r = -0.31, P = 0.05 and r = -0.4, P = 0.05, respectively). Females captured by people on foot showed greater concentrations of cortisol (174 +/- 10.5 nmol/L), compared to vicunas captured by people and vehicles (127.38 +/- 12.5 nmol/L) (F((1,21)) = 7.22, P < 0.05).

This study tested quantitatively for a non-random association between female nest attentiveness and male song output in two ways. First, 11 pairs of wrens were observed for 2 h during their incubation stages and the rime of each male song and each female exit from, and entrance into, the nest cavity was noted. Of the 60 exits observed, 29 (48%) occurred within 30 s of when the male began a song bout near the nest. Overall, female exits followed significantly sooner after the start of male song bouts than expected if exits normally occurred al random with respect to song. Males were also removed temporarily from 12 territories during incubation stages and the nest attentiveness of their females was monitored for 2 h. These experimental females spent, on average, 18% more time in nests than did 11 undisturbed control females (47 vs 40 min/h). This occurred only because experimental females waited longer to exit nests during each attentive period. Experimental females did not take shorter recesses. Females may benefit from waiting to exit nests until their mates are singing nearby because: (1) the male's song indicates to the female that no predators are present, (2) males will be present to guard nests, especially against conspecifics, in the female's absence, and/or (3) males can act as sentinels while females are foraging."

I analyzed habitat use and behavioral time budget data for a Texas population of the Western Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma californica), As a non-cooperative population, one of two habitat-use patterns was expected: (1) specialist habitat-use patterns in an abundant, widespread habitat type, with little variation among territories in habitat composition or (2) generalist habitat-use patterns with the potential of significant variation in habitat composition among territories. These jays show a combination of habitat-use patterns supporting both predictions. The only resources that males utilize as a specialist, tall oak trees during sentinel behavior, are fairly widespread and would not be considered a limiting resource. In the remaining habitat categories, Texas populations of Western Scrub-Jays act as generalists, using the habitat in relation to its availability, even though variation in habitat composition among territories is considerable. Variation among individuals within a sex was observed but could not be explained using various demographic and ecological correlates. Additional detailed habitat use data when used in a comparative framework can aid determination of subtle ecological differences among populations of Western Scrub-Jays and allow closer examination of intrinsic and extrinsic ecological models concerning the evolution and maintenance of cooperative breeding systems in this group."

Rako, or Buller's Shearwater (Ardenna bulleri) is a seabird endemic to New Zealand that breeds only on the Poor Knights Islands, but forages throughout wider areas of the Pacific Ocean during the non-breeding season. The lack of threats on the breeding grounds and the wide foraging range of Buller's Shearwaters makes them ideal sentinels of ocean health. Although they are commonly seen at sea and the population in the 1980s was thought to be around 2.5 million birds, other rapid land-based surveys suggested a much lower figure (similar to 100,000 pairs on Aorangi), and no thorough population estimate has been undertaken to date. We calculated a population estimate for Buller's Shearwater based on burrow counts and state of occupancy conducted at the Poor Knights during either the 2016-2017 or the 2017-2018 breeding seasons. We incorporated information on habitat availability and preference in population models. Our estimate of 78,645 (95% confidence interval 67,176-89,178) active burrows, broadly representing breeding pairs, is lower than some previously published assessments. This is a repeatable quantitative study of the Buller's Shearwater breeding population, including breeding activity, and provides critical baseline data to determine population trends for this potentially important marine indicator species."

Both a higher water vapour conductance and parental favouritism during incubation could explain the shorter incubation period for the B-egg than for the A-egg. Because the incubation period is increased by the presence of a sibling for A-eggs, but not for B-eggs, and because both egg categories have the same incubation period when they are incubated alone, it has been suggested that the difference in incubation period was largely driven by the parental favouritism for B-eggs during incubation. We tested whether A- and B-eggs show a difference in laying density, density at the beginning of incubation and in density decrease during incubation according to the presence of a sibling. Although density at the start of incubation was significantly higher for B-eggs than for A-eggs, the decrease in density during incubation had the same slope for both egg categories. Moreover, the presence of a sibling did not influence densities. We additionally provide two equations that allow the back-dating of laying dates for a clutch of SouthernRockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes c. chrysocome) and we discuss the precision of the method (3.04 +/- A 2.29 days for A-eggs and 2.73 +/- A 2.10 days for B-eggs) for penguins which are increasingly being used as marine environmental sentinels."

A close monitoring of the use of water resources and the status of the vegetation in these ecosystems can be useful tools for maintaining the production of ecological services. This study explores the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) and water stress over a dehesa by integrating remotely sensed data into a water balance using the FAO-56 approach (VI-ETo model). Special attention is paid to the different phenology and contribution to the system's hydrology of the two main canopy layers of the system (tree + grass). The results showed that the model accurately reproduced the dynamics of the water consumed by the vegetation, with RMSE of 0.47 mm day(-1) and low biases for both, the whole system and the grass layer, when compared with flux tower measurements. The ET/ETo ratio helped to identify periods of water stress, confirmed for the grassland by measured soil water content. The modeling scheme and Sentinel-2 temporal resolution allowed the reproduction of fast and isolated ET pulses, important for understanding the hydrologic behavior of the system, confirming the adequacy of this sensor for monitoring grasslands water dynamics."

These applications include the development and validation of new and existing algorithms, understanding of the sensor's performance prior to launch, and trade studies to determine ideal sensor configurations. The accuracy of these applications is dependent on the realism of the modeled scenes and sensors. The Digital Image and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) tool has been used extensively to model the complex spectral and spatial texture variation expected in large city-scale scenes and natural biomes. In the past, material properties that were used to represent targets in the simulated scenes were often assumed to be Lambertian in the absence of hand-measured directional data. However, this assumption presents a limitation for new algorithms that need to recognize the anisotropic behavior of targets. We have developed a new method to model and simulate large-scale high-resolution terrestrial scenes by combining bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, high spatial resolution data, and hyperspectral data. The high spatial resolution data is used to separate materials and add textural variations to the scene, and the directional hemispherical reflectance from the hyperspectral data is used to adjust the magnitude of the MODIS BRDF. In this method, the shape of the BRDF is preserved since it changes very slowly, but its magnitude is varied based on the high resolution texture and hyperspectral data. In addition to the MODIS derived BRDF, target/class specific BRDF values or functions can also be applied to features of specific interest. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the techniques and the methodology used to model a forest region at a high resolution. The simulated scenes using this method for varying view angles show the expected variations in the reflectance due to the BRDF effects of the Harvard forest. The effectiveness of this technique to simulate real sensor data is evaluated by comparing the simulated data with the Landsat 8 Operational Land Image (OLI) data over the Harvard forest. Regions of interest were selected from the simulated and the real data for different targets and their Top-of-Atmospheric (TOA) radiance were compared. After adjusting for scaling correction due to the difference in atmospheric conditions between the simulated and the real data, the TOA radiance is found to agree within 5 % in the NIR band and 10 % in the visible bands for forest targets under similar illumination conditions. The technique presented in this paper can be extended for other biomes (e.g. desert regions and agricultural regions) by using the appropriate geographic regions. Since the entire scene is constructed in a simulated environment, parameters such as BRDF or its effects can be analyzed for general or target specific algorithm improvements. Also, the modeling and simulation techniques can be used as a baseline for the development and comparison of new sensor designs and to investigate the operational and environmental factors that affects the sensor constellations such as Sentinel and Landsat missions."

The movement of their shells and the gap inbetween the valves can serve as indicators of water pollutants entering surface water bodies. This letter proposes a novel sensing system to accurately calculate the valve-gaping angle in bivalves. The sensor unit is comprised of two inertial measurement units for each bivalve to estimate the angle between the two valves. Monitoring of multiple bivalves is possible with several water-insulated sensor units tethered with flexible cables to a central base station housing the processing unit. Miniaturization of the sensor packaging and flexibility of the wires ensured minimum hindrance to the animals' natural behavior. The precision and accuracy of the angle measurement were tested with a benchtop servo motor setup simulating the gaping behavior. The standard deviation of measurements at a steady state was 0.78 degrees, and the average change in measurement during a 10 degrees step was 9.98 degrees. Over 250 h of in vivo validation experiments demonstrated the consistency of the angle measurements using the presented method alongside a magnetic alternative, which had an average correlation coefficient of -0.89. The sensor system provides an accurate study of bivalve gaping behavior and facilitates the potential use of bivalves as environmental sentinels due to their valve-gaping being a biomarker for monitoring water pollution."

The birds preferred feeding in sandy (40%), light eelgrass (33%) and sandy-mud areas (27%). They showed a distinct horizontal distribution when feeding, with 88% on wet substrates above the water's edge and 10% at the water's edge. Two feeding modes were employed: isolated pecks and multiple pecking and probing. Pecks were the primary feeding actions observed during daylight. The alternative feeding mode of bursts of multiple pecks (with occasional probes) was observed close to dusk and inferred from tracks in the mud to be commonly used after dark. The mean duration of feeding periods in intertidal areas was 329.4 minutes per diurnal tidal cycle (s.d. +/- 93.3), although in some circumstances, these periods were supplemented by feeding in non-tidal areas. The mean peck rate of Double-banded Plovers feeding in single-peck mode was 0.41 pecks per second (s.d. +/- 0.17) and, in the multiple-peck mode, 0.22 pecks per second (s.d. +/- 0.04). The most significant prey species from intertidal areas was the Sentinel Crab Macrophthalamus latifrons. The adaptive significance of the feeding behaviour of the birds is discussed in relation to physical constraints on feeding and the behaviour and ecology of their main prey."

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the theoretical treatment of minimum extremes and, specifically, minimum flows. The method has two approaches: i) conventional; ii) asymptotic. In conventional analysis, the Weibull (W2) and Lognormal distributions of two parameters (LN2) were adjusted to the series of annual minimum flows and minimum averages of 7-day flows. In the asymptotic analysis approach two parent distributions, the distributions of all average daily flows, with power behavior for minimum flows, are investigated: i) Gamma; ii) LN2. The theory studied in this paper is applied to 11 gauged stations in the Iguacu river basin with 48-year data series. It was concluded that the LN2 distribution presents the best fit according to the chi(2) test. It was found that the Gamma distribution, with respect to the minimums, tends to a power function, and consequently the W2 distribution. The parameters k, b and mu(X), of the normalized annual minimum flow series are well-fitted to the LN2 distribution. According to both approaches, LN2 can be recommended for studies of minimum flows in the Iguacu river basin."

This study responds to the demand for an ongoing, objective, and transparent assessment of the areal extent of sugarcane grown. I have combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with time-series analysis, image-segmentation, and machine-learning, into a model that detects the annual areal extent of sugarcane in Queensland, since 2004. I then contrasted two variants of the model: one applied at the end of autumn (i.e. May), just before the annual harvest begins, and another applied earlier, in mid-summer (end of January), to help expedite the delivery of information for the current growing season. Both models relied heavily on contemporary land-use mapping, and the behaviour of enhanced vegetation index through summer, to detect accurately. The end-of-autumn model detected sugarcane with a user's accuracy of 93%, and a producer's accuracy of 98%, based on 596 random validation points. In comparison with historical published statistics, the end-of-autumn predictions of areal extent were typically in error by 7.1-10.1% of the observed mean, depending on the spatial scale of interest. The mid-summer model was slightly more volatile, typically in error by 6.8-11.0% of the observed mean. Overall, the results indicate that it is possible to detect-in near-real-time and with reasonable accuracy-the areal extent of sugarcane grown in Queensland in the summer of each year."

Here, we found that unusual environmental conditions in the Terre Adelie sector of Antarctica disrupted the breeding activity of Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae on land - but also their foraging activity at sea - to such a degree that no chicks survived in the 2013/2014 breeding season. Uncommonly heavy precipitation for this normally dry desert killed chicks en masse, while weak katabatic winds maintained a persistent sea ice around the colony, thereby impacting chick provisioning by adults. Extreme events such as this have direct repercussions for the species in question, and may also affect the wider sea-ice dependent food web. Understanding the nature, frequency, and consequences of such events are central to the management and conservation of this remote yet crucial ecosystem."
"Tsuji, Yamato",Studies on Polyspecific Associations between Primates and Non-Primate Animals: A Review.,Primate Research,24,3,15,,2008,"I reviewed the studies on polyspecific associations between primates and non-primate animals to appreciate the present situation about this topic. I collected 104 case studies from 50 publications. The partner animals included 19 mammal species, 33-34 bird species, 1 reptile species, and 1-2 insect species, respectively. Among them, associations with non-primate mammals (n=43) and birds (n=59) occupied most of the reported cases. Many polyspecific associations between primates and other mammal species were reported from Asia and Africa, while those between primates and bird species were reported from Central and South America. 34 primate species worldwide formed associations with non-primate animals. Polyspecific associations between primates and other animals included 1) that primates (or other animals) provide food resources to their partner animals and 2) that primates (or other animals) provide anti-predator behavior (e.g., sentinel behavior, loud call, and alarm call). The former association increases foraging benefits to the partner animals, and the latter association decreases predation risk of the partner animals. Most studies, however, pointed out that benefit from given associations are commensalisic, (or even parasitism), i. e. biased to non-primate species. Most of these studies are anecdotal, and do not show quantitative data for the frequency of the association or the benefit of partner animals from participating in the associations. Thus, this interesting phenomenon has not been discussed from an ecological perspective. I recommend several approaches for how to overcome these present challenges."

Then we compared strata use of red colobus and Diana monkeys in the presence and absence of mangabeys. Our data indicate that red colobus and Diana monkeys descend to low forest levels and to the forest floor significantly more often when mangabeys are spatially intermingled with them, i.e. in polyspecific associations. The niche extension may Provide some foraging advantage, especially for red colobus. We identified the specific causal agent-relaxed ground predator pressure-of a temporary shift in habitat use. In this instance, the presence of one species (Cercocebus atys) leads to the temporary expansion of a niche normally avoided by others Piliocolobus badius and Cercopithecus diana."

Chlorophyll a, nitrate concentration and water turbidity were extracted from satellite images to record each variation on these parameters caused by the water amount in the lake changes. Each water quality measures have been recorded with its surface area reading to analyses the effects. Water quality parameters were estimated from the Sentinel-2 sensor based on the satellite temporal resolution for the years 2017-2018. Data were pre-processed then processed to estimate the maximum chlorophyll index (MCI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) and normalized difference turbidity index (NDTI). The normalized difference water index (NDWI), was used to calculate and record the changes in the water surface area in Baysh Dam Lake. Results showed different correlation coefficients between the lake surface area and the water quality parameters estimated remote sensing data. The response of the water quality parameters to surface water changes was expressed in four different surface water categories. MCI is more sensitive to surface water changes rather than GNDVI and NDTI. Neural network analysis showed a resemblance between GNDVI and NDTI expressed in sigmoidal function while MCI showed a different behavior expressed in exponential behavior. Therefore, monitoring of the surface water area of the lack is essential in water quality monitoring."

The burrow, typically occupied by shrimps and gobies, is shared with the porcellanid Enosteoides lobatus. In the goby-shrimp association, the fish inhabits the burrow, which is constructed and kept clean by the shrimp, and the fish warns the shrimp of potential dangers approaching their refuge. The porcellanid lives in the burrow and also benefits from living in a habitat where it could not survive without the two sentinel species. Because the limiting resource for the suspension-feeding porcellanid is protected space, this liaison is an adaptation by E. lobatus to a symbiotic life in a habitat that protects it from predation, and is optimal for filter feeding."

Nevertheless, they also brought with them new challenges. The data-hungry training processes of deep learning models demand large, resource expensive, annotated datasets and partly replaced knowledge-driven approaches so that model behaviour and the final prediction process became a black box. The proposed SyntEO approach enables Earth observation researchers to automatically generate large deep learning ready datasets by merging existing and procedural data. SyntEO does this by including expert knowledge in the data generation process in a highly structured manner to control the automatic image and label generation by employing an ontology. In this way, fully controllable experiment environments are set up, which support insights in the model training on the synthetic datasets. Thus, SyntEO makes the learning process approachable, which is an important cornerstone for explainable machine learning. We demonstrate the SyntEO approach by predicting offshore wind farms in Sentinel-1 images on two of the worlds largest offshore wind energy production sites. The largest generated dataset has 90,000 training examples. A basic convolutional neural network for object detection, that is only trained on this synthetic data, confidently detects offshore wind farms by minimising false detections in challenging environments. In addition, four sequential datasets are generated, demonstrating how the SyntEO approach can precisely define the dataset structure and influence the training process. SyntEO is thus a hybrid approach that creates an interface between expert knowledge and data-driven image analysis."

Observed temperature and precipitation data obtained from three high-altitude weather stations are also analyzed to examine the recent climate change in the region. The Khordopin glacier has shown an advancing behavior with an average surge of around 15-18 m/day for April-May 2017; it shows reduced velocity to 10 m/day during May-June 2017 as computed to the monthly Sentinel 2 and Landsat OLI images for the study area. During a field campaign, its velocity was recorded 2 m/day from 2 km above stream level of the glacier flow. However, the glacier shows different surge behaviors at different locations and altitudes. The Khordopin and the associated glacial lake show the best example of a surging glacier and formation of a Glacier dammed lake in the region. On the other hand, Passu Glacier indicates glacier retreating behavior. From the analysis of meteorological data (1995-2010), the maximum and minimum temperatures increase at a rate of 0.07 degrees C/year and 0.08 degrees C/year, respectively, while annual precipitation increases at 0.18 mm/year during the observational period. The MODIS snow data show an increasing trend in maximum snow-covered from 2000 onward, while the decreasing trend in minimum snow-covered from 2000 to 2008."

More than 400 individuals with a heterogeneous GSL distribution have been identified to date. This report aims to qualitatively describe the distribution, dispersal, and relative abundance of blue whales on temporal and spatial scales. Information gathered on humpback whales is also described. Results confirm the general nomadic behaviour of blue whales and suggest that the GSL represents only a portion of the broad summer feeding range. Results also indicate that individual behaviours on site fidelity vary considerably: occasional vs. regular visitors and cosmopolitan vs. exclusive animals. In addition, we were able to distinguish between several areas of significant blue whale sightings based on temporal trends in the site's frequentation. While the lower Estuary seems to be the area where blue whales are most often sighted, the Mingan region has seen its blue whale frequentation decrease to such an extent that observations are now rare. Conversely, an increasing number of humpback whales have been observed in the Mingan region each year. Because many questions on their general ecology remain unanswered, the aim of this study was to increase our knowledge on the habitat use and behaviour of these rorquals. Furthermore, since marine mammals have been proposed as ecosystem sentinels, long-term monitoring can detect spatial or temporal trends that could reflect changing processes in the environment."

Marine birds and sediments which are known as sentinel species and metal reservoir respectively are appropriate indicators of pollutions in marine ecosystems. This survey was conducted in July 2012. Objectives of the study were to examine the concentrations of Vanadium in randomly collected eggs of three breeding tern species and sediments on Shidvar and Bani Farour Islands, in the Persian Gulf; to survey the suitability of terns eggs as a biomonitoring agent. The highest mean of Vanadium level of egg contents and eggshells were found in Bridled Tern from Shidvar Island. The comparison between the same species from these islands indicated that the mean Vanadium level in the White-cheeked Tern and Bridled Tern on Bani Farour Island were more than Shidvar Island while the average was, in contrast, more for the Lesser Crested Tern nesting on Shidvar Island. There was significant difference between concentrations of Vanadium in sediments of these two islands (p<0.01). Although most Vanadium levels in eggs were lower than FSNZ and WHO standards, and the rates in sediments were lower than RSA standard, the relative coordination between concentrations of Vanadium in eggs and sediments in the present study shows that tern eggs represent the pollution status of studying areas as a proper biomonitoring agent."

The relief on this map reflects, for example, places that an animal avoids to minimize risk. Although the LOF concept is a potentially unifying theme in ecology that is often invoked to explain the ecological and conservation significance of fear, little is known about the daily dynamics of an LOF. Despite theory and data to the contrary, investigators often assume, implicitly or explicitly, that an LOF is a static consequence of a predator's mere presence within an ecosystem. We tested the prediction that an LOF in a large-scale, free-living system is a highly dynamic map with peaks and valleys that alternate across the diel (24-h) cycle in response to daily lulls in predator activity. We did so with extensive data from the case study of Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolves (Canis lupus) that was the original basis for the LOF concept. We quantified the elk LOF, defined here as spatial allocation of time away from risky places and times, across nearly 1,000-km(2) of northern Yellowstone National Park and found that it fluctuated with the crepuscular activity pattern of wolves, enabling elk to use risky places during wolf downtimes. This may help explain evidence that wolf predation risk has no effect on elk stress levels, body condition, pregnancy, or herbivory. The ability of free-living animals to adaptively allocate habitat use across periods of high and low predator activity within the diel cycle is an underappreciated aspect of animal behavior that helps explain why strong antipredator responses may trigger weak ecological effects, and why an LOF may have less conceptual and practical importance than direct killing."

Reintroduction efforts at Majete Wildlife Reserve, Malawi, have resulted in rapid population increases, but little is known about how such populations resemble natural populations socially or behaviourally, and what those attributes may reveal about restoration success. Incorporating behavioural knowledge into conservation efforts is an important tool for managing the effects of habitat fragmentation and resource competition. The aim of this study was to quantify the daylight time budget of both family and bachelor bands of reintroduced plains zebra to determine if such behaviours resembled those found in natural populations, and to provide insights into seasonal behavioural patterns that could inform management strategies. We found that feeding occupied the largest percentage (mean = 41.8 % +/- 2.36) of family band daylight time budgets, followed by resting (18.5 % +/- 2.21), locomotion (10.9 % +/- 1.05), vigilance (7.5 % +/- 0.92), maintenance (2.7 % +/- 0.92) and social behaviour (1.4 0 /0 +/- 0.33). Bachelor bands spent the majority of their daylight time being vigilant (27.0 % +/- 2.72), followed by locomotion (21.0 % +/- 2.05), feeding (18.4 % +/- 2.32), resting (15.4 % +/- 2.85), maintenance (6.4 % +/- 1.86) and social behaviour (2.4 % +/- 0.68). The time budgets of zebra in this restored population are generally congruent with those reported in natural populations of plains zebra. Seasonal variation in time spent feeding and resting, locomotion, and change in body condition, however, suggest that dry season resources may negatively impact zebra in the miombo savannah woodlands. These results provide important insights into resource implications for zebra in an ecological system with many large ungulate species that compete for forage, and may assist managers with resource management strategies."

We considered the time intervals before and after the announcement of lockdown, including the same periods for 2019. The results showed that NO2 and PM10 concentrations fell by similar to 30% and 44%, respectively, at urban stations during lockdown compared to 2019. An increase in PM at the industrial station (64% PM2.5 and 8% PM10) could be due to the contribution of industrial sources other than vehicle traffic. Also, we observed a reduction of the tropospheric NO2 column density mean by 54% at urban stations, and AOD values decreased between 38% and 66% during 2020. Concerning the spatial distribution, the tropospheric NO2 column showed a significant reduction of NO2 for the monthly mean in the metropolitan area at lockdown. Similarly, the AOD highest values had a greater extension for 2020 during the pre-lockdown monthly period. After the strict lockdown, concentration values increased steadily, particularly in ground-based measurements. Therefore, we were able to demonstrate the complementarity of ground-based and satellite data measurements of NO2 and aerosol to identify the effects of lockdown measures on the spatial and temporal variability of pollutants."

In this work, we combine the analysis of this exceptional event with some synthetic scenarios, to achieve a deeper understanding of the main processes driving the thermal dynamics of surface water temperature in Lake Superior. The analysis is performed by means of the lumped model air2water, which simulates lake surface temperature as a function of air temperature alone. The model provides information about the seasonal stratification dynamics, suggesting that unusual warming events can result from two factors: anomalously high summer air temperatures, and increased strength of stratification resulting from a warm spring. The relative contribution of the two factors is quantified using the model by means of synthetic scenarios, which provide a simple but effective description of the positive feedback between the thermal behavior and the stratification dynamics of the lake."

Striped skunks, Mephitis mephitis, spray noxious secretions at predators and advertise this danger with deterrent behaviours and black-and-white aposematic coloration. Evidence suggests skunks are effective at deterring terrestrial mammalian predators but are vulnerable to aerial predators; how skunks assess the risk posed by different predator types, however, has not been examined empirically. We recorded the behavioural responses of skunks to audio playbacks of coyotes, Canis latrans, and great horned owls, Bubo virginianus (the primary terrestrial and aerial predators of skunks, respectively), and peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, and white noise as controls. Skunks ran away more often from vocalizations of their main predators, great horned owls and coyotes, than from diurnal falcon vocalizations or white noise recordings. Skunks also tended to run away sooner in response to owl vocalizations than falcon or coyote vocalizations. Finally, subjects tended to engage in vigilance more frequently in response to owl vocalizations than in response to coyote vocalizations, which together with other results suggest that skunks may perceive owls as more threatening relative to coyotes. This study elucidates how a well-defended mammal can determine which perceived threat is the riskiest and alter its behaviour when its main defence strategy may not be successful against all predator types.

Based on this principle of marginal predation, he developed a two-dimensional model involving geometric probability and domains of danger. Consequently, centripetal instincts for survival would have stimulated the development of sociable species. In determining domains of danger for the animal aggregations in this study, two other dimensions are present: one geometric, vertical positioning (height); and one social, altruism. The photography included depicts defensive formations, often stacks or pyramids of weaned laboratory Mongolian gerbils sharing the same tank. Sentinels are also seen operating as altruistic lookouts, seeking the protection of the group last. Results of initially informal as well as experimental observations are presented to begin to define the basic parameters for the behavior.

We propose to join hands together to combat against COVID-19 with some simple tips for our cancer patients to raise their awareness of this public health challenge - combating against COVID-19 with COVID: Continue social distancing; Omit unnecessary face-to-face meting or meal gathering or mass event, make use of cyber meeting, and bring one's own lunch box to work; Visage protection, i.e. universal precaution with surgical masks when going out in a large crowd such as public transport or any close contact in high-risk area; Infection control of the hands with hand hygiene at all times and; Diet, lifestyle, and exercise continue to be balanced and healthy."

However, predator-induced risk effects probably act at different spatial scales, which have often been ignored in trophic cascade studies. We studied how a fine-scale risk factor (distance from tree logs) affects ungulate browsing intensity and how this is modified over a landscape-scale risk gradient (distance from human settlements to wolf core) in the Biaowiea forest, Poland. We found that landscape-and fine-scale risk factors strongly interacted in determining the strength and magnitude of carnivore-induced risk effects on lower trophic levels. In low-risk areas, tree logs reduced browsing intensity in small patches (approx. 4-6m from logs), whereas in high-risk areas browsing intensity was reduced up to at least 16m from tree logs. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects changed, with the strongest reduction in browsing intensity around tree logs in high-risk areas (up to 37%) and the smallest in low-risk areas (<20%). Overall, the results of this study indicate that perceived risk factors act at different spatial scales, where impediments (objects blocking view and escape routes) act as a risk factor at a fine scale and carnivore distribution shapes perceived risk at the landscape scale. Moreover, these risk factors strongly interact, thereby determining the functional role of large carnivores in affecting ecosystem processes. These interactive effects should be incorporated in predator-induced trophic cascade studies to understand patterns of tree regeneration in ecosystems where large carnivores and herbivores live together."

Lives of pedestrians and passengers are put to risk as drivers tend to fall asleep at the steering wheel. In the recent past, many researchers have paid attention to the problem of drowsiness detection since safe roads and safe driving are of paramount concern to all societies. This paper has led to the development of several novel and effective methods in detecting drivers' drowsiness. These include: 1) Vehicle based methods; 2) Behavioral methods; and 3) Physiological methods. Since wake-sleep is an intermediate state between two physiologically dissimilar states, physiological signals can define this transition more accurately when compared with approaches that fall in other categories. This paper focuses on the role of physiological signals in detecting driver's drowsiness level. The proposed methods measure the physiological signals by means of various sensors, which monitor the driver's physiological parameters on a continual basis. Multiple sensors can be embedded on the driver or in the vicinity of the driver to capture vital signs indicating the onset of drowsiness. The aim here is to provide an insightful review of all such key approaches that fall in this category. This paper conducts a detailed study in which key physiological parameters that relate to drowsiness are identified, described, and analyzed. Furthermore, the overall advantages and limitations of these physiological based schemes are also highlighted."

However, studies of animal personality suggest that behaviour can be 'constrained' to certain behavioural types, leading to consistent differences between individuals. Few studies have investigated the interaction between personality traits and the need for flexibility in individuals over different, naturally occurring situations in the wild. We investigated whether free-living Namibian rock agamas, Agama planiceps, were constrained by personality types or showed behavioural plasticity when their environmental conditions changed dramatically between the dry and rainy seasons. We examined three key behaviours: risk taking as measured by flight initiation distance, time budgets focusing on time spent conspicuous and rates of signalling directed at conspecifics. Risk-taking behaviour of males showed stable between-individual differences, but no between-individual differences in plasticity, supporting previous evidence that antipredator behaviour is determined by personality in this species. Time spent conspicuous showed a response to season, and an interaction between the individual and season, suggesting that behavioural plasticity itself may be a personality trait. In contrast, signalling behaviour changed in response to season but did not vary consistently between individuals. We suggest that where there are reliable environmental cues, individual plasticity will be favoured over consistency in the relevant behaviours.

At present, however, it is still unclear whether interference competition is of importance for foraging waders. To support this idea experimental evidence and knowledge of the mechanisms underlying interference effects are required. We experimentally determined the relationship between forager density and foraging success in two wader species: the red knot (Calidris canutus) and the ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres). With each of the two species, we conducted an experiment consisting of 300 one-min trials. In these trials we scored the behavior and the foraging success of focal individuals at specific combinations of bird and prey density. Irrespective of prey density, individuals of both species discovered fewer prey items at higher bird densities. Despite this, only in turnstones did intake rates decline with increasing bird density. Knots compensated for a lower prey-discovery rate by rejecting fewer prey items at higher bird densities. In knots, bird density had a complex, nonmonotonic effect on the time spent vigilant and searching. In turnstones the main effect of increased bird density was a reduction in the prey-encounter rate, that is, the reward per unit search time. Effects on the time spent vigilant and the time spent searching were less pronounced than in knots. Thus, the mechanistic basis of the effects of bird density was complex for each of the two species and differed between them."

In 1992, we carried out a reintroduction in spring, using 38 radiotagged yearlings (23 males and 15 females), and a second one in autumn, using 124 juveniles (32 radiotagged). In spring before release, a control group (n=10) was fed a standard diet with 6% fibre and an experimental group (n=5) a diet with 17% fibre, while all birds released in autumn were fed a high-fibre diet. After release, the birds of the experimental group had a smaller home range and a higher mean time period of survival than those of the control group (0.04+-0.01 (SE) ha vs 0.07+-0.02(SE) ha, 20.4 days vs 9.5 days, P<0.05). Predation was the most frequent cause of mortality (79%, n=38) and the red fox, Vulpes vulpes, was the most important predator (90%, n=30 predation cases). In autumn, juveniles had larger home ranges (1.23+-0.1(SE) ha, P<0.01), a longer maximum time period of survival (>74 days vs 37 days), were less predated by foxes (56%, n=25 vs 79%) and more by raptors (28% vs 7%) than yearlings released in spring (P<0.05). In an experiment carried out in captivity, 94.5% of 73 rock partridge yearlings, belonging to the same released stock, showed an anti-predator (mainly vigilance) behavioural response to a silhouette of a raptor and a stuffed fox. This indicates that there was no deficit in such a behaviour in the released birds. We recommend to fed partridges a high-fibre diet before release."

In this study, we assessed whether zebrafish modified their spacing and interaction time in an additive or multiplicative way relative to multiple sources of social information using computer animations. We simultaneously manipulated: (a) the size of the virtual conspecific (as a proxy of social cue magnitude), (b) the position of the virtual conspecific in the water column (as a proxy of the level of perceived risk), and (c) the absence/presence of the visual horizon (as a proxy of depth perception). We found that the size of the virtual conspecific independently affected spacing behavior (zebrafish increased their separation distance as conspecific size increased). However, some of these factors interacted significantly, such that their effects on social behavior depended on each other. For instance, zebrafish increased their separation distance under high risk conditions when the virtual conspecific was larger, but this risk effect disappeared when the conspecific was the same size or smaller, likely to avoid aggression. Also, zebrafish increased their separation distance when depth perception was enhanced under low risk conditions, but the effect of depth perception disappeared under high risk conditions. Overall, we found that certain dimensions of the visual social environment affected zebrafish spacing behavior in different ways, but they did not affect social interaction time. We discuss the implications of these findings for the spatial organization of fish schools."

We measured the effects of supplemental food on activity and browsing patterns during seasons of scarce natural food resources in 2008 and 2009 for a herd of six animals in the Fathala Reserve (Senegal). In response to the provision of high-quality pods of Acacia albida, animals reduced foraging time in 2008 and allocated it to resting. This pattern corresponds to the animals' behaviour in captivity without foraging versus vigilance trade-offs and with predictable (in time and space) access to food. In 2009, supplemental feeding had no effect on behaviour and was associated with increased foraging and ruminating times than in 2008, suggesting more limited natural food resources in 2009. We recorded high species diversity in the animals' natural diet. Supplemental food did not induce changes in browsing pattern at the plant species level, probably due to small individual effect on total nutrient and energy intake. Food supplementation, however, facilitates the animals overcoming unfavourable conditions or alleviates stress with additional rest, and could therefore assist as a conservation intervention to enhance fitness."

This situation is called the Dear Enemy effect. One explanation of the Dear Enemy effect is that it is due to a conditional strategy like Tit for Tat where territory holders cooperate by reducing aggression towards neighbours that also show reduced aggression, but retaliate against aggressive neighbours. Previous research found evidence for such a conditional strategy in migratory species but not in species with long-term association between neighbours, suggesting that long-term neighbours might be engaged in more 'forgiving' strategies. We tested this hypothesis in male song sparrows, Melodia melospiza, which are resident year-round in our population (leading to long-term associations between neighbouring birds) and display the Dear Enemy effect. We found that following a simulated intrusion by a neighbour, song sparrow males responded more strongly to playback of this neighbour than to playback of a neutral neighbour from their respective boundaries, consistent with a conditional retaliation strategy. We suggest that the primary effect of an intrusion by a neighbour might be to increase the perceived risk of cuckoldry by the intruding male, and increased aggression and vigilance towards this neighbour might be a strategy to prevent cuckoldry.

However, in birds, higher predation on females is sometimes observed. Parental investment may be high in females (egg-laying, incubation and feeding of offspring), which might lead to a high risk of predation. We studied predation by sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus in relation to behaviour in pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca where breeding males are more conspicuous than females in plumage and behaviour. Male pied flycatchers generally occupied more exposed perches than females. Females were more mobile and foraged more than males, especially prior to and during incubation. During the incubation and nestling stages, when predation on the sexes could be directly compared, sparrowhawks took about the same number of male and female pied flycatchers. During incubation, however, females spent about 77% of the day in the nest and were 4.7 times more vulnerable than males per unit of time available (i.e. outside the nest). A comparison with the chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, where hawks took more females than males, indicates that timing of breeding, foraging behaviour and parental roles of males and females affect predation risk."

The increased human presence has modified fishes' antipredator behavioural responses, and consequently flight decisions, as a function of their changed perceptions of risk. Understanding how fish react to human presence can help identify the most vulnerable functional groups/species and estimate impacts caused by human disturbance. Shoal and body size are known to influence fish flight initiation distance (FID; the distance between the predator and prey when the prey begins to escape); however, few studies attempt to test the moderators of these relationships. Here, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating FID of fish in response to human presence. Specifically, we investigated six candidate moderators that could influence the relationship between FID with shoal and body size. Our results showed that individual fish size was strongly and positively correlated with FID and the most important moderator that explained the variance in individual body size-FID relationship was shoaling behaviour. However, and somehow surprisingly, we detected no significant relationship between shoal size and FID. We discuss how these results can inform the development of fish conservation strategies and ultimately assist in the management of marine protected areas."

We predicted that the (1) nocturnal rodent will feed mainly at night and the diurnal rodent mainly during the day; and (2) the herbivore consuming a relatively low energy diet will spend more time feeding than the granivore Consuming a relatively high energy diet. The latter prediction was confirmed in that P. obesus spent more time feeding than M. crassus. Number of feeding sessions in M. crassus was the same as in P. obesus but each feeding session was shorter. However, the former prediction was only partially confirmed. Feeding during the dark phase was significantly longer than the light phase in the nocturnal M. crassus, as predicted; but feeding did not differ between diel phases in the diurnal P. obesus. The large amount of forage required by P. obesus necessitated consumption throughout the light and dark phases at the same rates of intake."

The chipmunks did not significantly increase the mean percentage of time they spent pausing or vocalizing after any of the raptor's calls. However, immediately following each of the four raptor's calls, the chipmunks did briefly pause and scan significantly more than in the control trials. These results suggest that the chipmunks briefly assess the risk of predation immediately after a raptor call. If no additional indication of predation is evident, they make no adjustments to their time allocation. We suggest that chipmunks may interpret the calls as only an indicator of the proximity of a raptor rather than an immediate threat of attack."

An increase in time spent foraging by goslings during our study was weakly correlated with an increase in the size of the local breeding population. Amount of time spent feeding by adults and goslings increased throughout the brood rearing period. Overall, goslings spent more time feeding than either adult females or males, and adult males spent the most time alert. Time alert varied among brood rearing areas and increased with brood size, but there was no variation in time spent alert among years. Increases in feeding or alert behaviors were at a cost to time spent in all other behaviors. We suggest that there is not a simple trade-off between feeding and alert behavior in cacklers, but instead that time spent feeding and alert are optimized against all other behaviors. We suggest that forage quality and availability determines the amount of time spent feeding, whereas the threat of predation or disturbance determines the amount of time spent alert."

Antipredator behaviors should be attenuated or lost in such a context of relaxed predation pressure. To test this prediction, we analyzed daily and seasonal habitat selection and activity rhythm (both commonly linked to predation risk) of GPS-collared Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis Merriam, 1898) on predator-free islands (British Columbia, Canada). In marked contrast to the behavioral patterns commonly observed in populations subject to predation risk, we documented a very low day-night contrast in habitat selection. Moreover, we observed higher activity during daytime than nighttime, as expected for nonhunted populations. We also showed that resource selection was primarily driven by seasonal variations in resource availability. These results are consistent with the expected attenuation of antipredator behaviors in predation-free environments. However, we also observed marked crepuscular activity peaks, which are commonly interpreted as an antipredator response in ungulates. Our study indicates that large herbivores are able to adjust certain antipredator behaviors under relaxed selection, notably habitat selection and activity rhythm, while others persist despite the long-term absence of predators."

We investigated the relationship between sociability and boldness, another fundamental personality axis, using a wild population of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) tested in their natural environment. We studied 2 dimensions of sociability (grouping behavior and association patterns). Over 2 years we found significant within-individual consistency and interindividual variation in the foraging group sizes of 171 females. Network analysis comparisons of 103 females between the years, using HWIG (an association index that controls for gregariousness), showed that individuals were also highly consistent in their social network measures. We tested the boldness of 51 of these females 6-21 times each over 18 months, using flight initiation distance tests; individuals were also highly consistent in this measure of personality. Shy females had significantly larger mean foraging group sizes. After controlling for gregariousness and space use, shy females had fewer preferred associates than bolder females. Therefore, boldness can have an important influence on the size and composition of foraging groups and thus social networks, in wild mammals."

Our objective was to quantify intrasexual habitat use of female Stone's sheep relative to maternal status using measures of behaviour and habitat use. We reviewed three hypotheses of intersexual segregation (predation-risk, forage-selection, and activity-budget hypotheses) to determine if they also explained intrasexual segregation of female Stone's sheep. Female Stone's sheep spent the majority of their active time foraging. Nursery groups spent shorter durations of time active, more time active in solid rock escape features, and less time active in shrub habitat than nonmaternal groups. The best predictive model describing intrasexual differences incorporated distance to nearest escape feature and size of nearest escape feature. Regardless of maternal status, female Stone's sheep used low-elevation plant communities early in the growing season that were characterized by more shrub species and increased cover. As the growing season progressed, they tracked a phenological stage, moving up in elevation and associating with communities that contained increasing amounts of moss and lichen cover. The patterns in behaviour, habitat use, and vegetation associations between intrasexual groups of Stone's sheep were best characterized by the predation-risk hypothesis."

A complete understanding of the functional significance of both predator attack behaviours and prey escape behaviours can only come from examining the interaction between both parties. For example, although the predatory strike of venomous snakes has been studied extensively in the laboratory, we have little understanding of the proximate factors influencing snake strike behaviour under natural conditions. Here, we report details of the analysis of predatory strikes of free-ranging rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) towards their natural prey. We found that over half of strike attempts were unsuccessful, and the most significant factor influencing strike success was the ability of prey animals to initiate a rapid evasive dodge manoeuvre in the fraction of a second after snakes initiated strikes, but before snake strikes contacted them. Snakes, in turn, initiated strikes most frequently towards the flank of laterally moving prey, which is probably an attempt to counter the ability of prey to dodge strikes.

We hypothesized that group size (i) would be larger in open than in closed habitats, since it is an antipredator response, and (ii) would vary more with habitat type in the species that had higher wolf predation rates. In the study area, wolves were the only predator of wild ungulates, with roe deer being the main target prey. We performed monthly transects along paths to observe the group size of red and roe deer. In roe deer, the mean group size was significantly higher in open than in closed habitats, serving as an antipredator response. However, in red deer, habitat type did not affect group size. The results indicate that under predation risk by wolves the habitat type influences the grouping behavior of roe deer but not red deer. Furthermore, compared with forests, heaths offer less protection from predators and species in this habitat would benefit from larger group sizes."

We, thus, present a first empirical investigation of the indirect, informational consequences of perceived predation risk. Specifically, we focus on the ability to track the quality of seed patches in sandy habitats. There are two potential effects here; since instantaneous intake rate (or some proxy) is the key parameter of interest to an optimal forager, apprehension can interfere with the estimation of: (1) the number of food items captured, and/or (2) the time taken to capture them (the ability to locate food items). Only (2) will have a consistent effect on patch quality, and we test the hypothesis that increased predation risk reduces gerbil search efficiency. We therefore quantified gerbil search paths in patches of uniform seed distribution that differed in their associated risks of predation by manipulating the presence of barn owls, Tyto alba, and light in an aviary. Gerbil search was more random under risky conditions. We discuss the implications of this result for information processing and patch use under predation risk, and the foraging games between gerbils and owls in the Negev Desert."

Bird bills have been the subject of classic evolutionary studies that demonstrate how morphological adaptations are driven by foraging ecology. As significant areas of heat loss, bills are also under selection with respect to thermoregulation, yet the ecological consequences of this function have been largely ignored until recently. 2. Given the role of bills in thermoregulation is important, we predict that birds should behave to minimise heat loss through their bills at lower ambient temperatures by attempting to insulate their bill in their plumage. 3. Our second prediction is that this thermoregulatory behaviour should be utilised more by species with relatively larger bills, because they will be more prone to heat loss. 4. We demonstrate both these predictions to be correct using field observations and a comparative analysis of nine shorebird species. First, the placement of the bill within the back plumage while roosting (back rest' behaviour), which insulates the bill, becomes more frequent at cooler temperatures. Second, species with large bills relative to their body size do indeed use back rest behaviour more frequently across a range of temperatures. 5. Our findings show that behavioural thermoregulation can be mediated by bill size, and that bill morphology is not only relevant to foraging ecology but also influences behavioural adaptations to climate."

Although asymmetries in information about risk exist among members of real groups, we know little about how such uneven information might affect individual or group antipredator decisions. Hence, we studied the use and transfer of information about the risk of predation in small flocks of wintering birds. House finches (Carpodacus mexicanus; 28 groups of three) were held in large enclosures divided into safe and risky patches. We controlled the information about risk available to each individual by conducting attacks with a model hawk that was visible to only a single (informed) bird. Repeated attacks on a single individual did not reduce the amount of feeding by other birds in that patch, although the time to resume feeding after observing a response to an attack event was somewhat longer than after a no attack event. These results suggest that informed individuals impart some information to naive (uninformed) birds, but this effect was not strong. In fact, the frequent return of informed individuals to feeders after observing uninformed individuals feed suggests that finches relied more on public information regarding safety than their own personal information in deciding when to feed. Group patch choice appeared to be based on a majority-rules decision, although an effect of dominance status was apparent. Our results suggest that subordinate flock members may exert a large influence over group decision-making by acting as spatial 'anchors'."

Maritime traffic in Arctic waters is prone to encounter dangerous ice conditions, and it is essential to study the mechanism of ice collision risk formation in relation to ice conditions. Taking the ship-ice collision risk in Arctic waters as the research object, we propose a dynamic assessment model of ship-ice collision risk under sea ice status dynamic association (SDA) effect. By constructing the standard paradigm of risk factor dynamic association (DA) effect, taking SDA as the key association factor. Combing with other risk factors that affect ship-ice collision accidents, the coupling relationship between risk factors were analyzed. Then, using the Bayesian network method to build a ship-ice collision accident dynamic risk assessment model and combing with the ice monitoring data in summer Arctic waters, we screen five ships' position information on the trans-Arctic route in August. The risk behavior of ship-ice collision accidents on the selected route under SDA is analyzed by model simulation. The research reveal that the degree of SDA is a key related factor for the serious ice condition and the possibility of human error during ship's navigation, which significantly affects the ship-ice collision risk. The traffic in Arctic waters requires extra vigilance of the SDA effect from no ice threat to ice threat, and continuous ice threat. According to the ship-ice collision risk analysis under the SDA effect and without SDA effect, the difference in risk reasoning results on the five stations of the selected route are 32.69%, -32.33%, -27.64%, -10.26%, and -30.13% respectively. The DA effect can optimize ship-ice collision risk inference problem in Arctic waters."
"Favati, Anna; Lovlie, Hanne; Leimar, Olof","Individual aggression, but not winner-loser effects, predicts social rank in male domestic fowl",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,28,874,882,10.1093/beheco/arx053,2017,"Many factors can affect the probability for an individual to obtain a high social rank, including size, weaponry, and behavioral attributes such as aggression. Recent experiences of winning or losing can also affect the chances of winning future contests, commonly referred to as winner-loser effects. Individuals often differ in behavior in a consistent way, including in aggression, thereby showing differences in personality. However, the relative importance of recent experience and aspects of personality in determining rank, as well as the extent to which winning or losing affects aggression, has rarely been studied. Here, we investigate these questions using male domestic fowl. We matched males for body size, comb size, and aggression in pair-wise duels to: 1) study the effect of contest outcome on aggression and 2) compare the effect of individual aggression and contest experience on future social status in small groups. We found that aggression was a highly repeatable personality trait and that aggression increased after winning and decreased after losing. Nevertheless, such winner-loser effects were not enough to increase the odds of becoming dominant in a small group. Instead, aggressiveness measured prior to a contest experience best predicted future rank. Boldness and exploration did not predict rank and of the 2, only boldness was positively correlated with aggressiveness. We conclude that for male domestic fowl in contests among phenotypically matched contestants, aggressiveness is more important for obtaining high rank than winner-loser effects, or other aspects of personality."

However, the ability to copy a demonstrated action might depend not only on the imitative ability of the observer but also on its attention, a factor widely neglected in discussions and experiments. Since attention differs between species as well as between individuals, it is likely to influence the amount and type of information different species and/or observers may extract from a given demonstration. We studied attention in common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus. In a series of experimental sessions, individual marmosets watched different conspecific models that were searching, manipulating an object and feeding. The observers could see the demonstration through two observation holes, which allowed us to measure exactly how often and for how long they watched the model. Marmosets were more attentive towards conspecifics engaged in a problem-solving task than an exploring model. Individual variation in attention was large, ranging from less than 10% to over 49%. Attention also depended on the identity of the model with an increase in attention if it was of the opposite sex. Overall, attention of marmosets was short with a median duration of 6 s while the model manipulated an object. This study measured the real interest of the observer towards a model, which could be an important variable in social-learning experiments. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

This species, therefore, is a model organism for experimental studies of social behavior without the confounding influence of aggression. We used video surveillance cameras to assess the importance of self-grooming and allogrooming in the social life of this species. Detailed analysis of individual behavioral sequences using Markov chain methods revealed that self-grooming is a relatively stereotypic, sex-independent activity usually lasting about 8 s. Allogrooming is conditional in the herb-field mouse, because it takes the form of a reciprocal strategy, with the differences between nonmatching bouts varying according to whether the initiator of allogrooming is male or female and whether both interactants are of the same or opposite sex. Our analysis revealed that the exchange of allogrooming bouts between individuals of the same sex is reciprocal, but that males allow females to defect more often than vice versa, and males groomed females for longer than predicted by the distribution of individual self-grooming bouts. In those species where the demand for mating by males is far greater than that offered by females, in other words where females may select mates, asymmetry of allogrooming may provide a mechanism for females to test the suitability of males for mating. It may also provide the means for males to stimulate females before mating. Furthermore, allogrooming was the only sex-dependent behavior of the several tested in our experiment. As such, we suggest that allogrooming is the predominant premating mechanism in this species."

The purpose of the releases were to increase population size and the potential number of breeding individuals of the sole extant wild population, and to refine release protocols for eventual reintroduction of a second wild population elsewhere on the island. After extensive prerelease training, we released 10 parrots in 2000, 16 parrots in 2001, and eight parrots in 2002 ranging in age from 1-4 years old. All birds were equipped with radio-transmitters to monitor survival. The overall first-year survival estimate for the 34 parrots was 41 % (Cl 22%-61%). Only one parrot died within the first week postrelease, with most (94%) surviving for at least eight weeks after release. Most (54%) documented mortalities were due to raptor predation, which claimed 21 % of all released parrots. A captive-reared bird (male, age one), released in 2001, paired with a wild female and fledged two young in 2004. We also calculated survival based on 0% and 50% of observed predation losses and found hypothetical survival rates of 72% and 54%, respectively. Rigorous prerelease training and acclimation was believed to have improved initial postrelease parrot survival, and releasing mixed age-class groups suggests the potential for shortening the time to recruitment."

In this study, we report information about the phenology and activity patterns of this raptor at the Pampas of Argentina. We found that White-tailed Kites have a prolonged breeding season, from October to May. Time-activity budgets of mating pairs indicated a pronounced division of roles in parental care between sexes. Females devoted most of their time to nest construction, incubation and chick care (80% of total time) and males to food provisioning and vigilance (70% of total time). We registered 11 cases of prey transfer from the male to the female. In four cases the transfer occurred in flight and in the remaining seven cases while individuals were perched. Our results agree with general patterns on breeding behavior of White-tailed Kites from North America, suggesting a consistent behavioral pattern throughout the species' distribution."

I investigate a potential case between a predator, the peregrine falcon, and a prey species, the semipalmated sandpiper, during fall staging by sandpipers. For the falcons, attacking vulnerable sandpipers roosting on the shore too early would discourage roosting, but waiting too long might be problematic as well since the roost could disband. Sandpipers are expected to be responsive against potential attacks, but being responsive too long comes at the cost of curtailing rest. The evolutionary stable solution in this game suggests that falcons should attack at all possible times, but concentrate their attacks in the early phases of roosting. Responsiveness by sandpipers, which I measured using the rate of false alarms during roosting, should decrease with time spent roosting. I provide evidence in support of these two predictions, suggesting that falcons and sandpipers are engaged in a war of attrition."

A captive population of seven females and three males was established under a recovery plan for this species to provide progeny for release into the wild. This study aimed to investigate the behaviour of mixed-sex and all-female pairs in this population and determine whether behaviour useful for survival in the wild could be stimulated by environmental-enrichment programs. Gliders spent 56% of their time in their nest box and were essentially nocturnal, except for emerging at 1300 hours when food was offered. They were unresponsive to enrichment programs designed to encourage climbing and play, but increased foraging in response to enrichments designed to stimulate feeding behaviour and increase safety from predators. Females kept in same-sex pairs spent more time climbing than those in mixed-sex pairs. In the latter, males spent more time than females stationary and staring, suggesting vigilance, with less active time outside the nest box. Paternal nurturing behaviour was observed for the first time in this species, and this suggests a dominant caring role for males in this species. Copulation was also observed for the first time, but there was no evidence of courtship. It is concluded that the enrichments designed to stimulate foraging activity were successful, and that males played a major role in the rearing of young in this species, which needs to be recognised in managing captive populations."

We collected scent-marking data on adult male Lemur catta at Beza-Mahafaly Reserve (dry forest), and on Eulemur fulvus rufus at Ranomafana National Park (rain forest), Madagascar: In Lemur, rates of overall scent-marking differed significantly by reproductive season, with higher rates occurring in mating and lactation/migration periods, whereas in Eulemur, reproductive season did not appear to affect scent-marking rates. Dominance rank of male Lemur catta did not affect rates of scent-marking. Among male Eulemur fulvus, dominance relations were not apparent; however, 2 of the 5 focal males scent-marked somewhat more frequently during the mating season and also experienced greater mating success In Lemur catta, higher rates of scent-marking in the mating season may relate to indirect reproductive competition during a period of high aggression, while such mating competition was not as marked in Eulemur fulvus. Furthermore, higher rates of marking in resident male Lemur catta during male migration may correlate with vigilance toward immigrating males Greater overall scent-marking rates in ring-tailed lemurs may relate to extensive intergroup home range overlap and no area of exclusive use, whereas the red-fronted lemur groups tended to forage in areas of their home range where little-to-no intergroup overlap occurred."

Competition for resources and predation pressure are 2 primary, factors that influence sociality and group size in a variety of species. In this correlative study, I investigated how resource competition and predation influenced group size and female reproduction in the common warthog, Phacochoerus africanus. The distribution of group sizes indicated that group size depended on the age and sex of the participants. Yearlings formed larger groups than adults, whereas adult males and adult females formed similar sized groups, although males were more likely, to be solitary. The demand for preferred habitat, clan density, predation pressure, and the time of year explained significant variation in the size of adult, female groups but not in the size of adult male or yearling groups. Clan areas with more warthogs per area of preferred habitat were associated with smaller adult female groups, whereas higher densities of warthogs were associated with larger group sizes. Increasing indication of predator presence in a clan area had little influence on grouping behavior in general but resulted in larger female group sizes late in the dry season and with increased sightings of females with juveniles. The relationship between group size and predation pressure may be a consequence of group stability and higher mortality, in larger groups."

Adults with juveniles spend more than twice as much time being vigilant and aggressive than do those without offspring. The loss of a partner, however, does not result in the remaining parent increasing parental care but does result in increased 'self-care' by the juveniles. Neither parents nor single-parent juveniles appear to pay an energetic cost relative to non-parental adults and two-parent juveniles, respectively. Differences in the feeding distribution of parents and non-parents and equivalent or better physical condition suggests that families are able to maintain access to a superior food supply over the winter. Passive 'assistance' by juveniles may assist in maintaining this position in favoured areas, and this is achieved with little overt aggression. The present study thus provides no data that show a net cost to parents by remaining with their juveniles over the winter period. Thus, mutual assistance might be a better explanation of the prolonged association rather than a period of parental investment with an overall cost."

Raptor attacks Inter in the season resulted in Fewer birds being isolated from the Rock; isolated birds were invariably chased by the predator, Anti-predator flocking reactions also changed with time, complex flashing, rippling and columnar nights were more common later in the season. It appears that individuals (probably juveniles) gathered at common feeding grounds for some time gain the experience necessary to perform complex group anti-predator behaviors proficiently."

Some species respond differentially to graded risk by attending to relevant predator cues, such as head orientation and gaze direction. One benefit of graded-risk sensitivity is fewer missed foraging opportunities. It is not known how the makeup of risk response behaviors in mixed-species flocks may relate to the relative nuclearity of each species in the flock. In the current study, predator models were presented to two nuclear and two satellite species of passerines that frequently occur in natural mixed flocks. Predator models either faced toward or away from a nearby stocked feeder to simulate high and low risk of predation, and calling and seed-taking rates of the present flock were recorded. The nuclear species, great tits (Parus major) and crested tits (Lophophanes cristatus), took more seeds when the predator faced away from the feeder than toward it. The satellite species, Eurasian nuthatches (Sitta europaea) and willow tits (Poecile montanus), did not show an effect of predator orientation. No species showed consistent differences in calling behavior relative to predator orientation, although insufficient calling data for great tits prevented analysis for this species. The results of this study suggest that one aspect of nuclearity in mixed-species flocks is a tendency for graded-risk sensitivity, or alternatively, that satellite species are more sensitive to mere predator presence rather than to predator orientation cues."

The data collected over the last 30 years show stability of the Ariege population: little variation has been observed in brood size, occupation rate of the sites or reproductive success. Only the increasing number of known nesting sites is significant, due to better knowledge of the territory by observers over time. In 2017, the breeding population was estimated to be 24 pairs. Urban monitoring proved the presence of individuals in passage, wintering or resident in Toulouse. Since 2002, downtown Toulouse has been visited by several individuals of both sexes and interactions between males and females have been observed since 2005. Despite the multiplicity of possible eyries or nesting sites in Toulouse, and the massive presence of Peregrine Falcons and dedicated bird watchers, no case of breeding has been reported. In addition to monitoring, measures to protect and support the presence of the species have been put in place. In the Pyrenees, in the light of the growth of human activities near nesting sites, some sites are now subject to official protective measures, coupled with constant vigilance and awareness. In Toulouse, to encourage the breeding of the individuals present two nesting boxes were installed in 2016, on two buildings frequented by a female and a male. In 2017, a first attempt to reproduce in one of these installations confirmed the value of such developments in urban areas."

We studied effects of several risk factors on escape responses by the Balearic lizard (Podarcis lilfordi, Lacertidae) on escape responses. Escape was elicited by an approaching experimenter who recorded flight initiation distance (predator-prey distance when escape begins) and distance fled. When an experimenter approached from above (upslope), flight initiation distance and distance fled were longer than when the experimenter approached from below. This novel effect suggests that lizards exposed to aerial predation might have been naturally selected to respond rapidly to predators approaching from above or that effects of path inclination of escape ability may differ between predators and prey in a manner requiring a larger margin of safety during approaches from above than below. Although sex differences in aspects of escape occur in some lizards, including lacertids, no sex difference was observed in P. lilfordi. Because vigilance and some other aspects of antipredatory behavior exhibit cortical lateralization, we tested effects of approach from the left and right sides of lizards. As predicted by optimal escape theory, side of approach did not affect flight initiation distance. Because many lizards have color vision and respond to pigmentation of conspecifics in social settings, researchers have often worn only drably colored clothing when simulating predators. This precaution may be unnecessary because flight initiation distance did not differ among investigator shirt colors (red, orange, olive)."

Although some studies have investigated the factors which affect visual food detection, very little is known about what influences olfactory food detection abilities in wild animals. The food discovery behavior of ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua) was studied using experimental fruit plots. Coatis primarily used olfaction to detect these new food sources, and visual food discovery appeared plausible in only five of 148 trials. Coatis detected the fruit from longer distances when traveling compared with when foraging for invertebrates in the leaf litter. Travel speed had a negative effect on discovery distance. Coatis traveling slowly detected the fruit plots from further away, which demonstrated a tradeoff between speed and food detection. If this tradeoff is biologically important, slower groups should have visited more fruit trees per day, so data taken during full-day coati group follows were analyzed to determine whether this pattern occurred. Slower moving groups visited more fruit trees than faster groups once confounding factors such as daily travel distance, group identity, group spread, and year were controlled for. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that coatis exhibit a speed-accuracy tradeoff for olfactory food detection. This tradeoff appears to be an important factor influencing the movement ecology of animal groups."

This behavior is thought to enable subordinate animals to avoid conflict. We sought to clarify whether visual attention behavior functions in this manner in a small captive group of brown capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella. We tested the hypothesis that social monitoring is related to dominance status. Dominance status was determined based on the directionality of aggressive behavior, and visual attention was quantified by using focal animal sampling. Subordinate animals directed significantly more visual attention toward others than dominant animals. Subordinate animals also looked more frequently at the animals that attacked them and others the most. The results indicate that social monitoring behavior in this captive group was driven by conflict-avoidance."

This may be either to ignore, flee, hide or alarm call. While many species are able to derive detailed information from the chemical cues associated with predator scent, for some the decision to respond is often made without being able to identify the actual location and intentions of the predator. Depending on the sociality and ecology of the species, it may pay to flee or to engage in predator inspection where knowledge is impure. We tested for this in two sympatric marsupial macropodids, the parma wallaby ( Macropus parma) and the red-necked pademelon (Thylogale thetis), as little is known of how these species detect and respond to olfactory cues of predation risk. We observed that, when presented with a synthetic predator scent mimicking dog urine, the social forager, T. thetis, tended to spend more time close to the predator odour, while the solitary forager, M. parma, exhibited an aversive response. The results suggest that social and ecological constraints on the sensory modalities used in predator detection may influence how macropodids respond to olfactory predator cues."
"Reinner, Jody R.; Mangel, Marc; Derocher, Andrew E.; Lewis, Mark A.",Modeling optimal responses and fitness consequences in a changing Arctic.,Global Change Biology,25,3450,3461,,2019,"Animals must balance a series of costs and benefits while trying to maximize their fitness. For example, an individual may need to choose how much energy to allocate to reproduction versus growth, or how much time to spend on vigilance versus foraging. Their decisions depend on complex interactions between environmental conditions, behavioral plasticity, reproductive biology, and energetic demands. As animals respond to novel environmental conditions caused by climate change, the optimal decisions may shift. Stochastic dynamic programming provides a flexible modeling framework with which to explore these trade-offs, but this method has not yet been used to study possible changes in optimal trade-offs caused by climate change. We created a stochastic dynamic programming model capturing trade-off decisions required by an individual adult female polar bear (Ursus maritimus) as well as the fitness consequences of her decisions. We predicted optimal foraging decisions throughout her lifetime as well as the energetic thresholds below which it is optimal for her to abandon a reproductive attempt. To explore the effects of climate change, we shortened the spring feeding period by up to 3 weeks, which led to predictions of riskier foraging behavior and higher reproductive thresholds. The resulting changes in fitness may be interpreted as a best-case scenario, where bears adapt instantaneously and optimally to new environmental conditions. If the spring feeding period was reduced by 1 week, her expected fitness declined by 15%, and if reduced by 3 weeks, expected fitness declined by 68%. This demonstrates an effective way to explore a species' optimal response to a changing landscape of costs and benefits and highlights the fact that small annual effects can result in large cumulative changes in expected lifetime fitness."

Thus, we studied rodent anti-predator behavior in a new tropical system: the rodent Thrichomys fosteri in the Pantanal wetlands. We tested two hypotheses: (1) patch use decreases with distance to caraguata (Bromelia balansae) bushes, as it would be expected if they were shelters; (2) canopy cover increases patch use, as it is also a form of cover. To test those hypotheses, we set eight 6x4 grids of patches composed of 200mL of sand and 20.5g of peanuts. We measured giving-up densities, the leftover food in patch, which is inversely proportional to time in habitat. We found support for hypothesis 1, but also evidence in contradiction of hypothesis 2. We suggest that open areas may be dangerous to the predators of T. fosteri, making these habitats safer than the forests for this rodent. We conclude that this tropical species adheres to global patterns, but only at microhabitat level."

We measured foraging efficiency (percentage of active time spent foraging) for Alaskan moose (Alces alces gigas) in various categories of predation risk in Denali National Park, Alaska, in 1991. For a particular group size, foraging efficiency declined significantly with distance from cover. Foraging selectivity by moose for diamondleaf willow (Salix planifolia pulchra) also decreased as distance from cover increased. Adult females accompanied by young foraged less efficiently than either females without young or adult males. Group size was positively correlated with distance from cover, which suggests that social grouping in moose is an adaptation to increased predation risk. Surprisingly, group size was inversely related to foraging efficiency because of the overriding negative effects of aggressive behavior. This finding contrasts with behavioral trends in more social ungulates, which display increased foraging efficiency with increasing group size. We suggest that the lowered foraging efficiency in Alaskan moose is a result of the recent evolution of gregarious behavior in this subspecies and that increased foraging efficiency within groups of social ungulates may be a subsequent adaptation rather than an a priori selective advantage that led to the evolution of social behavior."

I studied effects of several risk factors on escape and refuge use and the association between vocalization by fleeing frogs and escape by other individuals nearby. Frogs on shore permitted equally close approach when approached along the shore or on a path perpendicular to shore. Frogs in water were more likely to flee when closer to shore and when approached more rapidly. Time spent submerged after fleeing was uncorrelated with proximity of the predator upon escape. Frogs spent longer submerged when they swam along shore away from the point of entry than when they surfaced directly offshore. Neither distance offshore nor Euclidean distance from the entry point upon emergence was related to time spent submerged. Bullfrogs may use unpredictability of distance and direction moved underwater and of duration of submergence as a strategy that reduce risk upon surfacing. When a focal frog vocalized as it fled, immediate escape by nearby nonfocal frogs was more frequent than when focal frogs (1) escaped without vocalization and (2) neither escaped nor vocalized. These findings are consistent with either alarm calling or benefit to the fleeing individual due to brief delay of attack by a predator. They are inconsistent with several other possible functions of calling during escape. Experimentation is needed to definitively test the hypothesis that calls during escape are alarm signals."

These factors may apply even to highly cryptic species that sometimes must flee. Horned lizards (Phrynosoma) rely on crypsis because of coloration, flattened body form, and lateral fringe scales that reduce detectability. At close range they sometimes squirt blood-containing noxious substances and defend themselves with cranial spines. These antipredatory traits are highly derived, but little is known about the escape behavior of horned lizards. Of particular interest is whether their escape decisions bear the same relationships to predation risk and opportunity costs of escaping as in typical prey lacking such derived defenses. We investigated the effects of repeated attack and direction of predator turning on P. cornutum and of opportunity cost of fleeing during a social encounter in P. modestum. Flight initiation distance was greater for the second of two successive approaches and probability of fleeing decreased as distance between the turning predator and prey increased, but was greater when the predator turned toward than away from a lizard. Flight initiation distance was shorter during social encounters than when lizards were solitary. For all variables studied, risk assessment by horned lizards conforms to the predictions of escape theory and is similar to that in other prey despite their specialized defenses. Our findings show that these specialized, derived defenses coexist with a taxonomically widespread, plesiomorphic method of making escape decisions. They suggest that escape theory based on costs and benefits, as intended, applies very generally, even to highly cryptic prey that have specialized defense mechanisms."

Although rails (Family Rallidae) use the visual display of tail flicking as a warning of vigilance toward predators, how these birds alter their vocal behavior based on perceived predation risk remains little studied. The calls of owls, predatory birds that consume a variety of rallid species and can home in on acoustic cues of their prey, can reduce singing in numerous bird species. We applied remotely activated broadcasts and autonomous recording units to study whether rails in the wetlands of the Lake Calumet region near Chicago, Illinois, would decrease their vocal activity rate following the broadcast of a rallid predator, the Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus). Contrary to predictions, Soras (Porzana carolina) significantly increased vocal activity when exposed to owl vocalizations and decreased vocal activity when exposed to a harmless control. Our results indicate that rails appear to increase their vocal activity as a potential alarm mechanism, likely to reduce predation risk by warning conspecifics."

A multichannel wireless system for monitoring physiological signals of freely moving rats is presented. This system combines electroencephalogram (EEG) and acceleration signals, enabling the study of association between brain and behavior. A combination of EEG and accelerometers eliminates the necessity for complicated video installation as well as time-consuming and tedious analysis of recorded videos. The IEEE 802.15.4 based wireless communication frees the experimental subject from the hassle of wires and reduces wire artifacts during recording. Long-period continuous recording was possible because of the low power feature of the system. Methods for automatic wake-sleep state discrimination and temporal lobe epileptic seizure detection are also proposed to demonstrate the advantages of the system. An accuracy of up to 96.22% for the automatic discrimination of wake-sleep states is an advantage of our system. In addition, the detection of amygdala-kindling temporal lobe seizures reaches 100% with zero false alarms, greatly saving manpower in the identification of temporal lobe epilepsy."

Such disturbance cues evoke consistent low intensity anti-predator responses. In contrast, alarm cues from injured conspecifics often evoke stronger intensity responses in prey animals. In this study, we test the sensory complement hypothesis, which suggests that multiple cues act in an additive or synergistic fashion to provide additional information for risk assessment by prey. In the first experiment, we showed that juvenile rainbow trout pre-exposed to disturbance cues respond to a given concentration of damage-released alarm cues with a higher intensity of response than the trout that were pre-exposed to cues from undisturbed conspecifics. The two cues acted in an additive fashion. In the second experiment, we demonstrated that disturbance cues alone were not enough to elicit a conditioned response to the odour of a novel predator. We also showed that while disturbance cues elicit an increase in the response of trout to alarm cues, this increase does not translate into a stronger learned response to the predator when the predator odour is paired with alarm cues. Future studies should take into account sensory complementation to avoid underestimating the responses of prey to predators."

In the first experiment, we showed that gerbils adapt their evasive tactics to the presence of other individuals to maximize the probability that they will reach shelter quickly. In the second and third experiments, we showed that in the presence of a very mild threatening stimulus, defensive reactions were either enhanced or depressed depending on the behaviour of a nearby conspecific. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate a mechanism by which gerbils can use the behaviour of conspecifics to calibrate thresholds for flight from predators."

Visual field and eye movements of the red-billed starling Spodiopsar sericeus, a passeriform bird with multiple foraging behaviours in different habitats, were determined using ophthalmoscope reflection technology. We found that projection of the bill was below the centre of the binocular field and part of the retinal visual field was impeded by the bill when eyes converged. The vertical extent of the binocular field above the bill was significantly longer than that below the bill. The amplitude of eye movement, mainly occurring in the regions of ventral-nasal and dorsal-temporal, had a very significant effect on the visual field. The widest extent of binocular field was at the elevation below bill when eyes converged forward, but was at the elevation above bill when eyes diverged backward. Our findings suggested that visual field configuration and eye movement in the red-billed starling may be the integrated adaptability to visual demand dependant on their varying foraging behaviour at different habitats."

In this study, we used giving-up density (GUD) to investigate the foraging behaviour of the Peaceful Dove (Geopelia striata) in relation to predation risk. We simulated predation risk by placing feeding patches in grass of various heights, and visual and auditory predator cues were also simulated. GUD was higher near tall grass and minimum GUD of individuals remained similar among different group sizes. Both visual cues and the combination of visual and acoustic cues altered the patterns of GUD significantly, but the effects of the two treatments did not differ from each other. We conclude that changes in vegetation structure and visual predator cues can strongly increase the assessment of predation risk by ground-feeding birds. Grouping behaviour in this species was not entirely a result of clumped food resources in their natural environment but was influenced by anti-predator strategies and birds could maintain higher food intake in more dangerous places when in groups. Our study used a rare, but important, field experimental approach to determine factors that affect foraging behaviour in a bird."

In a producer-scrounger (PS) system, foragers can either search for food themselves (play producer) or search for joining opportunities (play scrounger), but not both at the same time. Empirical evidence is accumulating to show that the joining decision of ground-feeding birds like nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata) can be modeled by a PS game. However some predictions remain to be tested. For instance, foragers are predicted to increase their use of the scrounger tactic as group size increases. Also, one consequence of the incompatibility between producer and scrounger tactics is that the per capita searching efficiency should decrease as the use of scrounger increases. I tested these predictions in an indoor aviary using four flocks of nutmeg mannikins. I manipulated the stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of the scrounger tactic by varying group size and the finder's share. As predicted by PS games, birds increased their use of scrounger as group size increased. Also, the per capita interval between patch discoveries increased and the per capita finding rate decreased as conditions called for a higher SEF of scrounger. I discuss why the decreased searching efficiency observed likely follows from the incompatibility between producer and scrounger tactics rather than from artifacts of the conditions used or from any form of interference."

The observations indicated that Dunlins at night depress vocalization compared with day-feeding birds. Moreover, when Dunlins were approached by a raptor during day-time almost all took flight. In contrast, when Dunlins were disturbed at night only about 60% took flight, while most of the remaining birds froze. It is suggested that depressed vocalization and freezing at night are means to escape detection by owls. How the behavioural dichotomy (freezing and escape) during nocturnal disturbance is accomplished and how it affects the spacing behaviour of night-feeding Dunlins are discussed."

Knowledge about its behavior is scarce and populations in northern Patagonia are declining. This is the first study describing the behavior and summer diurnal activity of two mountain vizcacha colonies under natural conditions. We registered by scan sampling the activities of 15 individuals during the period of 5days. Vizcachas performed typical behaviors of rock specialists and allocated most of their time to foraging near the rock shelter (34%) and resting (26%). Behaviors such as locomotion (16%) and social interactions (10%) were important. Allogrooming (4.5%), vigilance (3%), and dust-bathing (1%) occupied a relatively small percentage of activities. In summer, the diurnal activity presented a bimodal distribution and was inversely related to the mean daytime air temperature, with a maximum peak between 8:00 and 9:00h. Main activities such as foraging, resting, and locomotion were concentrated in the morning and at sunset. The behavioral responses suggest that the activity of this rodent in summer is influenced by thermal conditions. These results are a first important step in order to understand future vizcacha responses to climate change."
"Bender, H",Effectiveness of the eastern grey kangaroo foot thump for deterring conspecifics,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,32,649,655,10.1071/WR04091,2005,"Overabundant wild populations of herbivores often present challenges to primary industry, competing with stock, and damaging crops and property. Eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) are one of seven macropodid species that are considered a problem in agriculture in Australia. Most deterrent devices available commercially use sounds that do not occur in nature (i.e. artificial sounds), which often have a short-lived or no effect on the target species, whereas trials with biologically significant sounds are often more effective and provide greater resistance to habituation. I used a playback trial of an eastern grey kangaroo foot thump, a biologically significant signal that is given in response to a predator and is usually followed by flight. I determined its effectiveness compared with a recording of background noise (control) for deterring kangaroos over a seven-week period. Kangaroos significantly increased their vigilance levels in response to the foot thump, but not in response to the control signal. Just over 60% of kangaroos took flight in response to the foot thump and the control signals, but more kangaroos took flight in the first 3 s when the foot thump was played. The foot thump shows potential as a deterrent of eastern grey kangaroos for primary industry, and is less likely to suffer from habituation because it is a natural sound."

Novel changes to the foodscape, such as human disturbance, can alter behavioral decisions that favor avoidance of perceived risk over food acquisition. Although behavioral changes and population declines often coincide with the introduction of human disturbance, the link(s) between behavior and population trajectory are difficult to elucidate. To identify a pathway by which human disturbance may affect ungulate populations, we tested the Behaviorally Mediated Forage-Loss Hypothesis, wherein behavioral avoidance is predicted to reduce use of available forage adjacent to disturbance. We used GPS collar data collected from migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to evaluate habitat selection, movement patterns, and time-budgeting behavior in response to varying levels of forage availability and human disturbance in three different populations exposed to a gradient of energy development. Subsequently, we linked animal behavior with measured use of forage relative to human disturbance, forage availability, and quality. Mule deer avoided human disturbance at both home range and winter range scales, but showed negligible differences in vigilance rates at the site level. Use of the primary winter forage, sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), increased as production of new annual growth increased but use decreased with proximity to disturbance. Consequently, avoidance of human disturbance prompted loss of otherwise available forage, resulting in indirect habitat loss that was 4.6-times greater than direct habitat loss from roads, well pads, and other infrastructure. The multiplicative effects of indirect habitat loss, as mediated by behavior, impaired use of the foodscape by reducing the amount of available forage for mule deer, a consequence of which may be winter ranges that support fewer animals than they did before development."
"Reinner, Jody R.; Mangel, Marc; Derocher, Andrew E.; Lewis, Mark A.",Modeling optimal responses and fitness consequences in a changing Arctic.,Global Change Biology,25,3450,3461,,2019,"Animals must balance a series of costs and benefits while trying to maximize their fitness. For example, an individual may need to choose how much energy to allocate to reproduction versus growth, or how much time to spend on vigilance versus foraging. Their decisions depend on complex interactions between environmental conditions, behavioral plasticity, reproductive biology, and energetic demands. As animals respond to novel environmental conditions caused by climate change, the optimal decisions may shift. Stochastic dynamic programming provides a flexible modeling framework with which to explore these trade-offs, but this method has not yet been used to study possible changes in optimal trade-offs caused by climate change. We created a stochastic dynamic programming model capturing trade-off decisions required by an individual adult female polar bear (Ursus maritimus) as well as the fitness consequences of her decisions. We predicted optimal foraging decisions throughout her lifetime as well as the energetic thresholds below which it is optimal for her to abandon a reproductive attempt. To explore the effects of climate change, we shortened the spring feeding period by up to 3 weeks, which led to predictions of riskier foraging behavior and higher reproductive thresholds. The resulting changes in fitness may be interpreted as a best-case scenario, where bears adapt instantaneously and optimally to new environmental conditions. If the spring feeding period was reduced by 1 week, her expected fitness declined by 15%, and if reduced by 3 weeks, expected fitness declined by 68%. This demonstrates an effective way to explore a species' optimal response to a changing landscape of costs and benefits and highlights the fact that small annual effects can result in large cumulative changes in expected lifetime fitness."

Microsatellite genotypes for 22-25 loci were obtained for 2945 individuals, and parentage analysis was performed using the program FRANz, including additional offspring-dam associations known only from capture data. Parentage assignments for a subset of 859 individuals were confirmed using an independent medium-density set of single nucleotide polymorphisms. To account for unsampled males in our population, we performed half-sib-full-sib analysis to reconstruct males using the program COLONY, resulting in a final pedigree containing 2957 assigned maternities and 1861 assigned paternities with only one observed case of inbreeding between close relatives. During genotyping, we identified two independently captured 2-year-old males with identical genotypes at all 25 loci, showing-for the first time-a case of monozygotic twinning among polar bears. In addition, we documented six new cases of cub adoption, which we attribute to cub misidentification or misdirected maternal care by a female bereaved of her young. Importantly, none of these adoptions could be attributed to reduced female vigilance caused by immobilization to facilitate scientific handling, as has previously been suggested."
"Scheibe, Klaus M.","BEHAVIOR OF WILD ANIMALS AGAINST HUMANS IN RESERVATIONS, SANCTUARIES, AND HUNTED AREAS - REVIEW AND THEORETICAL APPROACH","WILDLIFE: DESTRUCTION, CONSERVATION AND BIODIVERSITY",,223,237,,2009,"In nearly all hunted areas, game animals fly from humans, avoid being seen by seeking shelter during the day, and have a preference for nocturnal activity. This behavior has widely been assumed to be normal and shyness of all wild animals against humans has been accepted as natural behavior of these species, especially between hunters. On the other hand, in all non-hunted reserves wild animals display a behavior against humans very different from animals under human hunting pressure. This has been described as national park effect. It consists of astonishing tolerance of potential prey animals towards humans, substantially reduced or even completely lacking flight behavior, and distinct daylight activity on open terrains. A general explanation of these effects is given based on the emotions of animals as well as on their learning behavior.The response of inexperienced animals towards humans is based on general anxiety for unpredictable and possibly dangerous events. The emotion of general anxiety has to be distinguished from specific fear. Both processes can be modified by learning from experiences with humans. As hunting is the main cause for mortality in many game populations, hunting strategies will be the key factor to understand the learned behavior of deer towards hunters and tourists in a certain area. Theoretical learning curves are developed for different conditions. They support the importance of game sanctuaries and the development of drawback-free strategies for population regulation.Additionally, the behavior of large predators towards humans can be interpreted based on general anxiety, specific fear, and learning. Recommendations are developed under these aspects for convenient strategies towards these species and to avoid conflicts.To better understand human-wildlife conflicts, more experimental investigations on the learning behavior of the different species are required, Such investigations will open new ways to solve human - wildlife conflicts regarding ethical aspects."

We experimentally compared the risk for females ovipositing solitarily versus in tandem with the male. The backswimmer Notonecta glauca was used as a predator. Owing to the oviposition behaviour of the damselflies, N. glauca only preys on females, therefore it was possible to determine whether the presence of males decreases or increases females' predation risk. Females in tandem were more frequently touched and grasped by N. glauca than solitary females. In most tandem pairs, the female showed the first reaction to the attack and the male responded subsequently. After an attack, most solitary females left the oviposition site but most tandem females stayed. Once grasped by the predator, more solitary females were killed."

Our data are compatible with this hypothesis. Rodents, which constituted the main fox prey, were heterogeneously distributed in time and space. Six foxes (three males and three females) were radiotracked continuously from February 1989 to October 1990 (20 months) and we observed spatial sharing between one male and two or three females, considered as members of a 'spatial group'. Even though their home ranges overlapped between 30 and 100%, members of the group foraged alone and had very few contacts with conspecifics during the night. Furthermore, they partitioned the common home range so that each fox made exclusive use of foraging patches. In contrast, during the daytime, two to four members of the group were frequently in association in a communal resting place. Such associations were observed all year round; they were durable and dynamic. Their advantages were examined. We suggest that they play a role in the maintenance of social cohesion within the group in providing the opportunity for direct contact between foxes. They might also permit increased security through mutual vigilance during resting."

Here, we investigate the variance in reproductive success of male western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), a highly dimorphic primate with long-term male-female associations, using 12.5 years of data collected at Mbeli Bai in northern Congo. Access to mates and offspring survival were both major sources of variance in male reproductive success. Males with larger harems had lower offspring mortality with no apparent reduction in female fertility or observed tenure length, so the size of harems did not seem to be limited by female feeding competition or by the risk of takeovers and infanticide by outsider males. The lower mortality in larger harems may reflect improved vigilance against predators, and females may cluster around males that enhance offspring survival. Thus, this study illustrates how a detailed analysis of the components of male reproductive success can shed light on the interrelated social and ecological aspects that affect it."

Personality may result from individual state characteristics (e.g. morphology or physiology). In turn, these characteristics can lead to differential fitness outcomes for individuals. Cognitive processing of environmental information may be such a characteristic. We developed a subjective personality assessment for Amazona amazonica. We then assessed whether personality predicted a cognitive state difference in attention bias, as measured by the proportion of balks and errors when performing a spatial foraging task in the presence of a passive human observer. Attention biases occur either because individuals attend more quickly to certain environmental stimuli, or because they cannot disengage their attention from such stimuli. Two factors, 'neuroticism' and 'extraversion', accounted for 66% of the total variance in personality. There was individual variation between parrots' scores on both personality factors and both factors were temporally consistent over 1 year. There was a significant correlation between neuroticism and attention bias. Evolutionarily, attention biases are selected for because the fitness cost of failing to attend to potential threats is much greater than the cost of expending energy attending to benign stimuli. Therefore, cognitive biases such as attention bias are logical candidate cognitive states driving stable personality differences. Our findings show that differences in personality in A. amazonica are correlated with attention bias, a biologically relevant difference in cognition.

We first conducted a discrimination experiment to ensure brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) responded appropriately to model predators (a rubber snake) and model conspecifics. We found anoles responded to the snake by suppressing looking and increasing locomotion, a marked difference than their response when presented with a conspecific. Next, we designed a prime and probe experiment to test the salience of social and environmental distractions on brown anoles. The social distraction consisted of a conspecific exemplar that was presented to the focal individual. Environmental distractions were vegetation that was moved at different speeds (ambient or vigorous) near the focal individual. Following 30 seconds of distraction with one of the three treatments, we presented the model snake, which was initially moved to within 1m of a subject, and then moved closer until the subject looked in response to the approaching threat, and then fled. There was no effect of distractor on alert distance, but anoles distracted with the conspecific tolerated a closer approach with the model predator before fleeing than they did to either of the vegetative movements. These results cannot be explained by three other models of risk assessment and suggest that social cues distracted brown anoles more than environmental cues. These results may be generalizable to other social species that must simultaneously monitor conspecifics and assess predation risk."

We presented dummies of the European sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) with changed body coloration, but with all other typical features preserved (body size and shape, beak, eyes, legs), to great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) visiting a winter feeder. A pigeon (Columba livia f.domestica) dummy was used as a harmless control. Neither tit species showed passive avoidance in the presence of a dummy with an artificial, violet-white chequered coloration. They obviously did not consider such an object to be a predator despite the presence of the raptor beak, eyes and talons. Sparrowhawk dummies with the coloration completely changed (altered with those of a harmless European robin) or with the typical colour feature removed (barred pattern on the underparts) were considered to be as dangerous as the unmodified sparrowhawk. We discuss the possibility that the effect of salient raptor-like features such as beak shape, eye coloration, and leg and talons shape overwhelmed the effect of body coloration in these cases. Birds visiting the feeder probably were able to generalize the vigilance towards the sparrowhawk to other realistically coloured dummies, but not to the non-natural dummy."

We studied parental provisioning behaviour in the Vinous-throated Parrotbill Paradoxornis webbianus, a species with an unusual social system that is characterised by flock-living, weak territoriality and variable nesting dispersion. Parental provisioning rate had a positive influence on chick mass gain, suggesting that provisioning rate is an effective measure of parental investment in this species. Males and females fed nestlings at approximately the same rate, and no other carers were observed at nests. Parents coordinated provisioning rates so that they mostly fed chicks synchronously. However, the extent to which parents coordinated provisioning was associated with their social environment, synchrony being positively related to local breeding density and negatively to nearest neighbour distance. The rate at which parents provisioned nestlings showed the same relationships with social measures, being greatest at higher density and when neighbours were closer. Visit rate was also related to chick age, but not to brood size, brood sex ratio, extra pair paternity, laying date, temperature, parents' body characters, time of day or year. We conclude that a breeding pairs' social environment plays an important role in determining parental investment, probably through its effects on the opportunities that parents have for foraging with conspecifics."

Most research on sexual differences in behaviour has been done on sexually size-dimorphic ruminants, whereas little is known about monomorphic species. We tested the activity budget hypothesis which predicts that similar-sized individuals should have similar activity budgets, while dissimilarly sized individuals should differ in their behaviours. We studied African oryx (Oryx gazella (L., 1758)), which are size-monomorphic, to investigate how age, sex, or reproductive state affect their foraging behaviour. We expected that males and females have similar activity budgets, except for lactating females who were expected to spend slightly more time foraging. Younger, smaller animals were predicted to differ in their activity budgets from adults, owing to high energy demands. We predicted that air temperature, vegetation height, and group sizes would be more important in shaping activity budgets and feeding rates than sex or reproductive differences. The sexes did not differ in their behaviour, while subadults spent less time active than adults. Temperature and vegetation height significantly affected their behaviour. We discuss the importance of environmental, as well as intrinsic, factors when studying sexual differences in behaviour and habitat use."

All three species have been considered as potential biological control agents for the Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella, in retail stores and warehouses. Trials were conducted with single naive female parasitoids in 10-cm Petri dishes that were either empty, contained flour, or contained millet. Empty 15-cm Petri dishes, which served as a surface area control, comprised a fourth treatment. Females were allowed to forage for sentinel egg disks for 2 h, after which percentages of parasitism and egg mortality were computed. In addition, behavioral observations were made on a subset of the trials. Trichogramma deion parasitized more eggs than the other two species in the empty dishes and in the dish containing flour. For T deion, rates of parasitism and egg mortality were significantly greater in both the small and large empty dishes than in the small dishes containing flour or millet. Parasitism was consistently low for all three species in the grain-filled dishes. Among species, T ostriniae spent the most time walking, while T pretiosum was the most sedentary. In addition, T pretiosum spent significantly more time on the first egg visited compared with subsequent eggs. T deion may be the best-suited for use as a biological control agent for P. interpunctella. However, the potential negative effects of fine-grain habitat complexity should be taken into account when developing a release protocol for Trichogramma spp. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

As tropospheric NO(2)vertical column densities (VCDs) from TROPOMI have become available since February 2018, this study presents the comparisons of NO(2)data measured by TROPOMI and its predecessor Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over China, together with validation against ground Multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements. At the nationwide scale, we used two different filters performed for the TROPOMI data (named TROPOMI50 and TROPOMI75), and the TROPOMI50 yielded larger values than TROPOMI75. The TROPOMI NO(2)datasets from different filters show consistent spatial patterns with OMI, and the correlation coefficient values were both above 0.93. However, linear regression indicates that NO(2)loadings in TROPOMI is about 2/3 to 4/5 of those in OMI, which is presumably due to a different cloud mask and uncertainties of air mass factors. The absolute difference is prominent over the high pollution areas such as Jing-Jin-Ji region and during winter and autumn, exceeding 0.6 x 10(16)molecules cm(-2)(molec cm(-2)). However, the NO(2)concentrations retrieved from TROPOMI50 in the southern China may be somewhat higher than OMI. When it comes to the local-scale Jing-Jin-Ji hotspot, the analysis focuses on a comparison to TROPOMI75. TROPOMI manifests high quality and exhibits a significantly better performance of representing spatial variability. In contrast, OMI shows fewer effective pixels and does a poor job of capturing local details due to its row anomaly and low resolution. The absolute difference between two datasets shows the same seasonal behavior with NO(2)variation, which is most striking in the winter (0.31 x 10(16)molec cm(-2)) and is lowest in the summer (0.05 x 10(16)molec cm(-2)). Furthermore, the ground MAX-DOAS instrument in Xianghe station, the representative site in Jing-Jin-Ji, is used to assess the skill of satellite retrievals. It turns out that both OMI and TROPOMI underestimate the observations, ranging from 30% to 50%, with OMI being less biased. In spite of the negative drift, the temporal structures of changes derived from OMI and TROPOMI closely match the ground-based records, since the correlation coefficients are above 0.8 and 0.95 for daily and monthly scales, respectively. Overall, TROPOMI NO(2)retrievals are better suited for applications in China as well as the Jing-Jin-Ji hotspot due to its higher spatial resolution, although some improvements are also needed in the near future."
"Sunyer, Pau; Munoz, Alberto; Bonal, Raul; Espelta, Josep M.",The ecology of seed dispersal by small rodents: a role for predator and conspecific scents,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,27,1313,1321,10.1111/1365-2435.12143,2013,"1. Seed-caching rodents play a key role in the ecology of seed dispersal by not only consuming but also dispersing seeds. Rodent foraging behaviour is usually framed within optimal models, which predict that their decisions should maximize food intake and minimize foraging costs. Although predation risk and seed pilferage by conspecifics have been envisaged as two potential costs, their relevance for seed-caching behaviour and seed dispersal has barely been addressed.2. To test the effect of predation and pilferage risk on the patterns of seed predation/dispersal by rodents, we performed a field experiment using a tri-trophic-level model (plant-mice-carnivore; Quercus spp-Apodemus sylvaticus-Genetta genetta) and the scents of the predator and conspecifics as direct cues. The behaviour of mice was analysed with video cameras set for continuous recording on consecutive nights, and we used tagged acorns to assess the patterns of acorn predation and dispersal.3. Our results revealed that rodents were able to discriminate between the scents of genet and conspecifics and modified their seed dispersal behaviour accordingly. Mice spent more time 'sniffing' in rodent cages than in genet cages, where they displayed more 'vigilance and freezing' behaviours. In sites with mice scents, acorns were dispersed at shorter distances and were less predated. Conversely, in sites with genet scents acorn removal was delayed.4. These results show that chemosensory information on predators and conspecifics influences the foraging decisions of seed-caching rodents over short spatial and temporal scales. This might entail cascading effects on the regeneration of plants. In sites where rodents perceive the risk of predation, inefficient foraging behaviour may result in less successful seed dispersal. Conversely, the detection of conspecific scents may increase dispersal efficiency and seedling recruitment.5. Ultimately, the relationships between two distant levels in trophic webs (plants-carnivores) appear intricate, since carnivores may affect seed dispersal by changing the foraging behaviour of their prey (the seed disperser). This indirect relationship should be considered as a new dimension of the ecology of seed dispersal by small rodents."

The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of a predator and auditory cues indicating its presence on the rare of tree seedling (Acer rubrum, Betula lenta) consumption bq meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus). The first of our experiments involved introduction of a stoat (Microtus pennsylvanicus) into an enclosed vole population and the second a playback of recordings of vole distress calls, movements of a stoat and its. vocalizations. In both experiments we manipulated vegetation cover and the availability of Food next to the experimental seedlings to assess the effects of microhabitat under the different risk situations. The results of the first unreplicated experiment suggested an increased rate of seedling predation in the presence of the stoat. Consistent with these results, the playback of predator sounds in the second replicated experiment caused an increased rate of seedling predation compared to control plots with no recordings. A mon ed circle around a seedling station, representing increased risk of predation on the voles. decreased seedling consumption. This effect was modest in the playback treatment. We suggest the results to be due to displacement behavior by time voles exposed to prolonged risk and conflicting demands of foraging and avoiding predators. Alternatively. as suggested by the model of Lima and Bednekoff, prolonged risk of predation forced the voles to decrease their levels of vigilance during low-risk playback breaks. The modest inhibitory effect of cover removal on seedling predation in time playback treatment is consistent with this interpretation. The results confirm recent evidence for trophic cascades mediated by behavioral interactions between predator and prey. They are novel in suggesting that the presence of predation risk can increase the inhibitory effects of consumers on their resources."
"Shannon, Graeme; McKenna, Megan F.; Wilson-Henjum, Grete E.; Angeloni, Lisa M.; Crooks, Kevin R.; Wittemyer, George",Vocal characteristics of prairie dog alarm calls across an urban noise gradient,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,31,393,400,10.1093/beheco/arz200,2020,"Increasing anthropogenic noise is having a global impact on wildlife, particularly due to the masking of crucial acoustical communication. However, there have been few studies examining the impacts of noise exposure on communication in free-ranging terrestrial mammals. We studied alarm calls of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) across an urban gradient to explore vocal adjustment relative to different levels of noise exposure. There was no change in the frequency 5%, peak frequency, or duration of the alarm calls across the noise gradient. However, the minimum frequency-a commonly used, yet potentially compromised metric-did indeed show a positive relationship with noise exposure. We suspect this is a result of masking of observable call properties by noise, rather than behavioral adjustment. In addition, the proximity of conspecifics and the distance to the perceived threat (observer) did affect the frequency 5% of alarm calls. These results reveal that prairie dogs do not appear to be adjusting their alarm calls in noisy environments but likely do in relation to their social context and the proximity of a predatory threat. Anthropogenic noise can elicit a range of behavioral and physiological responses across taxa, but elucidating the specific mechanisms driving these responses can be challenging, particularly as these are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Our research sheds light on how prairie dogs appear to respond to noise as a source of increased risk, rather than as a distraction or through acoustical masking as shown in other commonly studied species (e.g., fish, songbirds, marine mammals).Lay Summary: Songbirds, amphibians, and marine mammals have been shown to alter their vocalizations in noisy environments. We conducted one of the first studies on the effects of noise on communication in a terrestrial mammal-the prairie dog. Interestingly, prairie dogs did not appear to adjust their alarm call frequency or duration with increasing noise exposure, while our previous research demonstrated that their behavioral response to noise is similar to elevated predation risk-reduced foraging and increased vigilance."
"Malan, G; Jenkins, AR",Territory and nest defence in polyandrous pale chanting goshawks: do co-breeders help?,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,31,170,176,,1996,"The behaviour of polyandrous and monogamous pale chanting goshawks Melierax canorus was investigated to determine if co-breeders, by defending the territory and nest contents, helped to increase the fitness of polyandrous trios. Polyandrous trios consisted of a female and male breeder, as well as a subordinate co-breeding male. Pale chanting goshawk males performed most of the interspecific territorial maintenance duties, as well as participating in aggressive intraspecific interactions against other males on territory borders. Intraspecific territorial interactions were almost exclusively recorded in high-quality habitat, Karroid Broken Veld, and probably functioned in the defence of foraging habitat and potential mates. In this habitat, males of polyandrous families largely occupied exclusive sections of a territory. It is suggested that the cost of defending territories in Karroid Broken Veld was offset by the co-breeder's contribution to high-risk, intraspecific territorial defence. During the nestling period females of polyandrous trios stayed at nesting sites for longer periods than did monogamous females and all males, enabling these females to guard the nest and act as sentinels. Predation of nestlings was recorded at the nests of monogamous pairs, but not at those of polyandrous trios. Go-breeders did not guard the nesting site but contributed directly to nest defence by either coming to the female's aid when solicited, or attacking potential predators when present at the nesting site. Go-breeders may also have helped indirectly, through activities such as provisioning prey to females that relieved them of their hunting duties. We suggest that the female's nest guarding and the resulting lower nest predation may hold reproductive and fitness benefits for polyandrous breeders."

However, the generally poor knowledge on their life history and taxonomy has obscured their role in the biological-control of these pests. A comprehensive survey in vineyards and in banana, citrus, persimmon and pomegranate orchards throughout Israel, using more than 670 sentinel baits, revealed five species of gall midges. All species fed in the laboratory on Planococcus citri (Risso) and Phenacoccus solani Ferris, and in trials with Diadiplosis multifila (Felt) no preference for either of these mealybug species was found. Larvae fed on all stages of the mealybugs, and the gall midges completed their life cycle within 10-20 days. Adult peak activity of the five studied species was in summer, with low numbers obtained from baits in winter and fall. No difference in overall numbers of gall midges was found among crops, and differences in species composition among sites are attributed to geographic and climatic conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This is shown by compiling retrospective data on fish catches and anecdotal observations, which in some cases date back to the mid-19th century. The AMO is defined as the de-trended mean of North Atlantic (0-60 degrees N) sea surface temperature anomalies. However, it is not primarily the temperature which drives the dynamics of the small pelagic fish populations. Instead, the AMO seems to be a proxy for complex processes in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system of the North Atlantic. This is manifested in large-scale changes in strength and direction of the current system that move water masses around the North Atlantic and likely involves the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the Mediterranean Overflow Water (MOW) and the subpolar gyre (SPG). The contractions and expansions of the SPG apparently play a key role. This was particularly obvious in the mid-1990s, when the SPG abruptly contracted with the result that warm subtropical water masses moved to the north and east. Small pelagic fish populations in the eastern North and Central Atlantic, including those in the Mediterranean responded quickly by changing abundances and migrating northwards. It seems that the complex ocean-atmosphere changes in the mid-1990s, which are described in the text in detail, caused a regime shift in the ecosystems of the eastern North and Central Atlantic and the small pelagic clupeoid fish populations are the sentinels of this shift.

Observations were made at three nests during 1995-1997. Walling-in of the females commenced in the first week of March. One female remained incarcerated for 77 days, two of three broods completed fledging around May 20 (1995, 1997). Details on fledging of the female and her brood and postfledging care by both parents are reported.The food of the males at two nests was ca. 98% fruits and 2% invertebrates. The plants exploited comprised at least 14 species. Over a third of the fruits delivered were figs of a small number of species.Two males had average feeding rates of 0.56 and 0.88 times per hour respectively, and fed 1 to 66 (median 8) items per feeding visit at the nest. The hourly feeding rate increased after hatching, but the composition of the diet did not change noticeably. As a rule, food items were delivered singly and, during one visit, in runs of one, or rarely up to 3, species.In the three weeks following vacation of the nest, the male appeared to be the sole food provider while the female stayed continually with the 3 young (as sentinel?) in the vicinity of the nest.The nest environs were defended by the male against Tarictic Hornbills (Penelopides panini panini). Six vocalisations of the parents are mentioned. One was used in territorial skirmishes with Tarictic Hornbills.With perhaps less than 30 pairs of the Writhed-bill surviving, the future for the species looks bleak. Only drastic conservation measures can prevent the species' demise. Some have been started by the PESCP."

The land deformation may cause several impacts on the environment and human life. A good understanding of the deformation behaviour of the soil is essential to mitigate risks on the infrastructure and environment. In this study, a radar interferometry is carried out to analyse the mobility of an urban and suburban area of Greater Tunis region. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique has been proven to be an effective methodology for detecting and monitoring soil displacement with millimetre accuracy and also, improving our understanding of the current deformations in the study area. Indeed, the application of differential SAR interferometry made it possible to determine the origin of the surface deformations related to natural or anthropic phenomena. In this paper, the interferometric method of small baseline subset (SBAS) developed by Berardino et al. 2002has been chosen, in order to monitor the spatial and temporal pattern of the deformation phenomena in Greater Tunis region. The analysis of Envisat ASAR (2003-2007, descending satellite orbit) and Sentinel 1B (2016-2018, ascending satellite orbit) SAR data allowed us to create deformation velocity maps associated with line of sight displacement time series. The results obtained by this method showed the existence of subsidence phenomenon in the urban areas (Tunis City) as well as in the rural areas (Mornag plain). In the first site (Tunis City), the subsidence rate reaches up to 13.98 mm/year and 19 mm/year during 2003-2007 and 2016-2018, respectively. The ground deformation that is detected around the region of Tunis Lake and Sebkhet Essijoumi, is probably due to the nature of the highly compressible and thickness alluvial deposits and whose substratum depth sometimes reaches more than 60 m. In the second studied site, ground subsidence was identified in the whole plain of Mornag. Indeed, the comparison between piezometric data and time series deformations shows that the trend of soil subsidence is coherent with the dynamic change in groundwater levels. Furthermore, the analysis of velocity deformation, geological data and hydrogeological information allows us to associate all the detected settlement patterns to groundwater overexploitation and compressible alluvium all over the plain. This overexploitation of groundwater in Mornag plain is mainly caused by the expansion of agricultural and industrial activities and the decrease in annual rainfall in recent years (from 2003 to 2018)."

Conducted in the San Diego Zoo, this study partially replicates an existing study on human-animal relationships, which focused on familiarity effects on the human-directed behavior of great apes residing in the Toronto Zoo. Such a replication in a new location and with different individuals is necessary to expand sample size and to better understand how ontogeny and living environment influence human-directed ape behavior. All-occurrence sampling of human-directed behavior was used to gather data on two gorilla groups and one orangutan group, all housed at the San Diego Zoo. The aim was to compare ape-initiated behaviors toward zoo staff with apeinitiated visitor-directed behavior, in accordance with predictions of the Human-Animal Relationship (HAR) model. Overall, human-directed behaviors were more frequent toward visitors than toward staff, mainly caused by increased visitor-directed visual behavior, specifically brief glances. Given that visual monitoring has been seen as fearful behavior, potentially related to predator monitoring, this would confirm the expectation that lack of familiarity will lead to increased visual vigilance. However, the visitor-directed visual behaviors may not be antagonistic or fearful. Considering the specific behaviors and exhibit designs, curiosity may be an equally likely explanation in this context. Aiming to also understand whether these groups exhibited species differences in human-directed behavior, it was found that orangutans engaged in more affiliative behavior overall than gorillas. Comparing our results with the previous study, we conclude that while effects of familiarity are present, those effects are modulated by both individual ontogeny and exhibit design. While the HAR model is partially supported, additional factors may need to be included to fully interpret the observed behavior. Additional research is needed to further understand the effects of species, sex, and ontogeny on the predictions of the HAR model."
"Franova, Sandra",General activity and protective behaviour of the European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus) in semi-natural condition of zoological gardens.,Journal of Central European Agriculture,14,1243,1260,,2013,"Focus of this research is on two of the basic forms of European ground squirrel's behaviour in the semi-natural conditions of zoological gardens - general activity and protective behavior. Our main goal was to perform a complex analysis of the ground squirrel's behaviour living in captivity and to compare the various categories of behaviour on a set timeline. We performed our research throughout the span of two years (2011 - 2012), during which we observed two separate ground squirrel colonies (A, B). We took our compiled information and subjected these to a thorough statistical analysis and main tools of comparison. Based on a long-term observation and analysis of the results, we were able to gather very detailed information about the two categories of the ground squirrel's behavior as well as the various periods on the timeline, which were worked into the ethogram of the ground squirrels living in captivity. The results from 2011 confirmed that the behavior of the ground squirrel bred in captivity (both observed categories) - in the same way as was observed in the wild - reaches two peaks with raised frequencies in manifestation of given behavior, mostly in the daily time periods, the first from 9 am to 11 am and the second from 2.30 pm to 5 pm. We also noted a change in 2012, when there was a reconstruction nearby the aviaries. These reconstructive activities influenced the behavior (significant decrease of activity) of the ground squirrels in the presence of the assigned workers approximately until 3 pm, from which time - also in connection with the lessening of the worker's presence - the ground squirrels activity in their aviaries begun to rapidly rise, which held on until 5 pm. The peak of protective behavior in 2012 has reached higher levels than the peak in 2011, which we attribute to their vigilance after the previous presence of people. Our results may serve as a basis for improvement of the life conditions of the ground squirrels bred in captivity as well as their possible relocation into the wild. All gained information has also an impact on the future management of the agriculture areas with present colonies of ground squirrels and their development."
"Pickup, Helena E.; Dwyer, Cathy M.",Breed differences in the expression of maternal care at parturition persist throughout the lactation period in sheep,APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,132,33,41,10.1016/j.applanim.2011.03.010,2011,"Maternal care plays an important role in the survival of offspring in mammals. In the ewe initial maternal care is expressed by nurturing the young and formation of an exclusive olfactory bond with the lamb. After the neonatal period, maternal care is associated with co-operation with sucking interactions, maintenance of a close ewe-lamb relationship, communication with lambs, vigilance and a tendency to seek absent lambs. Two breeds of ewe, Suffolk and Scottish Blackface, have previously been shown to differ in their expression of early maternal care, and in lamb survival. It was hypothesised that these differences in the expression of maternal behaviour would persist throughout the lactation period and continue to be expressed in other aspects of maternal care. The maternal behaviour of 32 primiparous ewes (18 Suffolk, 14 Blackface) was observed from birth until weaning at 12 weeks of age. As shown previously, Blackface ewes spent more time grooming their lambs than Suffolk ewes (P < 0.001), and were more cooperative with the early sucking behaviour of their offspring (P < 0.01). Blackface ewes were significantly closer to their lambs from birth and throughout the lactation period (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between breeds in maternal vocal communication with their lambs, however, Blackface ewes were significantly more vigilant (head alert) than Suffolk ewes from week 4 of lactation onwards (P < 0.01). The lambs of Suffolk ewes had a significantly higher frequency of sucking bouts (P < 0.05) than lambs of Blackface ewes in the first weeks of lactation. However. Blackface ewes accepted a greater proportion of lamb sucking attempts than Suffolk ewes (P < 0.01), and these sucking bouts were longer than with Suffolk ewes (P < 0.05). The results therefore show that differences in the expression of maternal care seen in the initial post partum period in sheep persist throughout lactation, and would be expected to contribute to lamb survival.

Several indicators are currently used to evaluate plant growth, based on in situ data collection or remote sensing. In this study, we propose a multi-scale approach to assess and interpret plant growth indicators in vineyard systems. We not only monitor plant growth and eco-physiology in-vivo during cultivation, but also reconstruct past eco-physiological behavior by transferring the approach of dendro-sciences, typical of the forest science domain, to viticulture. More specifically, we extract anatomical and stable isotope traits (linked with hydraulic and resource efficiency parameters) from tree-ring series to evaluate plant plasticity to past fluctuations in environmental conditions and to changes in the vineyard management. We also check whether the reconstructed eco-physiological behavior corresponds with the indexes obtained from the retrospective analysis of space-borne and UAVs data."

The latter was observed in five species, across three subgenera, most species exhibiting grasping fight behavior. Both fight patterns usually started with leg touching/pushing, followed by mounting and grasping. Fights usually ended with grasping, but in the claw-extending pattern, lateral extension of the chelipeds in both combatants occurred after grasping. Fighting behavior between females could be divided into two patterns; leg-intertwining fight and leg-extending fight, the latter being observed only in two species of subgenus Macrophthalmus. Most species exhibited leg-intertwining fight. Male waving display could be classified into four patterns, including vertical non-forward-pointing type, vertical forward-pointing type, lateral non-forward-pointing type and lateral forward-pointing type, depending upon in cheliped movement. The differences between the four waving patterns involve the chelipeds being moved either vertically or laterally, and extended forward while raised or not. Lateral movement was observed in only three species, M. banzai, M. erato and M. quadratus, most species exhibiting vertical movement. Forward-pointing movements were observed in four species, but were absent in all species of subgenus Mareotis and two species of subgenus Macrophthalmus. The most common waving display was the vertical non-forward-pointing type. Mating behavior of six species was observed (surface mating). Under-ground mating, reported for other macrophthalmine crabs, was not observed during the field observations."

G.",Consistency of flight speed and its correlation to productivity and to personality in Bos taurus beef cattle,APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,99,193,204,10.1016/j.applanim.2005.05.012,2006,"Flight speed (FS) has been used as a measure of temperament and is correlated with weight gain in Bos indicus cattle. However, no work to date has investigated this relationship in Bos taurus cattle and, more importantly, there have been no attempts to understand the individual differences in personality which cause individual differences in FS and average daily gain (ADG). Thus, the objectives of this study were to: (a) evaluate the reliability of the FS test by repeated measurements, (b) determine the correlation of FS to ADG, and (c) examine the correlation of FS and ADG to personality traits measured in a social separation test. FS measurements for 61 Aberdeen Angus crossbred heifers were repeated three times at 4-week intervals (FS1-3), and a fourth time (FS4) immediately following FS3. The relationship between FS and ADG over 8 weeks was quadratic (P < 0.05), with those animals having particularly high FS showing the lowest ADG over the study period. FS increased slightly over time (FS1-3 = 3.20, 3.36, 3.84 m/s, respectively), which may be attributed to either increased fearfulness or animal growth. The monthly measures of FS were significantly correlated (FS1,2: r = 0.50; FS2,3: r = 0.63), which may reflect individual consistency. The two FS measures taken within a day did not differ and were correlated (FS4 = 4.03 m/s; FS3,4: r = 0.84). A 15 min social separation test was conducted once using a subset of 36 animals. Animals having higher FS showed more locomotion (r(s) = 0.34) and changed between behavioural states more often (r(s) = 0.35), possibly reflecting an agitated state during the social separation test. The shorter duration of immobility (r(s) = -0.34) and the lower frequency of vigilance (r(s) = -0.40), along with the higher locomotion (r(s) = 0.41) of cattle with higher ADG, may indicate an absence of fear during a social separation test. In conclusion, the results indicate that animals that differed in their FS also exhibited differences in their personality traits, which may be related to differences in their physiological characteristics resulting in differences in ADG.

The role of the water rat in the S. mansoni cycle would be substantiated if one could prove that these rodents acquire the parasite during their own activity time, a completely independent time schedule of human activities. To pursue this goal, we performed two field experiments in the municipality of Sumidouro, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a schistosomiasis endemic area where N. squamipes is found naturally infected. One experiment was devised as a series of observations of activity time of the water-rat. The other experiment was a test of the occurrence of late transmission of S. mansoni to the water-rat. The daily activity pattern showed that the water-rat is active chiefly just after sunset. At both diurnal and late exposition essays the water-rat sentinels got infected by S. mansoni. These findings clarify ecological and behavioral components necessary to the adaptation of S. mansoni to the water-rat as a non human definitive host and the existence of a transmission cycle involving this animals as a reservoir."

Differences in vegetation structure between male, female and non-used locations during reproduction were examined and used to build a presence/absence model for each sex. Ten variables were measured in each location, extracting two PCA factors (PC1: a visibility-shelter gradient; PC2: a gradient in food availability) used as response variables in GLM explanatory models. Both factors significantly differed between female, male and control locations. Neither study site nor phenology was significant. Logistic regression was used to model male and female presence/absence. Female presence was positively associated to cover of ground by vegetation litter, as well as overall vegetation cover, and negatively to vegetation density over 30 cm above ground. Male presence was positively related to litter cover and short vegetation and negatively to vegetation density over 30 cm above ground. Models showed good global performance and robustness. Female microhabitat selection and distribution seems to be related to the balance between shelter and visibility for surveillance. Male microhabitat selection would be related mainly to the need of conspicuousness for courtship. Accessibility to food resources seems to be equally important for both sexes. Differences suggest ecological sexual segregation resulting from different ecological constraints. These are the first detailed results on vegetation structure selection in both male and female little bustards, and are useful in designing management measures addressing vegetation structure irrespective of landscape composition. Similar microhabitat approaches can be applied to manage the habitat of many declining farmland birds. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."

Historically extirpated from the region, wild populations of this sentinel carnivore appear to have made a recovery in recent years. Utilizing a citizen-science network paired with field investigations in 2012 and 2013, we documented 1374 River Otter observations across 8 of 9 San Francisco Bay Area counties. We demonstrate that River Otters are reproducing, and report here on the 1st sightings in decades in Alameda, San Francisco, and Santa Clara counties indicating a possible gradual expansion of the species' range southward. Within our Intensive Study Area in coastal Marin County, conservatively estimated densities ranged from 0.21 to 0.32 River Otters/km, with otters inhabiting a range of habitats from freshwater to marine. A pilot assessment of disease and mortality indicates that otters are being exposed to pathogens such as Vibrio and that observable mortality was largely due to car-strikes. We also report on timing of mating, timing of pup-juvenile emergence, and pup-juvenile production. Despite large-scale ecosystem restoration actions underway across the San Francisco Bay Area, River Otters have been overlooked by resource managers. Being apex carnivores that not only directly benefit from restoration actions but also likely play a significant role in the outcome of recovery actions focused on endangered salmonids and waterfowl, we strongly recommend attention to their potential role as a keystone species in the San Francisco Bay Area."

One of the key theoretical and empirical findings underlying this conclusion is that cooperative systems have a degree of kin structure, often the product of delayed dispersal, that facilitates interactions with relatives. However, recent population genetic studies have revealed that many non-cooperative animals also have kin-structured populations, providing more cryptic opportunities for kin selection to operate. In this article, I first review the evidence that kin structure is widespread among non-cooperative vertebrates, and then consider the various contexts in which kin selection may occur in such taxa, including: leks, brood parasitism, creches, breeding associations, territoriality and population dynamics, foraging and predator deterrence. I describe the evidence that kin-selected benefits arise from interacting with kin in each of these contexts, notwithstanding the potential costs of kin competition and inbreeding. I conclude that as the tools required to determine population genetic structure are readily available, measurement of kin structure and the potential for kin selection on a routine basis is likely to reveal that this process has been an important driver of evolutionary adaptation in many non-cooperative as well as cooperative species."

Field trials were carried out in Portugal, Italy and Israel. The effect of LS on the parasitism rate of the wasp was determined by exposing sentinel mealybugs combined with pheromone dispensers impregnated with LS, in comparison with other baits: lavandulyl isovalerate (LI); planococcyl acetate (PAc); and unbaited control traps. In addition, in order to study the host location behavior of A. sp. near pseudococci, pheromone dispensers were placed at three different distances: inside the trap, 30 or 60 cm away from the trap. The number of parasitoid females inside the traps, the number of parasitized mealybugs, and the number of days required for the first parasitoid emergence were recorded. The response of A. sp. near pseudococci females to different doses of LS (25-1350 mu g) was also evaluated using sticky plate traps. The rate of mealybug parasitism by A. sp. near pseudococci was significantly increased by LS in the three parasitoid populations. PAc and LI had no significant effect on the wasp parasitism rate in most of the trials. However, the Italian population of the parasitoid responded to PAc, showing apparently a different behavioral pattern. The number of parasitoid females trapped did not significantly differ between tested doses of LS. The use of LS as an arrestant in host location by the A. sp. near pseudococci female is discussed.

Foragers, therefore, face a challenge to balance between two conflicting tasks, namely energy intake and safety. Flight initiation distance (FID, defined as the distance between a prey and a predator when the prey starts to flee) has been widely measured in many taxa to study such economic trade-offs. However, FID may also be affected by limitations on the prey's ability to detect predators, especially when there is visual obstruction caused by surrounding vegetation. Although both vegetation cover and vegetation height may contribute to such obstruction, the effect of vegetation height on FID has not been well studied. In this study, we explored the effects of vegetation height, vegetation cover and distance to refuge on FID in free-living Daurian ground squirrels (Spermophilus dauricus) inhabiting a grassland in Inner Mongolia, China. Multiple linear regressions suggested that both vegetation height and distance to refuge significantly affected FID in S. dauricus. Ground squirrels fled earlier when vegetation was low or when foraging farther away from a refuge. No significant effect of vegetation cover on FID was detected. Our results have implications for ecologically based pest control, and FID may be used as an effective and easy-to-use behavioral indicator in wildlife management."

Individuals attracted to the colony by the presence of conspecifics may then occupy nest sites with different habitat characteristics to that of established breeders and, as a result, experience lower nesting success. We studied a rapidly growing colony of Svalbard pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus to determine any such changes in nest site characteristics and nesting success of newly used nest locations. Svalbard pink-footed geese are a long-lived migratory species that breeds during the short Arctic summer and whose population has doubled since the early 2000s to c. 80,000. From 2003 to 2012, nest numbers increased over fivefold, from 49 to 226, with the majority (range 57-82 %) established within 30 m of another nest (total range 1-164 m). Most nests, particularly during the early stages of colony growth, shared common features associated with better protection against predation and closer proximity to food resources; two factors thought key in the evolution of colony formation. As nest numbers within the colony increased, new nests occupied locations where visibility from the nest was restricted and foraging areas were further away. Despite these changes in nest site characteristics, the nesting success of geese using new sites was not lower than that of birds using older nests. Hence, we propose that nesting in dense aggregations may offset any effects of suboptimal nest site characteristics on nesting success via the presence of more adults and the resultant increased vigilance towards predators."

Past research on mammalian responses to urbanization has emphasized predators, but prey species could respond to additional factors including variation in predation risk. We examined spatial heterogeneity in real and perceived risk across an urbanization gradient by comparing survival rates, causes of mortality, and antipredator behavior of adult woodchucks (Marmota monax (L., 1758)) within an agricultural landscape in Illinois from 2007 to 2009. Survival rates were higher, and effects of urbanization were stronger, during the inactive season. Rural woodchucks primarily died from predation or costs associated with hibernation, whereas urban woodchucks mainly died from vehicle collisions or unknown reasons. Mean levels of antipredator behavior were unrelated to urbanization, but among-individual variation in vigilance levels increased in urban areas, which may reflect increased spatial variation in disturbance levels within urban environments. Distances from burrows while foraging and flight initiation distances also were unrelated to urbanization, suggesting that urban woodchucks were not strongly habituated to humans. Our research provides insights into demographic and behavioral responses to urbanization, and constraints to responses, by an urban-adapter species."

Since such calls could nevertheless attract acoustically oriented predators, the cost of predator attraction must be outweighed by factors beneficial to the caller. In this field study we elicited low-risk alarm calls by temporarily catching wintering adult male great tits Parus major at feeders both within and outside their territories. We tested whether the alarm calls of dominant males can be explained in terms of mate warning, reciprocal altruism or notifying the predator of detection. If alarms are intended to warn mates, males accompanied by their mates should give alarm calls both within and outside home range, even if other permanent flock members are absent. If alarms are to be explained by reciprocal altruism, male great tits should give low-risk alarm calls when accompanied by permanent flock members other than mate within and not outside of the home-range. If alarm calling is a message to a predator, males should call when foraging alone. We found that male great tits gave low-risk alarm calls when accompanied by their mates, independent of feeder location. They also gave low-risk alarm calls within home ranges in the presence of other permanent flock members when mates were absent. In contrast, only a few males gave calls when foraging alone within their home ranges, or when in the company of unfamiliar great tits outside their usual home-range. The results suggest that the utterance of alarm calls may be explained as mate protection and reciprocal altruism among familiar individuals."

Foraging can be a risky behavior and animals generally face a tradeoff between food consumption and predation risk. We predicted that the degree to which animals invest in current versus future reproduction (i.e. life history strategy) would determine how they approach this tradeoff. We manipulated food abundance in wetlands to assess whether life history theory could explain risk taking among females of five duck species with respect to foraging. We found evidence consistent with our prediction based on life history theory; species with a faster life history strategy were willing to engage in riskier behavior, by feeding more intensively, for a greater food reward. Females from species with faster life history strategies devoted 25% more time to feeding when in high food density treatment plots versus control plots. The percentage of time that females from species with slower life history strategies devoted to feeding was not affected by food density. These findings contribute to our understanding of life history theory and represent a possible mechanism to explain differences in life history strategies among species."

The light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), was discovered in Berkeley (CA, USA) in 2006, leading to an incursion response that included this technology. In this study, we assessed factors affecting mating success from a bisex release of irradiated moths: effects of radiation dose on male multiple mating, male flight competition, female sex pheromone titre and attractiveness of irradiated females to males, and identification of successful mating in vineyards of either irradiated or wild males (identified by isotope analysis of spermatophores from sentinel females). There was a significant negative relationship between male radiation dose and mating frequency. In head-to-head flights of irradiated males against non-irradiated males to a pheromone lure in a wind tunnel, irradiated males reached the lure first only 31% of the time. With increasing radiation dose, the production of the major sex pheromone component in females, (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate, dropped, from 0.7 +/- 0.1ng per female in non-irradiated females to 0.2 +/- 0.07ng per female when irradiated at 300Gy. Male catch was reduced to 11% of control females in traps containing females irradiated at 300Gy. Isotope analysis of spermatophores found in the bursa copulatrix of females indicated that mating success of irradiated males inside the live (entry-only) traps containing virgin females was lower (13.1 +/- 3.3%) than suggested by male catch (21.2 +/- 3.8%) in pheromone traps, the current standard for assessing field competitiveness. Impacts of irradiation on male and female moth fitness should be taken into account to improve estimates of irradiated to wild male E.postvittana overflooding ratios needed for population suppression."

In addition to allowing communication with conspecifics, alarm calls are a valuable source of information for eavesdropping heterospecifics. However, although eavesdropping has been experimentally demonstrated in over 70 species, we know little about exactly what information eavesdroppers gain from heterospecific alarm calls. Here, we investigated whether Australian magpies, Cracticus tibicen, extract relevant information about the type of threat from functionally referential alarm calls given by noisy miners, Manorina melanocephala. Miner aerial alarm calls signal a predator in flight, whereas mobbing calls signal a terrestrial or perched predator. We therefore tested whether magpies gain information on the elevation of expected danger. We first confirmed, by measuring bill angles on video, that magpie head orientation changes appropriately with differences in the elevation of a conspicuous moving object. We then conducted a field experiment that measured magpie bill angle in response to playback of miner aerial and mobbing alarm calls. The maximum and mean bill angles were higher in response to aerial than to mobbing calls, suggesting that magpies use information from miner alarms to search visually at appropriate elevations for the specific type of danger. Magpies were also vigilant for longer after aerial alarm calls that followed mobbing calls, implying perception of an escalating threat level. Our work shows that individuals can gain information on the type or location of danger from heterospecific alarm calls, which is likely to increase the effectiveness of antipredator responses.

The Risk Hypothesis posits that the costs of intergroup conflict create a landscape of fear, discouraging the use of such shared areas. To test this hypothesis, we observed the behavior of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in central vs. peripheral areas of their home ranges. If capuchins perceive areas of home range overlap as risky, we predicted they would change activity budgets, vocalization rates, and foraging behavior in these areas. A spatially explicit behavioral comparison based on nearly 100 h of focal follows revealed that capuchins socialize less in the periphery (vs. the center) of their home range. Time spent resting, foraging, and engaging in vigilance, as well as vocalization rates, varied in consistent ways across all four study groups, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Fruit trees near range borders (vs. the center) contained more ripe fruit, and groups spent more time in these trees, with more individuals entering to feed and consuming more fruits. However, capuchins did not alter their foraging behavior in potentially risky peripheral areas in a manner consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory: intake rates at patch departure were not significantly lower and groups depleted trees to a greater extent along the periphery vs. in the center of their range. These results suggest that while peripheral areas are perceived as risky and this landscape of fear contributes to behavioral changes, they also provide resources whose value may outweigh the cost of intergroup encounters."

Reintroduction efforts at Majete Wildlife Reserve, Malawi, have resulted in rapid population increases, but little is known about how such populations resemble natural populations socially or behaviourally, and what those attributes may reveal about restoration success. Incorporating behavioural knowledge into conservation efforts is an important tool for managing the effects of habitat fragmentation and resource competition. The aim of this study was to quantify the daylight time budget of both family and bachelor bands of reintroduced plains zebra to determine if such behaviours resembled those found in natural populations, and to provide insights into seasonal behavioural patterns that could inform management strategies. We found that feeding occupied the largest percentage (mean = 41.8 % [plus or minus] 2.36) of family band daylight time budgets, followed by resting (18.5 % [plus or minus] 2.21), locomotion (10.9 % [plus or minus] 1.05), vigilance (7.5 % [plus or minus] 0.92), maintenance (2.7 % [plus or minus] 0.92) and social behaviour (1.4 0 /0 [plus or minus] 0.33). Bachelor bands spent the majority of their daylight time being vigilant (27.0 % [plus or minus] 2.72), followed by locomotion (21.0 % [plus or minus] 2.05), feeding (18.4 % [plus or minus] 2.32), resting (15.4 % [plus or minus] 2.85), maintenance (6.4 % [plus or minus] 1.86) and social behaviour (2.4 % [plus or minus] 0.68). The time budgets of zebra in this restored population are generally congruent with those reported in natural populations of plains zebra. Seasonal variation in time spent feeding and resting, locomotion, and change in body condition, however, suggest that dry season resources may negatively impact zebra in the miombo savannah woodlands. These results provide important insights into resource implications for zebra in an ecological system with many large ungulate species that compete for forage, and may assist managers with resource management strategies."

Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) are highly social rodents that inhabit burrows with two species of mongoose, but the benefits of these interspecific associations to ground squirrels remain unresolved. We compared the behavior of squirrels while solitary, with conspecifics, and in the presence of suricates (Suricata suricatta) and yellow mongooses (Cynictis pencillatus). Squirrels spent less time alert and more time feeding when suricates were present, but increased vigilance in the presence of yellow mongooses. In a series of mobbing trials with a puff adder (Bitis arietans), a common predator of all three species, Cape ground squirrels were the most active in mobbing the snake. Our results suggest that Cape ground squirrels benefit from associating with suricates, but not necessarily with yellow mongooses. Both mongoose species benefit from the burrowing activities of the squirrels for thermoregulation and escape from predators, and a suite of other organisms may similarly benefit from the habitat modifications by Cape ground squirrels, suggesting they could be considered ecosystem engineers of the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. Thus, the association between Cape ground squirrels and suricates appears mutually beneficial, whereas yellow mongooses may merely be commensals of the squirrels."

In particular, the trade-off between gaining food and avoiding predation has been the subject of much attention. Here, I investigate the preferences for foraging sites in the group-living Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus), focusing on how energy intake is traded against proximity to cover. The main predator of this species relies primarily on visual cues to locate its prey, and thus, foraging in open habitat should be associated with higher exposure to a predator. Jays generally chose to feed in cover, a pattern that became stronger toward late winter. In particular, the strength of this preference varied with age, relatedness to other group members, and large-scale habitat quality. Adult territory holders and their retained offspring demonstrated similar preference for cover over seasons, a pattern not observed in nonrelated immigrants that showed no response to either forest structure or season. These results suggest that the benefits of parental nepotism enables retained offspring to take less risk, in regards to predators while foraging compared to similar-aged immigrants whose foraging options are constrained by social interference. Also, this study indicates that large-scale forest structure influences small-scale individual behavioral decisions."

We examined the effects of wolf recolonisation and density modifications on group size and use of safe areas by Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) in Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), where no large terrestrial predator has been present for about a century. We documented that, in a few years, the variation in the factors affecting the landscape of fear caused significant modifications in ibex behavioural patterns that could not be accounted for by density changes only. Male groups decreased in size and moved closer to safer areas. The distance of female groups from refuge sites, instead, was not affected, and their propensity to live in groups was scarcely modified. Behavioural modifications likely caused a reduction in nutrient intake in adult male ibex, as they necessarily used lower-quality feeding patches. Our results showed that male and female ibex, which are characterised by a strong dimorphism, adopted different strategies to solve the conflicting demands of foraging efficiently and avoiding predators."

This is the first study analysing nighttime behaviour by means of thermography. In total 640 partridges, clearly avoiding field boundaries as roosting sites to roost in the open field, were observed. Comparing day- and night-time behaviour of partridges they not only perceive a 'predation risk landscape' but moreover a 'predation risk schedule' resulting in a circadian shift in anti-predation strategies. Furthermore, partridges were ascertained to roost in tighter groupings on darker nights. I hypothesize that the efficiency of visual detection decreases with deteriorating light conditions - confirmed by a decreasing flight initiation distance - and partridges huddle closer together fearing such an insecure situation. The preference to roost in smaller subunits within one covey is explained by a more efficient predator detection compared to tight groupings. In contrast to the day- time behaviour, at night the first choice as an escape movement is flying. Altogether partridge behaviour in winter at night was found to be well adapted to predator avoidance and energy economy, explaining the lower predation rates during the 'covey season' compared to the spring phases of dispersal, laying and incubation."
"Kerr, GD; Bull, CM","Exclusive core areas in overlapping ranges of the sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,17,380,391,10.1093/beheco/arj041,2006,"Where animal home ranges overlap extensively, objectively identifying exclusive areas within individual ranges has been difficult, particularly in species lacking overt territorial behaviors. By analyzing the overlap between successively smaller core areas among individuals in a population of the long-lived Australian skink, the sleepy lizard (Tiliqua rugosa), we objectively determined exclusive areas within animal ranges. Using 4-year radio tracking data, we found that ranges consisted of relatively large sally zones (mean 66-80% total range), around home ranges with multinucleate cores strongly associated with key refuge sites. Total range and home range area varied significantly among years, being smaller in a drought year. Total ranges overlapped extensively between and within sexes, but for both sexes, intrasexual overlap of inner range cores rapidly approached zero, suggesting intrasexual territoriality. Intersexual inner core overlap reflected this species socially monogamous mating system. But, male overlap of female ranges and inner cores was consistently higher than female-male overlap. Refuges and/or mates may be defended resources within these core areas, although aggressive behavioral interactions were rarely observed. In the extensively overlapping sally zones, males shared space with females other than their principal partner. In productive years, with larger home ranges and more extensive overlap, some lizards associated with extra partners, suggesting that males opportunistically use sally zones for polygyny. Consequently, we suggest that benefits to females from male association may change with environmental quality, such that if food resources are low, monogamy may be favored if females increase foraging efficiency as a consequence of male vigilance during pairing."

Remotely sensed data provide an ever-increasing amount of environmental and climatic variables at high spatiotemporal resolutions, and a unique opportunity to produce fine-scale habitat models particularly useful in challenging environments, such as high-elevation areas. Working at a 10-m spatial resolution, we assessed the value of remotely sensed data for investigating foraging habitat selection (in relation to topography, microclimate, land cover) in nestling-rearing white-winged snowfinch (Montifringilla nivalis), a high-elevation species highly sensitive to climate change. Adult snowfinches foraged at locations with intermediate vegetation cover and higher habitat heterogeneity, also avoiding extremely warm or extremely cold microclimates. Temperature interacted with other environmental drivers in defining habitat selection, highlighting trade-offs between habitat profitability and thermoregulation: snowfinches likely adopted mechanisms of behavioural buffering against physiologically stressful conditions by selecting for cooler, shaded and more snowy foraging grounds at higher temperatures. Our results matched those from previous studies based on accurate field measurements, confirming the species' reliance on climate-sensitive microhabitats (snow patches and low-sward grassland, in heterogeneous patches) and the usefulness of satellite-derived fine-scale modelling. Habitat suitability models built on remotely sensed predictors can provide a cost-effective method for periodic monitoring of species' habitats both at fine grain and over large extents. Fine-scale models also enhance our understanding of the actual drivers of (micro)habitat selection and of possible buffering behaviours against warming, allowing more accurate and robust distribution models, finer predictions of potential future changes and carefully targeted conservation strategies and habitat management."

Little is known, however, about the extent to which barrier sprays containing insect growth regulators (IGR) such as pyriproxyfen affect immature mosquito development and life table characteristics. To learn more, we carried out a field study in a suburban Eastern North Carolina neighborhood from May 16-November 2, 2017. We evaluated the effect of Demand CS (pyrethroid adulticide with active ingredient lambda-cyhalothrin) and Archer (IGR with active ingredient pyriproxyfen) exposure with respect to reproduction (measured by fecundity, fertility, and adult emergence) and abundance of host-seeking mosquitoes Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae). These mosquitoes were collected using BG-Sentinel 2 traps; oviposition intensity was monitored using ovitraps for each property involved in the study. Eggs from ovitraps were reared in the laboratory to assess life table characteristics. Significantly more Ae. albopictus eggs (p < .05) were detected in ovitraps located in control lots, whereas no significant differences were observed in host-seeking adult abundance of Ae. albopictus between treatments. Potential reasons for this finding are discussed with respect to oviposition and host-seeking behavior of Ae. albopictus. Pyriproxyfen could be a useful control method for some populations of Ae. albopictus, especially where resistance to other active ingredients or cryptic oviposition sources are present."

Here we compare movement of juvenile and adult Cape fur seals at a high risk (Seal Island) and low risk (Egg Island) rookery. We further compare juveniles and adults at Seal Island in low and high risk seasons and at low and high risk times of day within those seasons. Adult fur seals at Seal Island avoided traversing the zone of high white shark predation risk during the high risk period (0700-0959) in the season of high risk (winter), but not during the low risk season (summer). By contrast, adult fur seals at Egg Island showed no temporal discretion in either season. Unlike juvenile fur seals at Egg Island, juveniles at Seal Island adjusted their temporal movement patterns to more closely mimic adult seal movement patterns. This suggests that exposure to predators is the primary driver of temporal adjustments to movement by prey species commuting from a central place."

Using Atlantic mollies (Poecilia mexicana) as a model-a species in which males do not court but almost constantly try to forcefully mate with females-we asked whether and how male harassment influences (a) females' time budgets and (b) feeding rates (e. g., through frequent flight from male approaches), and (c) whether metabolic rates are increased as a response to stress. Field observations in a natural P. mexicana population revealed that males (average feeding rate 15%) spent far less time feeding than females (60%), and clearly traded off frequent pursuit of females with foraging. Most importantly, females' feeding times were dramatically reduced when being pursued by a harassing male. Also in standardized lab experiments, females spent significantly less time feeding when accompanied by a male as compared to being in the presence of another female. This effect was also observed when partner fish (male or female) were presented only visually, but could not interact physically with the focal female. It seems, therefore, that females increase vigilance when a harassing male is around, which keeps them from feeding even before males actually approach them. Based on the latter result, we asked whether a stress-induced increase in metabolic rates would be discernible. We measured oxygen consumption and gill ventilation frequencies (opercular rates) of females in different social contexts (alone, with another female, or a male). The predicted, strong body mass dependency of both physiological parameters was uncovered, but no evidence for an effect of social context was detected. We argue that male harassment represents such a constant (but non-lethal) stressor for poeciliid females that their metabolic stress responses have adapted to this through habituation."

In this study, feeding stations were provided for black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) at 3 distances from perennial shrubs to test the prediction that the intensity of foraging by these hares would subside as they moved away from the presumed safety of shrub cover. Jackrabbits consumed significantly more food at stations under shrub canopies than at stations 5 and 10 m from shrubs. Thus, results are consistent with the hypothesis that risk of predation constrains the foraging activities of jackrabbits. The two-fold increase in food consumption near shrubs as compared with consumption away from shrubs implies that native plants or agronomic crops should incur lower levels of herbivory by jackrabbits when they occur at some distance from protective cover."

We used two populations occurring at sites of the Monte desert that differ in plant structure and availability, and in predation risk. At Nacunan plant cover is 54.3%, the major risk of predation is from raptors. At El Leoncito plant cover is 21.9%, the predation risk is similar by raptors and carnivores. In addition we investigated whether olfactory cues for different predators may elicit different antipredator responses in absence of visual cues. This was done by presenting feces of two predators and controls in an experimental set-up. The exposed individuals reduced their activity in response to feces of both predators and not in response to the control, but they did not respond in the same way to each predator (their response to each predator was not the same). The results show that M. australis recognizes different predators through both sight and smell, and that the response may be influenced by vegetation structure."

Behaviors were recorded applying a digital video camera to characterize diurnal activities. and from these all ethogram was constructed. Scan sampling and focal sampling were used to analyze the recorded behaviors. Four long behavioral states and seven short behavioral events were distinguished. During the diurnal period, most bats were inactive and were presumed to be sleeping, although at least one individual always remained active and alert. The fact that at least one bat was always alert during the day-roosting period suggests that some level of vigilance may be needed for bats to successfully occupy exposed roosts. although the bats were inactive more than 80% of the day-roosting period, this was an interrupted phenomenon since individuals did not sleep continuously for more than 20 min (on average) when they were observed sleeping. Differences between the single harem male and all associated female were significant in terms of the frequency of states and events, and duration of some behavioral states. The harem male was active (i.e. alert) 13%, of time of the diurnal period,whereas the female was active 1% of the time during this same period. Differences may be related to predation risks or actual and potential incursions of other males into the roost. The male allocated 4% of his time to grooming, whereas the female allocated 9% of her time to grooming, which may be related to the female's reproductive condition."

In several platyrrhine species, intersexual and intrasexual cooperation and tolerance in the form of dyadic and group-level social interactions are reported to serve a critical role in the ability of individuals to obtain access to mates, effectively patrol and defend home ranges and feeding sites, and increase offspring survivorship. Howler monkeys constitute an instructive model for testing hypotheses concerning the costs and benefits of collective action as they usually live in cohesive social groups composed largely of unrelated or distantly related adults. We explored evidence of collective action focusing on Argentina black and gold howlers (Alouatta caraya). We investigated the participation of individually recognized resident adult males in howling, vigilance, and fighting bouts during intergroup encounters, an event during which extragroup males (either lone males or males from neighboring groups) attempt to enter established groups and mate with resident females. During these encounters, some or all resident adult males responded by howling and approaching the intruder. Based on data on individual male participation during intergroup encounters, we argue that the collective action of several males benefits both actors and other group members by reducing opportunities for extragroup male takeovers, infanticide, and social disruption in established groups. Individuals may adjust their participation during these encounters in order to reduce the costs and enhance the benefits of collective action in maintaining reproductive access to resident females. We suggest that intergroup encounters are platforms where collective action problems may arise, are negotiated, and are solved through joint actions by central males and noncentral males. We also present limited data on male collective action in other howler monkey species."

However, the function of female signals in intrasexual competition has been little studied in species with conventional sex roles. In the Iberian populations of the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), some females express a white forehead patch, a trait that in other European populations, only males exhibit and has become a classical example in studies of sexual selection. Here, we investigated whether the expression of this trait plays a role in female-female competition during early breeding stages. To test this hypothesis, we simulated territorial intrusions by challenging resident females with stuffed female decoys expressing or not a forehead patch. We found that resident females directed more attacks per trial and maintained closer distances to non-patched decoys than to patched ones. Also, patched females were more likely to attack the decoy than non-patched females. Interestingly, females were more aggressive against the decoys when their mate was absent. This may indicate that females relax territory vigilance in the presence of their mate or that males interfere in the interaction between competing females. The behavior of resident males was also observed, although it was not affected by decoy's patch expression. Our findings suggest that the forehead patch plays a role in female intrasexual competition. If the forehead patch signals fighting ability, as it does in males, we may interpret that non-patched females probably avoided repeating costly agonistic encounters with the most dominant rivals."

Instead, it has been argued that offspring delay dispersal in response to poor dispersal opportunities and changes in the social environment as a consequence of dispersal decisions have been overlooked. To test whether parents provide their offspring with nepotistic antipredator protection, we conducted a field experiment to investigate predator mobbing in the Siberian jay. We used models of a mounted hawk and owl, which represent the two main predators as confirmed by recoveries of killed radiotagged individuals. Kin groups mobbed the predator models for longer and uttered both more calls in total and more predator-specific calls than nonkin groups. However, not all categories of individual called equally. In particular, alpha males gave most calls, especially in the presence of their retained offspring. Unrelated immigrants behaved least cautiously and approached the models closer and for longer than any other individual category. Furthermore, jays mobbed the hawk model, their most dangerous predator, for longer and took fewer risks than they did when mobbing the owl model. Our experiments show that effort and risk taking while mobbing in the Siberian jay not only depend on the danger posed by the predator, but are also influenced by the social environment. Parents invest more in the presence of their offspring. We suggested that such nepotistic antipredator behaviour gives offspring an incentive to delay dispersal and that nepotism could therefore have a pivotal role for the evolution of kin group living in animals."

Monitoring the PA of children and adolescents is crucial for ascertaining and understanding the phenomena that facilitate and hinder PA in order to develop effective interventions for promoting physically active habits. Popular individual-level measures are sensitive to social desirability bias and subject reactivity. Intrusiveness of these methods, especially when studying children, also limits the possible duration of monitoring and assumes strict submission to human research ethics requirements and vigilance in personal data protection. Meanwhile, growth in computational capacity has enabled computer vision researchers to successfully use deep learning algorithms for real-time behaviour analysis such as action recognition. This work analyzes the weaknesses of existing methods used in PA research; gives an overview of relevant advances in video-based action recognition methods; and proposes the outline of a novel action intensity classifier utilizing sensor-supervised learning for estimating ambient PA. The proposed method, if applied as a distributed privacy-preserving sensor system, is argued to be useful for monitoring the spatio-temporal distribution of PA in schools over long periods and assessing the efficiency of school-based PA interventions."

Ponds and four different habitat alternatives for lesser rheas were determined using satellite images and different structural vegetation characteristics: steppe, shrubland, shrub steppe, and mallines. Lesser rheas (adults, juveniles and chicks) used all habitats available to feed, although they showed preference for mallines, open areas that offer good visibility and abundant food resource. Rheas used shrub steppe and steppe for nesting, but they did not show preference for either habitat type. Nest site had a higher percentage of vegetation cover than control sites. Lesser rheas apparently preferred concealed sites for nesting since they offer protection from severe climate conditions and from predators. Our results suggest that habitat preference by lesser rheas counterbalances profitability of feeding to the corresponding cost of predation."
"Walther, Bruno A.",Do peacocks devote maintenance time to their ornamental plumage? Time budgets of male blue peafowl Pavo cristatus.,Lundiana,4,149,154,,2003,"Elaborate secondary sexual traits, such as the ornamental plumage of birds, appear to be favoured by female choice because they serve as honest advertisements of male quality. Elaborate plumage is thought to be an honest signal because it is energetically expensive to produce and to carry, and it may also increase the vulnerability of males to predators. According to several recent studies, the elaborate ornamental train of male blue peafowls (Pavo cristatus) appears to be such an honest signal. In this paper, I explore another potential cost of such plumage, which is the daily time and energy investment required to maintain the plumage in good condition. Since time devoted to maintenance cannot be devoted to feeding, vigilance, or other activities, the maintenance cost of ornamental plumage should reinforce the honesty of such plumage as an advertisement of male quality. I observed free-ranging peacocks for 30 hours at the Denver Zoo in June 2002 and April 2003. Preening, scratching and dusting took up more than 99% of maintenance time. Long bouts of maintenance behaviour were performed while peacocks were resting or standing, while short bouts occurred while peacocks were walking or feeding. No maintenance behaviours were observed while peacocks displayed their trains. Peacocks spent 14.9% of their total time budget on maintenance behaviours and 7.2% on displaying their trains, and 25.2% of their total grooming time on preening their trains. Consequently, peacocks not only incur the costs of producing and carrying their trains, but they also pay an additional maintenance cost. Hypotheses concerning the indicator mechanism of ornamental plumage need to consider these additional costs, as any additional cost should make the signal even more honest."
"Frid, A; Dill, L",Human-caused disturbance stimuli as a form of predation risk,CONSERVATION ECOLOGY,6,,,,2002,"A growing number of studies quantify the impact of nonlethal human disturbance on the behavior and reproductive success of animals. Athough many are well designed and analytically sophisticated, most lack a theoretical framework for making predictions and for understanding why particular responses occur. Behavioral ecologists have recently begun to fill this theoretical vacuum by applying economic models of antipredator behavior to disturbance studies. In this emerging paradigm, predation and nonlethal disturbance stimuli create similar trade-offs between avoiding perceived risk and other fitness-enhancing activities, such as feeding, parental care, or mating. A vast literature supports the hypothesis that antipredator behavior has a cost to other activities, and that this trade-off is optimized when investment in antipredator behavior tracks short-term changes in predation risk. Prey have evolved antipredator responses to generalized threatening stimuli, such as loud noises and rapidly approaching objects. Thus, when encountering disturbance stimuli ranging from the dramatic, low-flying helicopter to the quiet wildlife photographer, animal responses are likely to follow the same economic principles used by prey encountering predators. Some authors have argued that, similar to predation risk, disturbance stimuli can indirectly affect fitness and population dynamics via the energetic and lost opportunity costs of risk avoidance. We elaborate on this argument by discussing why, from an evolutionary perspective, disturbance stimuli should be analogous to predation risk. We then consider disturbance effects on the behavior of individuals-vigilance, fleeing, habitat selection, mating displays, and parental investment-as well as indirect effects on populations and communities. A wider application of predation risk theory to disturbance studies should increase the generality of predictions and make mitigation more effective without over-regulating human activities."

Nevertheless, little is known about how mammals discriminate between apparently similar foods of different quality. Here, we compared the foraging behavior of Chinese white-bellied rats, Niviventer confucianus, and Edwards's long-tailed giant rats, Leopoldamys edwardsi, under natural conditions in the field and in a captive enclosure without predation/competition. We examined the behavioral processes involved in discriminating between sound (i.e., undamaged) and insect larvae-infested nuts of seguin chestnuts (Castanea seguinii) and demonstrated that both rats could discriminate nut quality, where nut examination improved the rats' success rate at selecting sound nuts. Despite similar extents of discrimination-derived benefit in both settings for each species, differences between species-specific discrimination processes were identified. Chinese white-bellied rats engaged in a higher relative frequency and longer duration of nut examination in the enclosure than in the wild. This indicates that they alter their feeding strategy to trade-off selection for nut quality in captivity for a quantity-driven strategy in the field. In contrast, giant rats showed a consistent relative frequency of nut examination in both experimental settings. Their fixed strategy balanced food quality and quantity primarily to maximize caloric uptake without compromise when faced with predation or competition risk. We posit that this behavioral difference in optimal foraging between rat species is mediated by their differing, size-dependent energetic requirements as well as the higher competition pressure and predation risk faced by the approximately 8 times smaller white-bellied rats."
"Clement, Romain J. G.; Wolf, Max; Snijders, Lysanne; Krause, Jens; Kurvers, Ralf H. J. M.",Information transmission via movement behaviour improves decision accuracy in human groups,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,105,85,93,10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.04.004,2015,"A major advantage of group living is increased decision accuracy. In animal groups information is often transmitted via movement. For example, an individual quickly moving away from its group may indicate approaching predators. However, individuals also make mistakes which can initiate information cascades. How responsive should individuals then be to escaping group members? Increasing responsiveness increases true positives (i.e. escape when a predator is present) but at the cost of increased false positives (i.e. escape when a predator is absent). Conversely, reducing responsiveness decreases not only false positives but also true positives, resulting in a fundamental trade-off in decision accuracy. Here we investigated how socially responsive individuals are to information transmission via movement. We performed a simulated predator detection task using human groups in which humans stepped forward if they wanted to escape. We confirm that this simple movement mechanism allows individuals in groups to simultaneously increase true positives and decrease false positives. The increase in the number of escapees over time during collective decisions depended on the personal information of the group members. Individual predator detection by only a few group members rarely resulted in anyone stepping forward. Individual predator detection by a quarter of the group often resulted in the entire group escaping. Finally, individual predator detection by at least half of the group led to a rapid escape of the whole group. Overall, the increase in the number of escapees over time followed a linear response.

All these traits can be involved in the ontogeny of behavioral phenotypes, and therefore, we wanted to know whether features such as early growth also show long-term correlations with the animals' behavioral responses to challenges around maturity. We collected data on the early postnatal development of individually marked European rabbits living in a field enclosure and conducted 2 standardized behavioral tests shortly before the animals matured. In small enclosures, we experimentally tested their behavioral responses 1) in this novel environment and 2) to the confrontation with predator odor. Animals, which were more exploratory during the novel environment test, showed lower behavioral signs of anxiety during the predator test. Both responses were correlated with individual pup body mass, with subjects with higher body mass being more exploratory in the first test and showing lower levels of anxiety in the second. The animals' current body mass or age when being tested were not correlated with any of their responses. First, the correlated responses of the animals during the different contexts of the applied tests strongly suggest the existence of behavioral phenotypes in European rabbits. Second, and most importantly, our study provides evidence that an animal's early development can exert long-term effects on its personality type, although it is not clear whether body mass per se or some correlated physiological features drive the observed relationships."

On Luroya 38 pairs attempted to nest, and in the whole study area 98 pairs. Estimated median data of laying of first egg was 10 June, and median hatching date 7 July. Mean clutch size in the middle of the incubation period was 4.0 eggs. On Luroya nesting success was 25.7%, hatching success 28.6%, and hatching success for the whole study area was c. 24%. Most losses were attributed to predation (62% of all eggs), polar bears being the most severe predators. Until mid July the islands were surrounded by drift ice, and bears occurred regularly. Bears not only damaged nests but also created disturbance in the nesting colony, offering Arctic Skuas opportunity to take eggs from deserted nests. Other losses were due to female nest desertion during late incubation. Post-hatching losses were negligible. 17 pairs of Barnacle Geese nested on an island adjacent to Luroya, and pairs were nest prospecting on Luroya, but were effectively expelled by territorial Brent males. During nesting, territorial Brent males spent most of the time in vigilance, followed by grazing and resting. Intruding avian predators and other geese were vigorously chased out of the territories. On average females were attentive to their nests 91% of the time. The rest of the time was spent foraging and preening in the territory. During nesting, time off the nest increased. Food resources on the islands were poor. Moss constituted the staple part of the diet during nesting and post-hatching, but the geese selected Cochlearia and Saxifraga. In wet moss carpets where most foraging took place, Cochlearia was almost completely depleted. The high predation pressure observed may be the prime factor responsible for the general low reproductive output of the population, as observed in the Danish wintering quarters. It seems that the Barnacle Goose population on Tusenoyane is expanding, and interspecific competition for nest sites and food may arise."
"Halliday, William D.; Morris, Douglas W.",Safety from predators or competitors? Interference competition leads to apparent predation risk,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,94,1380,1392,10.1644/12-MAMM-A-304.1,2013,"Prey often react to predation risk by foraging preferentially in the safety of cover rather than in more risky open patches. Yet this pattern of patch use also can be caused by dominant interspecific competitors. We develop a simple theory of this form of apparent predation risk that describes the patch use of an optimal forager confronted with dominant individuals. The theory predicts that subordinate animals should increase their use of safe foraging patches as the density of nearby dominants increases. We tested the theory with meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). We used dyadic encounters to confirm that meadow voles are dominant over red-backed voles. We then evaluated their respective foraging patterns in pairs of covered and open patches in 4 adjacent subgrids in an old-field enclosure. Subordinate red-backed voles foraged indifferently between covered and open patches when few meadow voles were present. Red-backed voles increased their use of both patches as the number of nearby meadow voles increased. Giving-up densities were lowest, and harvesting efficiency highest, in covered patches when the number of nearby meadow voles was high. These results document competition between the 2 species and suggest that vigilance toward dominant meadow voles magnifies the risk experienced by red-backed voles in open patches. Investigators assessing foraging behavior between safe and risky patches might misinterpret the competitive effect as predation risk unless they 1st account for competition among foraging individuals."

We quantified responses of brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater (Boddaert), and mourning doves, Zenaida macroura (Linnaeus), to object approach (a ground-based vehicle) and vehicle lighting regimen, and we examined two visual properties (visual acuity and visual fields) that could influence antipredator behaviour. Brown-headed cowbird groups exposed to vehicle approach and constant illumination of the vehicle-mounted lamp showed alert behaviour earlier than did groups exposed to pulsating treatments or no lamp. Interestingly, light treatments interacted with ambient light; cowbird alert response occurred sooner under sunny conditions and constant illumination of the lamp. Mourning doves were not affected by light treatments. Between species, mourning dove groups had a quicker alert response (and slower flight response) than brown-headed cowbirds. Visual acuity was higher and the visual field was wider in mourning doves than in brown-headed cowbirds. We speculate that brown-headed cowbirds might flush sooner to reduce predation risk costs associated with a relatively lower ability to visually track a given object. Our findings have theoretical and applied implications, as our model species belong to families that show different antipredator responses, and provide insight as to how object lighting might be used to reduce bird-structure/vehicle collisions, an increasing source of mortality in birds.

Incorporating measures of animal behavior into evaluations of restoration success will provide critical information that is not available from animal species composition and richness estimates derived from the documentation of species presence and absence. Behavioral studies will (1) allow comparisons of the habitat quality of target and reference sites based on behaviors that have fitness consequences for organisms; (2) provide valuable information about reasons for differences in habitat quality; (3) identify critical resources that make a site suitable or not for particular species; and/or (4) provide information on the mechanisms through which species contribute to ecosystem functions. When resources for the evaluation of restoration success are available, practitioners should carefully consider the costs and benefits of the different variables they could quantify. In some cases, it may be more important to compare the behavior of one or a few critical animal species that contribute to ecosystem function rather than try to document the presence or absence of all species."

The effects of population density, male density, and operational sex ratio on time budgets were analyzed. Although no differences were apparent before the rut, populations differed in the time budgets of females and yearling males during the rut. During this period, the time spent by females in feeding and resting activities of yearling males decreased with increasing population density, whereas feeding and resting activities of yearling males decreased with increasing male density. Behaviour of adult males during the rut and interactions of adult males with other animals appeared to be the principal factors affecting the time budgets of both females and yearling males. Our results show that density-dependent effects may occur through social interactions alone, regardless of the effects on resource depletion. The decrease in the proportion of time spent in restoring (lying and grazing) behaviours represents an energy cost for both females and young males. Given the timing of the rut just before the winter, this cost may negatively effect the condition of individuals."
"Koivula, K; Rytkonen, S; Orell, M",Hunger-dependency of hiding behaviour after a predator attack in dominant and subordinate Willow Tits,ARDEA,83,397,404,,1995,"We studied rank-specificity of predation risk taking in captive Willow Tits Parus montanus. Level of risk taking was expressed by duration of hiding after a simulated predator attack. By manipulating available food, we separated the effects of hunger and other rank associated factors on accepted predation risk. As expected, hungry birds took more risks than satiated ones. When both the dominants and the subordinates were hungry or satiated, no rank-related differences existed in the duration of hiding. When the dominants had consumed more food than the subordinates, they also hid longer. Similarly, the subordinates hid longer when they were satiated and dominants hungry. We conclude that incautiousness of subordinates, reported earlier with regard to variety of antipredatory behaviours of flocking birds, probably reflects a strategy to cope with high risk of starvation resulting from restricted access to food."

The proportion of food eaten before the arrival of conspecifics, the finder's share, is hypothesized to play a major role in shaping group geometry, foraging strategy, and feeding competition. The variables that affect the finder's share in ring-tailed coatis were tested using a series of food trials. The number of grapes in the food trials had a strong negative effect on the finder's share and the probability that the finder was joined. The effect of group size on the finder's share and foraging success was not straightforward and was mediated by sociospatial factors. The finder's share increased when the time to arrival of the next individual was longer, the group was more spread out, and the finder was in the back of the group. Similarly, the total amount of food eaten at a trial was higher when more grapes were placed, arrival time was longer, and the number of joiners was smaller. Individuals at the front edge of the group found far more food trials, but foraging success was higher at the back of the group where there were fewer conspecifics to join them. This study highlights the importance of social spacing strategies and group geometry on animal foraging tactics and the costs and benefits of sociality."

These vocalizations are produced in different contexts, including territorial defence and parenteoffspring interactions. They are also produced in response to predators, but we know less about whether animals, especially birds, are able to discriminate among individuals based on antipredator calls. We therefore examined whether an avian species (peafowl, Pavo cristatus) is able to differentiate between the antipredator calls of different individuals. Using a habituation-discrimination playback paradigm, we habituated peahens to the antipredator calls of a given individual and then examined their responses to additional calls from that individual and to calls from a novel individual. We found that peahens responded more strongly to calls from the novel individual than from the original individual, demonstrating that they are able to differentiate between individuals based on the acoustic properties of antipredator calls. The ability to differentiate between individual callers may be useful to peahens in modifying their antipredator behaviour based on signaller reliability.

In landscapes dominated by human activities, wildlife can respond to human disturbance in a similar fashion to the risk of predation. Further, the risk allocation hypothesis suggests that individuals respond most strongly to risk when it is spatially and temporally predictable. We predict that individuals in agriculturally dominated landscapes will respond to potential risk from humans during hunting season by shifting their behavior to avoid agricultural areas during the day, instead retreating to refuge habitat. We predict that this shift to more nocturnal behavior will be strongest for elk (Cervus elaphus) adult female-calf pairs and will be influenced by the level of moon illumination. Using motion-sensing cameras, we studied the response of elk moving between the Wainwright Dunes Ecological Reserve (a hunting refuge) and surrounding agriculturally dominated landscape in east-central Alberta, Canada, to human disturbance in relation to sunrise and sunset. Elk became increasingly nocturnal with the onset of hunting, leaving the refuge following sunset and returning to the refuge earlier before sunrise. Further, elk became increasingly nocturnal in response to greater levels of moon illumination. Lastly, we found that adult female-calf pairs perceived greater risks associated with diurnal activity and exhibited the most nocturnal behavior relative to other demographic classes. Our results suggest that ungulate management based on traditional hunting seasons and times may be problematic as it creates strong cues for resident elk, allowing them to minimize risk by avoiding risky places at risky times in accordance with the risk allocation hypothesis.

Little is known about how these positions differ between competitors. We tackled this issue in the triplefin fish Enneapterygius etheostoma, which spawns in turbulent flow environments, and which employs external fertilization and alternative reproductive tactics (i.e. sneakers and territorial males). A frame-by-frame analysis of video images of sneaking behaviours recorded in the wild revealed that sneakers ejaculated later, and further from the spawning female, than territorial males. The majority of sneaking attempts failed because of attacks by territorial males. Successful sneakers mostly hid behind shelters around the spawning sites and then rushed into the site (i.e. were undetected), or were detected and attacked as they approached the site or hid near it, but rushed in anyway (attack-initiated sneaking). Of the undetected successful sneakers, a minority rushed in when the spawning female was being ignored by a territorial male that was attacking other sneakers (induced sneaking) and the others rushed in when there was no territorial attack (attack-free sneaking). Attack-free sneaking was carried out by sneakers that hid closer to the spawning female for longer, and were spatially and temporally closer to territorial males at ejaculation. Altogether, we conclude that the abilities to get past territorial vigilance and observe gamete release of spawning pairs at a hiding place are key factors that helped sneakers to improve their position at ejaculation, and thus perhaps their fertilization success.

Locations of 53 adult female pronghorn (Antilocapm americana) in Yellowstone National Park during June 1999 April 2005 indicated that mean and typical group sizes and the variation in group size decreased during fawning when females secluded themselves, but became larger and more dynamic during fawn rearing and the rut and winter. Mixed-effects models indicated a strong effect of time of year on mean group sizes, with some evidence that predators negatively affected group sizes during winter. Within-animal variability (0.64) was substantially higher than between-animal variability (0.02). Pronghorn density, snow water equivalent, and predation apparently influenced variations in group size. Multiple regressions indicated effects of pronghorn density and snow water equivalent on typical group size, the size of the group in which the average animal finds itself. Overall, there was fluidity in group cohesion, with female associations changing within and among days. The behavioral plasticity of pronghorn with respect to grouping and social cohesion might confer resilience to changes in environmental conditions, but often makes it difficult to predict the consequences of conservation actions to control disease, protect or restore key habitat, regulate harvests, and limit adverse effects of development and recreation."

However, the variation of defense behavior among members and its reproductive consequences are largely unknown. We investigated (1) individual variation in the nest defense of breeding Black-tailed Gulls Larus crassirostris against a natural egg predator, the Jungle Crow Corvus macrorhynchos and (2) how this behavioral variation affects an individual's own nest predation risk and that of their neighbors. Results were compared between 2 years where crow attack levels were manipulated to average 5 and 22 times normal rates (low and high predation risk years, respectively) by the placement of varying numbers of artificial nests containing unguarded eggs at the perimeter of the gull colony. In both years, 23-38% of parents, mostly males, showed aggressive defense behavior (strikes or chases) against crows and decoys. Other non-aggressive gulls showed no defense. In the year of low predation risk, intrusion rates by crows (landing within 0.5 m of an individual gull's nest) were similar for aggressive and non-aggressive gulls. In the year of high predation risk, however, the rates of intrusion for aggressive gulls (4%) and for non-aggressive gulls with an aggressive neighbor (37%) were significantly lower than for non-aggressive gulls without an aggressive neighbor (76%). These results indicate that aggressive individuals reduce nest predation risk for themselves and conspecific neighbors in a colonially breeding species."

We believe that an explicit description of this vulnerability will provide many insights into both the function and architecture (or organization) of sleep. Early studies of sleep recognized this idea, but it has been largely overlooked during the last 20 years. We critically evaluate early models that suggested that the function of sleep is antipredator in nature, and outline a new model in which we argue that whole-brain or 'blackout' sleep may be the safest way to sleep given a functionally interconnected brain. Early comparative work also suggested that the predatory environment is an important determinant of sleep architecture. For example, species that sleep in risky environments spend less time in the relatively vulnerable states of sleep. Recent experimental work suggests that mammals and birds shift to relatively vigilant (lighter) states of sleep in response to an increase in perceived risk; these results mirror the influence of stress on sleep in humans and rats. We also outline a conceptual model of sleep architecture in which dynamic changes in sleep states reflect a trade-off between the benefits of reducing a sleep debt and the cost of predation. Overall, many aspects of plasticity in sleep related to predation risk require further study, as do the ways in which sleeping animals monitor predatory threats. More work outside of the dominant mammalian paradigm in sleep is also needed. An ecologically based view of sleeping under the risk of predation will provide an important complement to the traditional physiological and neurological approaches to studying sleep and its functions. 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We tested this hypothesis by examining relationships between group size, survival, and reproduction in African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), cooperative hunters with highly cohesive packs within which reproduction is monopolized by the dominant male and female. The production and survival of pups are known to increase with increasing pack size, but the effect of pack size on adult survival has not been examined previously. Data from 366 individuals over a period of 6 years showed that the survival of adults decreased with increasing pack size, with a 25% difference between the largest and smallest packs after controlling for the effects of age, sex, social status, year of study, and pack identity. Several tests confirmed that undetected dispersal is unlikely to have produced this pattern. These results suggest that cooperative breeding in wild dogs cannot be fully explained by mutual direct benefit, thus reinforcing the prior inference that kin selection plays an important role in the evolution of their cooperation. The results also weaken support for the hypothesis that wild dogs are extinction prone due to group-level Allee effects. More broadly, the relationship of effects of group size on survival and reproduction might be predicted by considering whether cooperation yields benefits that accrue to all group members (e.g., through cooperative vigilance) or benefits that must be apportioned to individuals (e.g., through cooperative hunting)."

While the influence of space use on association patterns is increasingly being considered in studies using network analysis, methods are needed for generating null models that control for pairwise home range overlap. We investigated female associations in a wild population of eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, a species with higher fission-fusion dynamics, to test the influences of home range overlap and kinship on pairwise association strengths. Genetic analysis revealed that females were highly philopatric and we found that association strengths were significantly correlated with home range overlap. To test for social preferences, we compared observed associations with random associations based on individuals' space use, simulated using Digiroo2. HWIG, a version of the half-weight association index that controls for among-individual variation in gregariousness was used for all analyses. Preferred associates had significantly higher pairwise relatedness than expected. Although some females had strong social relationships with some of their close kin, in general, space use had a much stronger correlation with association strengths than both pairwise relatedness and maternal lineage. This suggests that familiarity may play a key role in driving association patterns in female kangaroos. We recommend controlling for individuals' space use when undertaking studies on social preferences and social structure in general. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Few studies, however, have examined interspecific variation in dependence on and ability to evaluate alarm signals in mixed-species groups. We conducted a playback experiment to evaluate how species in different foraging guilds varied in their response to alarm calls of birds that lead Amazonian mixed-species flocks in both upland and inundated forests. We predicted that species that search nearby substrates myopically would react more strongly to alarm calls (i.e., take longer to resume foraging) than flycatching species that search for insects at a greater distance from a perch. We used likelihood functions to model the latency response to resume foraging for both upland and inundated forests samples, and we were able to detect significant differences among different foraging guilds. Our results indicate that flycatching birds respond weakest in both forest types, but contrary to our predictions, live-leaf gleaners showed a stronger response to alarms than dead-leaf-gleaning insectivores in inundated forest and no difference in upland forest. These results suggest that foraging guild may underlie different levels of dependence on public versus private information and, thus, the dependence of different species on heterospecific informants. These different levels of dependence on alarm calls provide a potential mechanistic basis for understanding assembly rules of flocks."

Here, we tested the effects of predator models and the distance of those models on calls of three species foraging together at feeding stations: Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) and tufted titmice (Baeolophus bicolor), both members of the Paridae family, and white-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis), a member of the Sittidae family. Model and distance affected seed-taking rates in all three species. Chick-a-dee calling rates were higher in the predator context for both chickadees and titmice, but we detected no predator context effects on quank call rates for nuthatches. Predator and distance contexts affected acoustic parameters of notes of the chick-a-dee calls of chickadees and titmice; no such effects were detected for nuthatch quank calls. These results suggest species differences in encoding of information in the primary social calls of these three species that commonly occur in multi-species flocks. Chickadees and titmice are nuclear species and nuthatches are satellite species, and these different roles might be related to the differences in vocal signaling that we detected."

The role of fringing vegetation in facilitating surface water access by arid zone bird communities was investigated over a 14-month period during which water demand increased. Bird visitation to six long-lasting waterholes in the MacDonnell Ranges Bioregion in central Australia was recorded over two summers and one winter using camera traps. Species were assigned to functional classes based on their size and preferred foraging substrate. Generalised linear mixed models were used to test relationships between fringing vegetation variables and the independent trapping events for each functional class. Fringing vegetation was critical for small and intermediate-sized canopy foragers to access waterhole sites. Their activity declined to almost zero in areas where the nearest tree or shrub cover was greater than 10 m. The strength of this relationship was consistent as weather conditions became drier and hotter. However, activity of small and intermediate-sized canopy foragers was negatively related to the percent canopy cover of the nearest tree or shrub, potentially because sparse vegetative cover offers greater visibility when approaching the water's edge. In contrast, ground forager and raptor activity at waterhole sites was unrelated to surrounding vegetation, and these groups frequently accessed water from open areas. Under future warming scenarios, small and intermediate canopy foragers may be vulnerable to predation if they are forced to access water at sites away from nearby fringing vegetation."
"Monus, Ferenc; Barta, Zoltan",Is Foraging Time Limited During Winter? - A Feeding Experiment with Tree Sparrows Under Different Predation Risk,ETHOLOGY,122,20,29,10.1111/eth.12439,2016,"Small passerines are faced with a trade-off when foraging during winter. Increasing energy reserves makes them more vulnerable to predators, while a low level of reserves exposes them to a high risk of starvation. Whether small birds under these circumstances are allowed to reduce their foraging activity under increased predation risk, for example in feeding sites more exposed to predators, remains controversial in former behavioural and ecological researches. In this study, we investigated the foraging activity of free-living Tree Sparrow Passer montanus flocks feeding on an artificial feeding platform. The predation risk perceived by the sparrows was manipulated by placing the platform either close to or far from a bushy shelter. Foraging activity, assessed as cumulative activity of sparrows per unit time on the platform, did not differ between the low-risk and the high-risk conditions and did not significantly change during the day. Feeding efficiency, assessed as pecking rate, was not either reduced under the high-risk condition. Our results suggest that sparrows were forced to feed almost continuously during the day in order to maintain their preferred level of energy reserves. However, several behavioural changes helped sparrows to adopt a safer foraging policy when feeding far from cover, as we found in another study. Altogether, sparrow flocks feeding far from cover decreased the overall foraging time (the time when any sparrow stayed on the platform) by approximately 20% as compared to the near cover condition. A possible way to maintain the same level of foraging activity despite of the reduction in overall foraging time is discussed."

They were all held in nocturnal display facilities, known in New Zealand as Kiwi Houses and referred to here as enclosures 1-4. Our detailed study first compiled a baseline assessment of normal behaviours of captive kiwi from which to define the abnormal. We found that abnormal behaviours (pacing and startle responses) were usually stimulated by one of three different sources of disturbance: noise generated by visitors viewing the kiwi through glass-viewing windows, noise resulting from heavy rainfall, and keeper interactions. As noise was a major contribution to disturbance, we quantified the volume of sound that reached the interior of the kiwi display spaces within each enclosure, and correlated it with kiwi behaviour. Our results show how abnormal behaviours among captive kiwi can be minimised by eliminating or reducing disturbances, and we suggest how the design and structure of the enclosures can be improved in the future by mitigating noise disturbance, (1) from visitors by installation of double or triple glazed window joinery, and (2) from outside by greater insulation in the roof and walls."
"Teichroeb, Julie A.; White, Maxine M. J.; Chapman, Colin A.",Vervet (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) Intragroup Spatial Positioning: Dominants Trade-Off Predation Risk for Increased Food Acquisition,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,36,154,176,10.1007/s10764-015-9818-4,2015,"The costs and benefits of group-living are not distributed evenly among group members. Individuals that maintain positions on the front, outside edge of the group encounter most predators first, but are more likely to access food patches before others. Therefore a trade-off exists in which a strategy maximizing safety, by staying in the group's center, may lower foraging success, whereas a strategy maximizing food acquisition may increase predation risk. We examined intragroup spatial positions for vervets (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda relative to sex, age, dominance rank, and activity when the group was moving and when it was stationary. We used artificial food patches of varied richness to examine which individuals found new food sources and what share they obtained. When the group was stationary, high-ranking females tended to be at the group's center, while males and subordinates were at the group's edge. Moving and feeding occurred more than expected at the edge, while social behavior took place in the center. When the group was moving, most females stayed in the center of the group, but dominant males and the alpha female foraged at the front, outside edge of the group. These dominants also found more artificial food patches and foraged at greater interindividual distances than those in the center. Whether they found patches or scrounged at the patches found by others, high-ranking individuals obtained more food than subordinates, but their overall share was greatest when they acted as producers rather than scroungers. This likely explains why dominant individuals traded off predation risk for food acquisition by consistently foraging on the front, outside edge of the group farther from conspecifics."

Although most of the members have been extensively studied, the reproductive biology of C. melanocotyphus, has not been described yet. In this study, we evaluate the starting and extension of the breeding season and clutch size number, using data collected at Carlos Anwandter Santuary (CAS), Valdivia, Chile, corresponding to 18 reproductive seasons. We also studied male and female behavior during incubation period. We monitored time budget and the distance relative to the nest of 6 breeding pairs, during one reproductive season. Nesting period can extend from June to January and is influenced by the population number and weather conditions. Clutch size is constant across seasons with a mode of three eggs (mean of 3.13 +/- 0.017 eggs; n = 5897). Both pair members cooperate in duties, such as vigilance and nest maintenance; however, incubation is an exclusive activity of females while the active defense of the nest is performed by males. Therefore, we propose that both extension of breeding season and number of breeding pairs are associated with density-dependent processes while clutch size seems to be highly conservative. Finally, we observed a clear separation in parental tasks for each sex during incubation period. Accepted 14 February 2013."

Although sex-biased helping is often assumed to be correlated with sex-specific benefits, sex-specific costs could also be responsible for sex-biased helping. Cooperatively breeding brown jays (Cyanocorax morio) in Monteverde, Costa Rica have helpers of both sexes and dispersal is male-biased, a rare reversal of the female-biased dispersal pattern often seen in birds. We quantified helper contributions to nestling care and analyzed whether there was sex-biased helping and if so, whether it was correlated with known benefits derived via helping. Brown jay helpers provided over 70% of all nestling feedings, but they did not appear to decrease the workload of breeders across the range of observed group sizes. Female helpers fed nestlings and engaged in vigilance at significantly higher levels than male helpers. Nonetheless, female helpers did not appear to gain direct benefits, either through current reproduction or group augmentation, or indirect fitness benefits from helping during the nestling stage. While it is possible that females could be accruing subtle future direct benefits such as breeding experience or alliance formation from helping, future studies should focus on whether the observed sex bias in helping is because males decrease their care relative to females in order to pursue extra-territorial forays. Explanations for sex-biased helping in cooperative breeders are proving to be as varied as those proposed for helping behavior in general, suggesting that it will often be necessary to quantify a wide range of benefits and costs when seeking explanations for sex-biased helping."

A preliminary study,AUSTRALIAN MAMMALOGY,44,98,108,10.1071/AM20061,2022,"The high extinction risk of Australian marsupials has been attributed to their failure to recognise novel predators, the application of inappropriate antipredator responses, and advanced hunting strategies of novel predators. This study is a preliminary attempt to explore whether the Lumholtz' tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) (a) is able to recognise odour cues from different predators as threats, and (b) possesses predator-archetype specific antipredator responses. A small number of available captive tree-kangaroos were exposed to faecal odours from two extant predators of different archetypes (python, dingo), a regionally extinct predator which closely matches past terrestrial predators (Tasmanian devil), and a novel predator (domestic dog). Lavender oil was used as non-predator novel odour and water as control. Results suggest that all subjects associated the presented odours with a threat, albeit to different degrees, but did not display predator-archetype specific responses. It appears that this species applies an ancestral antipredator response of flight-on-the ground when encountering predators, including novel predators. Although the results need to be confirmed with more animals, further studies on the vulnerability of Australian prey to novel predators should take the ancestral history of Australian prey species into account."

Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan capable of infecting all warm-blooded animals, including humans, primarily through a free-living oocyst and/or tissue cyst life stage. Anthropogenic disturbance is facilitating the spread of T. gondii, making it crucial to understand the general ecological and life-history drivers of T. gondii infections in wild birds, which are important intermediate hosts. Our goal was to determine how habitat (terrestrial versus aquatic), dietary trophic level and scavenging behaviour influence the prevalence of T. gondii infection in wild birds at a global scale.Location Global.Time period 1952-2017.Major taxa studied Birds.Methods Our analysis used the serological, bioassay and molecular prevalence data of T. gondii in avian species compiled from 81 studies conducted worldwide and encompassing 24,344 individuals from 393 avian species from 84 families.Results We showed that at a global scale, trophic level and habitat interacted significantly to influence T. gondii prevalence in avian intermediate hosts. In the terrestrial environment, T. gondii prevalence increased with trophic level, consistent with predominant tissue cyst transmission. The highest prevalence was in terrestrial omnivores, which might reflect their synanthropic foraging behaviour. In aquatic species, prevalence was more consistent across trophic levels, but high prevalence in aquatic herbivores and insectivores reflects significant waterborne exposure to oocysts. Contrary to our predictions, generalized scavenging per se was not associated with increased prevalence.Main conclusions This study highlights the value of comparing pathogen prevalence among multiple ecological guilds and ecosystem types for a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of generalist pathogens, such as T. gondii. Increased effort is needed to reduce T. gondii spillover from the domestic cat cycle into wildlife populations."

We first assessed differential treatment towards kin during paired encounters in an experimental arena (experiment 1). In addition, we used the habituation technique to investigate odour kin discrimination (experiment 2). In both experiments the relative influence of familiarity and phenotypic similarity were assessed using familiar and unfamiliar siblings, half siblings and genetically unrelated individuals. The results showed that O. degus treat conspecifics differentially as a function of familiarity; young reared apart were equally likely to explore each other independently of genetic relatedness. However, the exploratory behaviour of siblings reared apart and siblings reared together did not differ (experiment 1). On the other hand, degus did discriminate between odours of siblings, half siblings and unrelated individuals reared apart, and between odours of unrelated individuals reared together. Subjects did not discriminate between scents of their siblings reared together with them (experiment 2). These results suggest that familiarity is important in the interaction between animals and in the discrimination of conspeci. c scents. Nevertheless, our results suggest that phenotypic similarity may also influence social interactions and scent discrimination, although only between close kin, hence possibly influencing communal nesting. We propose that no single mechanism exclusively explains kin discrimination in degus. The prior association recognition mechanism mediated most instances of kin recognition, but phenotype matching is also used in close kin discrimination.

To examine this relationship, a human observer approached groups of Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), varying his behavior to simulate more or less threatening behavior. We measured the focal deer's angle of escape, distance moved during flight, duration of trotting and stotting behavior, and change in elevation during flight. Analyses revealed positive relationships between the distance moved during flight and the distance at which they fled. When flight was initiated when the approacher was close, deer fled relatively shorter distances and took flight paths at more acute angles, a property that would force a real predator to change direction suddenly. Our results indicate that deer do not compensate for allowing the observer to approach more closely by fleeing greater distances. Rather, distance moved and flight initiation distance are linked by level of reactivity and habituation: more reactive or less habituated deer both flee at a greater distance and move away to a greater distance during flight. More threatening behavior by the approacher led to longer durations of rapid flight behavior (e.g., trotting and stotting), and deer tended to flee uphill and into taller vegetation, using these landscape features as refuge from danger. Finally, we provide the first evidence for Pitcher's untested antiambush hypothesis for the function of stotting and discuss its significance. In general, both preflight predator behavior and habitat features influence both duration and direction of escape."

Most existing studies on mate retention are based on self-reports, which are prone to various biases. In this study, we observed non-verbal behaviour of 47 long-term romantic heterosexual couples during their interview with a female experimenter, whom the women in the couples may have perceived as a potential rival. We measured non-verbal displays of mate retention tactics (direct guarding, intimacy inducement, appearance enhancement, and love and care display), as well as relationship maintenance strategies of openness and positivity. We expected that relationship quality as reported by both partners in the couple would be positively associated with 'benefit-provisioning' mate retention behaviours and negatively associated with a 'cost-inflicting' mate retention tactic (direct guarding). Relationship quality was assessed by Spanier's Dyadic Adjustment Scale using both the total score of dyadic adjustment and a Dyadic Satisfaction subscale. We found a significant association between both partners' dyadic adjustment and satisfaction and woman's appearance enhancement behaviours (such as self-touch, hair flip and primp) in the presence of her partner and a potential rival. We also found a negative association between partner's dyadic adjustment and woman's direct guarding of partner using short looks, and a positive association between woman's intimacy-inducing behaviour using long gaze and her own dyadic satisfaction and her partner's dyadic adjustment. Our results highlight the specific role of female attractiveness in later stages of romantic relationships within the context of mate retention and draw attention to the significance of the use of observational techniques in addition to self-reports."

Male Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) are well known for their antipredator alarm calls that contain information about the approach of potential nest predators. We examined the begging behavior of nestlings and the provisioning behavior of females in response to antipredator alarm calls of males to test the adaptive response hypothesis. Playback experiments provided no evidence that alarm calls function to switch off vocal begging; nestlings were equally likely to beg vocally during playback and control periods. Video recordings showed that male alarm calling had no significant effect on inappropriate vocal begging (in the absence of an adult), but significantly reduced the incidence of spontaneous calling (in the absence of begging). Adult females responded to male antipredator alarm calls by delaying their provisioning visits. In addition, although having no significant effect on use of nest-arriving calls by females, male alarm calling significantly reduced their use of nest-leaving calls. We conclude that nestling and female Red-winged Blackbirds respond to male alarm calls in ways that might reduce the risk of predation, but nestlings beg vocally when females arrive to feed them, regardless of male alarm calling, perhaps to avoid a competitive disadvantage with broodmates."

We overcame these issues by casting the process of investigating behavioural interactions into a network inference methodology. We summarized multivariate time series using a complex network whose construction depends on a surrogate hypothesis testing data analysis of synchronous interactions between animals. The method accounts for the effect of third parties on pairwise comparisons, allows one to test the effect of the size of the sampling window on the interactions between animals, and allows one to test behavioural models of increasing complexity. We used a continuous 1-month behavioural data set of the foraging activity of a mixed-sex group of 40 Soay sheep, Ovis aries. We uncovered underlying patterns of behavioural interaction between individual sheep by applying our inferential approach to the symbolic multivariate time series of activity, that is grazing, not grazing. Our findings clearly indicate that animals of the same sex are more synchronized than animals of different sex independent of body size. We advocate that the method proposed is more general and more efficient at detecting patterns of synchronization than traditional concordance indices. We provide the reader with a comprehensive software toolbox to apply the methodology proposed. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We tested the behavioural responses of eastern quolls (Dasyurus viverrinus) to acoustic cues of native (masked owl (Tyto novaehollandiae castanops) and Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus laniarius)) and non-native (fox and cat) predators and to non-predators (cow (Bos taurus) and control noise). Juvenile quolls treated fox vocalisations like those of cows (as measured by an increase in movement), in contrast to their responses (a decrease in movement) to sympatric predators. Cats are probably a lesser threat to eastern quolls than native predators or foxes, their impact probably being greatest on the juveniles. Juvenile quolls, but not adults, showed similar responses to cat vocalisations as they did to owls and devils. Adult quolls responded differently from juveniles to owls and devils, by increasing vigilance. This is consistent with the smaller body size, inexperience and the presumed greater vulnerability of juveniles to predation. The lack of appropriate anti-predator responses to foxes suggests that eastern quolls would be vulnerable to predation by foxes in Tasmania."
"Bayer, Benedikt; Simoni, Alessandro; Mulas, Marco; Corsini, Alessandro; Schmidt, David","Deformation responses of slow moving landslides to seasonal rainfall in the Northern Apennines, measured by InSAR",GEOMORPHOLOGY,308,293,306,10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.02.020,2018,"Slow moving landslides are widespread geomorphological features in the Northern Apennines of Italy where they represent one of the main landscape forming processes. The lithology of the Northern Apennines fold and thrust belt is characterized by alternations of sandstone, siltstone and clayshales, also known as flysch, and clay shales with a chaotic block in matrix fabric, which are often interpreted as tectonic or sedimentary melanges. While flysch rocks with a high pelitic fraction host earthslides that occasionally evolve into flow like movements, earthflows are the dominant landslide type in chaotic clay shales. In the present work, we document the kinematic response to rainfall of landslides in these different lithologies using radar interferometry. The study area includes three river catchments in the Northern Apennines. Here, the Mediterranean climate is characterized by two wet seasons during autumn and spring respectively, separated by dry summers and winters with moderate precipitation. We use SAR imagery from the X-band satellite COSMO SkyMed and from the C-band satellite Sentinel 1 to retrieve spatial displacement measurements between 2009 and 2016 for 25 landslides in our area of interest. We also document detailed temporal and spatial deformation signals for eight representative landslides, although the InSAR derived deformation signal is only well constrained by our dataset during the years 2013 and 2015. In spring 2013, long enduring rainfalls struck the study area and numerous landslide reactivations were documented by the regional authorities. During 2013, we measured higher displacement rates on the landslides in pelitic flysch formations compared to the earthflows in the clay shales. Slower mean velocities were measured on most landslides during 2015. We analyse the temporal deformation signal of our eight representative landslides and compare the temporal response to precipitation. We show that earthslides in pelitic flysch formations accelerate faster than earthflows in chaotic clay shales and reach higher velocities, while the kinematic behaviour of the earthflows can be described as rather steady with only minor accelerations. Although we have no detailed pore pressure measurements for the period of interest, the observed behaviour can be explained in our view by the morphological and hydrological characteristics of the different landslide types. On the one hand landslide material and bedrock in the pelitic flysch rocks are more resistant, which is why slope angles are higher in this lithology. On the other hand, landslides in the pelitic flysch formations have often deeper slip surfaces and landslide material is more permeable. This is why long persistent rainfall is necessary to saturate the landslide material and induce pore pressures that are high enough to trigger displacement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, specialized thieves of the Neotropical ant, Ectatomma ruidum, also known as the thieving ant', regularly enter and steal resources from distinct, neighboring colonies. Here, we examine the mechanisms and consequences of thievery in a population of E.ruidum. We show that (1) individuals from nearby colonies were accepted more often than those from farther colonies; (2) rejection rates decreased as individuals interacted more with non-nestmates from the same source colony; and (3) colonies that were experimentally treated to reduce thievery rates had improved productivity. The boost in productivity with thievery reduction was greater in low density populations than in high density populations. We conclude that, as in other species, thievery has negative fitness costs to E.ruidum. However, greater acceptance of neighbors than non-neighbors and increased acceptance after habituation to non-nestmates suggest a proximate explanation for the presence of thievery. Moreover, lower fitness costs of thievery at high nesting density, combined with observations of extraordinarily high densities of E.ruidum throughout its range, suggest there is little selection pressure among these ants to guard against thieves, thus providing an ultimate explanation why thievery persists among litter-foraging ants.Resumen La mayoria de los animales sociales tienen mecanismos para discernir entre miembros propios de los ajenos al grupo, en parte para prevenir la explotacion de recursos reservados para el grupo. En contraste con este patron, hormigas especializadas de la especie Neotropical Ectatomma ruidum, conocida como hormiga ladrona, regularmente roban recursos de colonias vecinas. En este trabajo examinamos los mecanismos y consecuencias del robo en una poblacion de E.ruidum y mostramos que: (1) las hormigas de colonias vecinas cercanas fueron aceptadas mas frecuentemente que hormigas de colonias lejanas; (2) el grado de rechazo disminuyo cuando hubo interaccion mas frecuente con hormigas ajenas provenientes de una misma colonia, y (3) las colonias tratadas experimentalmente para reducir el grado de robo tuvieron mayor productividad comparadas con colonias donde las ladronas permanecieron. El aumento en productividad fue mas evidente en poblaciones pequenas. En contraste, las colonias con alta densidad poblacional no mostraron un incremento en productividad evidente despues de remover a las ladronas. Concluimos que, al igual que en otras especies, el robo tiene costos negativos en el fitness. Sin embargo, la mayor aceptacion de vecinas que no-vecinas y el incremento en aceptacion despues de un periodo de habituacion a las foraneas sugiere una posible explicacion para la presencia del robo. Ademas, mostramos que hay un menor costo de fitness por robo en nidos populosos. Esta observacion, combinada con el hecho de que E.ruidum prevalece en altas densidades poblacionales ofrece una explicacion a la persistencia del robo entre hormigas de la hojarasca."

The roe deer, Capreolus capreolus (L., 1758), is one of the foremost examples of behavioural flexibility among ungulates. This species has increased rapidly in range from its original forest-mosaic habitat into open agricultural plains. Open-land roe deer populations show distinct differences in spatial and social behaviour, including larger group sizes, compared with forest-living roe deer populations. This is traditionally viewed as an antipredator strategy. The presence of strong behavioural plasticity in species response to landscape structure suggests that this should also be a concern in models attempting to describe effects of landscape change on species distribution. To date the implications of behavioural plasticity for modelling species' response to environmental conditions has received little attention. We used an individual-based model of roe deer to evaluate the consequences of behavioural plasticity for predictions made regarding population response to woodland fragmentation. The inclusion of a flexible behavioural strategy, where increased group size could buffer lack of woodland cover, resulted in significantly higher estimates of population size, population persistence, and the ability of the population to cope with fragmentation. This clearly demonstrates that behavioural plasticity in species response to landscape structure may affect our ability to accurately predict the effects of landscape change and should be a concern to modellers."

Nest structures vary considerably across avian taxa and for many species the structure of the completed nest can have important consequences both for parents and their offspring. While nest characteristics are expected to vary adaptively in response to environmental conditions, large-scale spatial variation in nest characteristics has been largely overlooked. Here, we examine the effects of latitudinal variation in spring temperatures on nest characteristics, including insulatory properties, and reproductive success of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, and great tits, Parus major. Location Great Britain. Methods Nests and reproductive data were collected from seven study sites, spread over 5 degrees of latitude. The nest insulatory properties were then determined before the nests were separated into nest base material and cup lining material. Results As spring temperatures increased with decreasing latitude, the mass of the nest base material did not vary in either species, while the mass of the cup lining material and nest insulatory properties decreased in both species. This suggests that in response to increasing temperatures the breeding female reduces the mass of the cup lining material, thereby maintaining an appropriate microclimate for incubating and brooding. The mean first egg date of both species advanced with decreasing latitude and increasing spring temperatures, although clutch size and brood size at hatching and fledging did not vary. Main conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate that the nest-construction behaviour of birds varies in response to large-scale spatial variation in ambient temperatures. Therefore, nest composition reliably indicates environmental conditions and we suggest that studies of nest structure may be sentinels for the early signs of rapid climate change."

Research and intervention with adolescents require reliable instruments to assess decision-making. The Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire (MDMQ) is an instrument that assesses decision-making styles and has been successfully validated in different cultural contexts. This study analysed the psychometric properties, construct validity (factorial, convergent, and discriminant), and predictive validity of the MDMQ in Colombian adolescents. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which 822 adolescents aged 14 to 18 years (M = 16.09, SD = 1.31, 33.7% girls), 410 from the regular school system (M = 15.50, SD = 1.29, 48.54% girls) and 412 adolescents from the Criminal Responsibility System (M = 16.6, SD = 1.04, 18.93% girls) participated. Decision-making styles, emotional intelligence, cognitive distortions, prosocial behaviour and antisocial behaviour were assessed. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), reliability, correlational and predictive analyses were performed. Results: The CFA showed satisfactory fit indices for the original model of four factors and 22 items. Sufficient reliability conditions were observed. The results indicated that rational decision-making (vigilance) is positively associated with emotional intelligence and influences prosocial behaviour. Negative decision-making styles are associated with cognitive distortions and influence antisocial behaviour. Conclusions: After analysing the psychometric properties, it is concluded that the MDMQ is a valid instrument to assess the decision-making styles of Colombian adolescents.

Such findings raise the question whether trainability, which is fundamentally important in practice, could also be affected by stereotypic behaviour. Trainability of a horse is difficult to assess in simple tests, however, it is reliably estimated by experienced riders.To assess trainability and other characteristics related to that, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the owners of 50 crib-biting and 50 control horses. Where possible, control horses were selected from the same establishment as crib-biters. Groups did not differ significantly regarding age, breed, gender, training level or usage.Principal component analysis revealed three main factors which can be labelled as 'Anxiety', 'Affability' and 'Trainability'. The 'Anxiety' factor consisted of the items 'Nervousness', 'Excitability', 'Panic', 'Inconsistent emotionality', 'Vigilance', 'Skittishness', and 'Timidity'. 'Affability' consisted of 'Friendliness toward people', 'Cooperation', 'Docility' and 'Friendliness toward horses'. 'Trainability' involved 'Concentration', 'Trainability', 'Memory', and 'Perseverance'.Temperament traits were not affected by age, gender, breed or training level, but the usage of the horse and the presence of crib-biting behaviour had significant effects. Competition horses had lower level of 'Anxiety' (p = 0.032) and higher level of 'Trainability' (p = 0.068) than leisure horses.Crib-biting horses had significantly lower level of 'Anxiety' than control horses (p < 0.001), while 'Trainability' and 'Affability' did not differ between groups (p = 0.823 and p = 0.543, respectively).Competition horses are more often exposed to novel environment and to frightening stimuli (e.g. colourful obstacles) than leisure horses and therefore might have also become more habituated to these types of stimuli. Coping with novel situation may be enhanced by defusing nervous behaviour by the more experienced riders of competition.Previous studies indicated crib-biting horses to be less reactive when challenged as compared to control horses. We suggest that the virtual calmness and lower nervousness of the crib-biting horses might be due to the passive coping style of these animals.'Affability' of horses might be more related to housing and management conditions than to crib-biting. Contrary to expectations, scores on 'Trainability' had not coincided with the impaired learning of crib-biting horses reported in laboratory tests. However, previous behavioural tests on equine learning rarely had a direct relevance to the training abilities of the horses.Our results do not support crib-biting stereotypy to affect performance in training, which is a complex learning process involving cooperation and docility in the social environment.

Several resident and migratory birds live in coastal lagoons as well as fish and other aquatic biota. Over the years, lagoons worldwide have been subject to considerable sediment deposition coming especially from soil erosion due of agricultural activities, and the lagoon's inflows have resulted in an accelerated sedimentation which can drastically affect the aquatic ecosystem balance. A new, fast, and cost-effective approach was developed, using water surface change as a proxy, to evaluate the sediment deposition rate. In the current research, this methodology was applied in the Moulay Bousselham Lagoon in Morocco, and a combination of Landsat 8 and Landsat 5 imagery acquired at four points in time over 30 years (1985-2015) was used. Following geometric correction and enhancement, the interpretation of the acquired images provided important insight on the current conditions of the water surface change using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Several iterations were done to determine a suitable threshold for effective water surface detection. In order to validate the automatically extracted water surface features, many band combinations of Landsat and Sentinel 2 were used as references to run the accuracy assessment. The results show that the Moulay Bousselham Lagoon lost 17.60% (106 ha) of its water surface area, and 530,000 m(3) to 1,060,000 m(3) of its water volume during the last three decades. Converting water surface loss into sedimentation returned a rate of 0.58 cm/yr. These results have been confirmed by previous field work using sedimentological approaches. Proper management should be applied to sustain the vitality of this lagoon environment.

There are two, nonexclusive, hypotheses typically proposed to explain the formation of social groups: increased predator vigilance and greater foraging efficiency. In mixed-species groups, these hypotheses are typically tested with species-level summary measures such as flocking propensity, the assignment of species-level roles, mean body size, and foraging and habitat characteristics. Literature syntheses make it clear that while these hypotheses are important, much about mixed-species groups remains unexplained. We suggest that we can substantially increase our understanding of the evolution and ecology of mixed-species social groups in terms of both traditional and novel hypotheses by shifting the analytical focus to bottom-up approaches common in intraspecific investigations of sociality. Bottom-up approaches to analyses of social structure treat pairwise interactions as the fundamental unit of analysis and social structure as an emergent property rather than relying on a priori assignments of species as units of association. The construction of social networks from pairwise interaction rates allows us to assess the factors that promote group formation on the basis of individuals, a more appropriate level of selection, rather than species groups. We illustrate this approach with data from mixed-species foraging assemblies in tits (Paridae), finding significant effects of dominance on social behaviour within species. This new focus allows us to address questions about active associations among heterospecifics, the role of individuals within mixed-species societies, and the role of environments, which will collectively provide a richer description of the evolution and function of mixed-species societies.

Some species are very flexible in their habitat requirements. One such species may be Colobus angolensis ruwenzorii, monkeys that occupy montane and tropical lowland forest. In the mountains of southwestern Rwanda, this species spends a great deal of time on the ground and feeds mainly on mature leaves and lichens, but the habitat use of lower altitude populations is unknown. We examined the fine-scale habitat use of C. a. ruwenzorii at Nabugabo, Uganda (1136 m altitude), where they feed primarily on young leaves and fruits. We used data collected over 9 mo (94 days between July 2017 and April 2018) on 117-131 colobus in 12 core units in a multilevel society. We found that colobus individuals were rarely on the ground, and resting and social behavior occurred at higher heights and in larger trees than feeding and moving. Individual height in the canopy followed a daily pattern (higher at the start and end, with a decrease in the middle of the day) and colobus were at lower heights when group size was greater because of core unit fusion. Finally, we found that tree species were generally used relative to their availability in the forest and their value as food species. Given greater predation risk in smaller groups and lower in the canopy at this site, our results suggest that perceived risk has an important effect on microhabitat use in C. a. ruwenzorii at lower altitude. Our results demonstrate the ecological flexibility of this primate species, which bodes well for their continued conservation."
"Ericsson, Goran; Neumann, Wiebke; Dettki, Holger",Moose anti-predator behaviour towards baying dogs in a wolf-free area,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,61,575,582,10.1007/s10344-015-0932-6,2015,"Understanding the impact of human activity on prey anti-predator behaviour is becoming increasingly important. For many species, hunting is the dominating mortality cause in areas where predators are functionally extinct. In a controlled field experiment in Northern Sweden devoid of wolves, we exposed adult female moose (Alces alces) to hunting activity using a dog (Canis lupus familiaris) to study individual moose anti-predator behaviour. Moose were more active, had larger 24-h activity ranges and left the area after the disturbance. Our study supports the existence of several anti-predator strategies within a species even when predators are absent. A mixed strategy among individuals may be beneficial when a new predator eventually enters the system. Instead of fronting as expected from other study systems, most individuals fled when confronted. We argue that heavily harvested Scandinavian moose may be more adapted to human and bear predation in contrast to the suggested behavioural maladaption towards wolf predation. We build on two major lines of arguments; first, being less defensive, but fleeing when approached by a baying dog which mimics wolf encounters, is likely to increase moose survival compared with the risk to be shot when being defensive and fronting, held at bay. Secondly, we assume that escaping in a tortuous manner, i.e. in an unpredictable way, may increase the chance to undergo persecution by increasing the chance that chaser switches the target animal, especially in areas of high moose density. We recommend future studies to address individual variation and behavioural plasticity in anti-predator behaviour."

A recent study showed that large primates display weaker countershading compared with small species, possibly due to a reduced predation risk. In addition to body mass, other factors likely affect countershading intensity. We predicted that if countershading is related to crypsis, then countershading intensity should be negatively related to the frequency of being in a vertical postural position because dorsoventral countershading is most effective when an animal adopts a horizontal position. In addition, countershading intensity may be positively related to group size if individuals are more conspicuous living in large groups or negatively related to group size if countershading further enhances a cryptic life style. We used color-corrected digital photographs of museum skins to quantify the luminance values of the ventral and dorsal surfaces of 113 primate species. We analyzed these data in a multiple regression using phylogenetically independent contrasts. While accounting for body mass, we found a significant negative relationship between the degree of countershading and the frequency of being in a vertical postural position. In contrast, we did not find a strong effect of group size on countershading. Our results suggest that countershading is weak or absent in species of any size that often adopt vertical postural positions because a crypsis benefit is only gained when being horizontal. Finally, the increased conspicuousness of species in large groups does not have a major effect on countershading intensity."

As a consequence, individuals in groups can adopt more risky, but rewarding, foraging behaviors without exposing themselves to excessive danger. I experimentally manipulated the size of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) groups to determine if individuals in large groups do forage in a more risky manner. I found that prairie dogs foraged more alertly and in less risky locations (nearer to burrows, nearer to the center of the group, and in shorter vegetation) when group size was reduced. Effects of group-size reductions were reversed when removed individuals were replaced, and persisted for at least three weeks in experiments where group size was permanently reduced. My results provide evidence that the relationships between group size and both alertness and risk-place foraging are causal."

Work by our research group shows that migratory shorebirds adjust their usage of, and behavior at, stopover sites in response to environmental conditions. Motivated by this, we built an individual-based model of migrating shorebirds moving through a sequence of alternating small and large stopover sites. Birds at larger sites are safer from predators, but we assumed that less food is available than at small sites. In the model, both predation risk and food intake are density-dependent, and the behavior of migrants is controlled by two rules: one that determines whether a bird will depart a stopover site, and one that controls the individual's foraging versus vigilance intensity. The optimal behavior is calculated by maximizing a payoff function that depends on arrival date and arrival energy stores at the final site. We used this model to predict mass gain, foraging intensity, and usage by migrants of small and large sites under various conditions. We examined the effects of a flyway-wide reduction in the amount of food, a flyway-wide increase in predation danger, and the effects of lowering the overall population size. The mass action of many individuals, each optimizing its migration timing and routing, leads to the emergence of distinctive patterns of behavior and site choice under these differing environmental conditions. When food availability is reduced throughout the flyway, Our model predicts that foraging intensity increases at every stopover site, thereby forcing birds to accept greater danger to maintain the fitness benefit of a timely arrival to the breeding area. A flyway-wide increase in predation danger results in fewer migrants choosing (and/or migrants staying a shorter time at) small stopover sites, balanced by a higher usage of large sites. These effects contrast with what is observed under true population declines, when the usage of both small and large sites declines."
AMAT J A,NUMERICAL TRENDS HABITAT USE AND ACTIVITY OF GREYLAG GEESE WINTERING IN SOUTHWESTERN SPAIN,Wildfowl,37,35,45,,1986,"The size of the Greylag Goose Anser anser population wintering in the Marismas of the Guadalquivir (SW Spain) has increased from 15,000-25,000 birds in the early 1970s to more than 75,000 birds in the middle of the 1980s. Under normal flooding conditions, most Greylags are found in Scirpus-dominated zones adjacent to the roosting places; under drought conditions the geese also use other habitat types, such as cultivated fields (autumn sown cereals and ricefields) and grasslands, 1-5 km from the roosting places. Probably as a consequence of the population increase, the use of grasslands has become more prominent in recent years even when these are rainy. Feeding mostly occurs in the morning and late afternoon, and resting mainly takes place around midday. Under drought conditions, the geese spend more time feeding than under normal flooding conditions: yet their foraging return would be lower because of the lower profitability of the food available under such conditions. Throughout the winter, there is an increase in feeding at the expense of resting and vigilance; this may be in relation to the need for fat accumulation to face the spring migration. For adult birds this would be facilitated by the relaxation of their parental duties in the late winter. The recent increasing use of grasslands may indicate that the carrying capacity of Scirpus habitats has been reached, and therefore that the population would be seriously stressed under extreme drought conditions, such as those of the winter 1980-1, when 10,000 Greylags died mainly from starvation."

Plains zebras (Equus quagga) and Grevy's zebras (E. grevyi) frequently form mixed-species groups in zones where their ranges overlap in Kenya. Although anecdotal observations suggest that Plains zebras are more flighty around humans than Grevy's zebras are, this has not been empirically confirmed, and relatively little is known about how they may influence each other's flight behavior. We addressed these questions by examining the flight initiation distances (FIDs) of Plains and Grevy's zebras in single-species and mixed-species groups from an approaching human. One target individual per group was approached steadily on foot, with start distance, alert distance, and FID recorded from this target. Using start distance and alert distance separately as covariates, 22 Plains zebras in single-species groups exhibited a significantly longer mean FID than 15 Grevy's zebras in single-species groups. The FIDs of 7 Plains zebras and 5 Grevy's zebras tested in mixed-species groups were virtually equivalent and intermediate to those of Plains and Grevy's zebras in single-species groups, suggesting a bidirectional moderating influence of heterospecifics on risk assessment. This effect was most pronounced for Plains zebras in mixed-species groups that exhibited an FID that was significantly shorter than that of Plains zebras in single-species groups. Our findings underscore the importance of recognizing that related equids may be differently impacted by anthropogenic stress."

Possible use of the BG Sentinel (BGS) trap to sample Anopheles gambiae s.s. was evaluated. The efficiency of this trap was compared with that of the Mosquito Magnet-X (MM-X) trap, when baited with foot odour alone or combinations of foot odour with carbon dioxide (CO2) or lemongrass as behaviour-modifying cues. Methods: Female An. gambiae s.s. were released in an experimental flight arena that was placed in a semi-field system and left overnight. Catch rates for the MM-X and BGS traps were recorded. Data were analysed by fitting a generalized linear model to the (n+1) transformed catches. Results: Both types of traps successfully captured mosquitoes with all odour cues used. When the BGS trap was tested against the MM-X trap in a choice assay with foot odour as bait, the BGS trap caught about three times as many mosquitoes as the MM-X trap (P = 0.002). Adding CO2 (500 ml/ min) to foot odour increased the number of mosquitoes caught by 268% for the MM-X (P < 0.001) and 34% (P = 0.051) for the BGS trap, compared to foot odour alone. When lemongrass leaves were added to foot odour, mosquito catches were reduced by 39% (BGS, P < 0.001) and 38% (MM- X, P = 0.353), respectively. Conclusion: The BGS trap shows high potential for field trials due to its simple construction and high catch rate when baited with human foot odour only. However, for rapid screening of different baits in a contained semi-field system, the superior discriminatory power of the MM-X trap is advantageous."

Animals rely on indirect cues in the environment, including availability of protective cover, openness of sightlines and distance to refuge to evaluate potential predation risk. Interactions between the indirect cues that influence an animal's perception of predation risk are poorly understood, especially for prey at risk of avian and terrestrial predation. We conducted a giving-up density (GUD) study to examine how interactions between terrestrial predator presence, ceiling (canopy) cover, wall (shrub/grass) cover and distance to nearest tree influence fox squirrel, Sciurus niger, risk perception. The GUD indicates an animal's perceived predation risk, such that increased GUD (decreased foraging) corresponds to greater perceived risk. We found that fox squirrels perceived cues of predation risk in response to a synergistic interaction between ceiling and wall cover. In open canopy areas, fox squirrels increased GUD where there was also increased wall cover. However, fox squirrels reduced GUD in closed canopy areas where there was also increased wall cover. We attribute the differential effects of wall cover depending on ceiling cover to the effectiveness of open sightlines in decreasing predation risk from avian or terrestrial predators. Our study shows that the effect of vegetation structure on prey risk perception and antipredator behaviour depends on the relative risk posed by avian and terrestrial predators that use different hunting strategies.

As structurally complex habitats can reduce predation risk, prey within heterogeneous environments may have evolved sensory abilities to locate them. In temperate rocky intertidal systems, fucoid seaweeds are a main source of structural complexity and can provide shelter for small organisms. This study examined the effects of predation risk on habitat selection in a tide pool-dwelling shrimp, Palaemon affinis, specifically testing whether predation risk drives preferences for fucoid seaweeds and if shrimps use chemical cues to locate fucoid-rich habitats. While tide pools with and without fucoids were equally abundant, P. affinis densities were >3 times higher in pools containing fucoids. The relationship between P. affinis and fucoids appears to be related to predation risk with P. affinis exhibiting a preference for fucoid microhabitats when a potential predator was present. Shrimps could distinguish between olfactory signatures from tide pools with and without fucoids and the odor of fucoids from other marine algae, suggesting that chemical cues are used to identify these structurally complex habitats. In addition to reducing predation risk, fucoid- rich habitats may provide better access to essential resources and reduce exposure to other biotic and abiotic stressors. This study shows that prey organisms can rapidly modify habitat use based on ambient predation risk, with olfactory cues used to identify the shelter characteristics of different habitats."

This collective behavior is often led by a few individuals of specific gender, social rank, or spatial physical location in the group (i.e., perimeter or front). We examined how individual social voles () in same-gender compared with mixed-gender groups respond to an owl attack. We found that anxiety level, as measured by the time that each individual spent in less-sheltered sectors (open arms of elevated plus-maze and center of open arena), was affected by both the social context and the gender of the tested individuals. While both female and male voles generally reduced their activity in the open following owl attack, males in mixed-gender groups were exceptional in dichotomizing into those that spent a short period and those that spent a long period in the open arms of the plus-maze. Based on the similar responses of the same-gender groups, we suggest that anxiety is contagious, and based on the lower anxiety level of the mixed-gender groups, we suggest that natural groups that comprise both males and females are better able to cope with life-threat compared with same-gender groups. Finally, we suggest that the differential responses of males in the mixed-gender groups were due to a few males that displayed a low level of anxiety. These males were probably individuals of high social rank, and their response reflects their natural protective role, as previously described in social voles."

A number of game theoretic models (joint ideal free distributions, IFD) have suggested that a population-level distribution of mobile predators and mobile prey in which predators match the distribution of the prey's resources and prey are more evenly distributed will be stable. However, prey can often manage their exposure to predation risk by adjusting their space use and their level of apprehension or vigilance, while predators have been shown to behaviorally manage the risk level perceived by their prey. We used a system of predatory larval dragonflies (Anax junius) and southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala) tadpoles to explore how these species respond spatially to habitat features when alone (non-game situations) and together (game situations), then how predation events are distributed in relation to these features. In game and non-game situations, dragonflies avoided each other and showed no preference for tadpole resource patches, while tadpoles favored their resource patches, avoided caged, feeding dragonflies, and used a combination of avoidance and activity reduction to reduce their predation risk. Predation events were generally distributed closer to resource patches and farther from caged predators. The results suggest that dragonflies and tadpoles do not directly follow joint IFD predictions, but manage fear and risk through their behavioral strategies. The results also suggest that stationary or slowly-changing habitat features can anchor predator-prey spatial distributions, but that they are likely to be temporally variable in some systems."

However, intraspecific aggregation can decrease developmental rates and survival in prey species. We investigated the impact on tadpole development and behaviour of the interaction between population density and predation risk. Spotted tree frog (Litoria spenceri: Hylidae, Dubois 1984) tadpoles were kept at one of three different densities (two tadpoles per litre, five tadpoles per litre or 10 tadpoles per litre) until metamorphosis in the presence or absence of predatory cues. We aimed to determine the influence of population density, predation and the interaction of both factors in determining growth rates in tadpoles. Tadpoles were measured weekly to assess growth and development and filmed to quantify differences in activity and feeding frequency between groups. Generally, tadpoles housed without predators had longer developmental periods when housed with a predator, but there was no effect on tail length or total length. There was no effect of either predation cues or density on percentage of individuals feeding or moving. Although the effects of the presence of predators alone may appear to be less than the effects of the presence of competitors, the prioritisation of competitiveness over predator avoidance may increase vulnerability of tadpoles to the lethal threat of predators. This is particularly important in species such as L. spenceri, which is at risk from introduced fish predators."

Experience allows offspring to modify responses to specific threats and also leaves them vulnerable during the learning period. However, antipredator behaviors used at one stage of a predator encounter may compensate for deficiencies at another stage, a phenomenon that may reduce the overall risk of young that are vulnerable at one or more stages. Few studies have examined age differences in the effectiveness of antipredator behaviors across multiple stages of a predator encounter. In this study, we examined age differences in the antipredator behaviors of California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi) during the detection, interaction, and attack stages of Pacific rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus) encounters. Using free-ranging squirrels, we examined the ability to detect free-ranging rattlesnakes, snake-directed behaviors after discovery of a snake, and responses to simulated rattlesnake strikes. We found that age was the most important factor in snake detection, with adults being more likely to detect snakes than pups. We also found that adults performed more tail flagging (a predator-deterrent signal) toward snakes and were more likely to investigate a snake's refuge when interacting with a hidden snake. In field experiments simulating snake strikes, adults exhibited faster reaction times than pups. Our results show that snake detection improves with age and that pups probably avoid rattlesnakes and minimize time spent in close proximity to them to compensate for their reduced reaction times to strikes."

These cues can either be direct (i.e. signalling the possible presence of a predator) or indirect (i.e. linked to the likelihood of encountering a predator). How then do herbivores negotiate these multiple cues in the landscape? And which type of cues do foraging herbivores use to assess variation in predation risk? We examined these questions by investigating the foraging responses of a free-ranging marsupial herbivore, the common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula to perceived predation risk. We found that indirect habitat-related cues of predation (i.e. feeder location) consistently influenced foraging, while other more variable indirect (i.e. illumination) and direct cues (i.e. predator odour) did not. Giving-up-density at above-ground feeders was always lower than at on-ground feeders. Possums spent more time and foraged more at the above-ground feeders than at the on-ground feeders. Our results demonstrate that when multiple cues are present, varying in the accuracy of the information they provide about predation risk, possums respond to habitat-related cues. Possums manage risk by modifying behaviours, reducing time spent foraging in areas where potential risk is perceived as high. Thus, when the location of a predator at a certain point in time and space is unknown, and food demands are high, habitat-related cues are a safe choice to assess predation risk, with reliable returns for free-ranging herbivores."

How animals balance the competing risks of starvation and predation mortality is an active area of research in a wide variety of predator-prey systems. The non-migratory elk (Cervus elaphus) population in the Madison headwaters area of Yellowstone National Park provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate prey grouping tendencies in the absence of predators and, following wolf (Canis lupus) reestablishment, when faced with trade-offs between avoiding predation and acquiring adequate resources. We collected long-term data on elk grouping behavior prior to wolf reintroduction, during the colonization stage, and after wolves became fully established in the system. Wolf presence varied spatially and temporally within and among years, and there was a wide range of snow conditions during the 16-year study. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate competing hypotheses on whether elk formed larger or smaller aggregations when wolves were present, ( 2) determine if grouping strategies changed under different abiotic conditions, and (3) determine if variability in group size increased following wolf reintroduction as elk responded to fine-scale temporal variation in predation risk."

We studied the tolerance of Indian birds to approaching people by recording the flush distance for 925 individuals of 138 species of residents (birds breeding in India) and migrants (birds that are not known to breed in India). Over 20% of the variance in flush distance was accounted for by the number of people situated within 50 m, the distance to the closest person, the bird's migratory status, the number of people approaching, the time of day, and the bird's total body-length (including tail).For migratory species, 43% of the variability in flush distance was accounted for by distance to the closest other person, time of day, number of people originally within 50 m, number of people approaching, flock size, and species size. For resident species, only 18% of the variance was accounted for by distance to the closest other person, number of people within 50 m, and number of people approaching. Migrants were thus more responsive to the effect of humans, and their response was also influenced by their own size (body length) and flock size. Migratory species were less tolerant of people, flushing sooner than residents, and being more sensitive to the number of approaching people.We suggest that resident birds in North India have become habituated to the non-violent protective behaviour of the Hindu people towards birds, whereas migrants from farther north are more wary. Alternatively migrants, being less familiar than residents with the local predators and hiding places, may be more wary than residents on their home territory. Enhanced wariness results in more time spent alert or fleeing, with resultant greater energy-demand and decreased time for feeding."

Samples were collected monthly (December 2011 to November 2012) from two different sites, Sidi Salem a polluted site and Hnaya as a control site. Obtained results revealed an increase in CAT activity and a decrease in GSH rate in fish from the polluted site (Sidi Salem) compared to the control site (Hnaya). The biochemical analysis revealed a significant decrease in protein, lipid and carbohydrate amounts in Sidi Salem comparatively to El Hnaya. In addition, the higher levels in biochemical components (protein, lipid and carbohydrate) are recorded in summer and the lower rates in winter at El Hnaya site, this is related to respectively the beginning and the end of the reproduction period. Thus, the difference noted between the two sites may be due to their pollution level. The level of pollution in Sidi Salem induced an oxidative stress associated with a mobilization of energetic metabolism for detoxification or for physiological processes such as 'owth or reproduction, Overall, obtained data indicate that L. aurata constitutes a useful tool as sentinel organisms for biomonitoring of aquatic pollution."

We used nocturnal video recordings to describe activity and quantify behaviors of females with nestlings of four shrubland bird species and three grassland bird species (n - 19 nests). Among the shrubland birds, Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus), Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor), and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) returned to the nest for the night at the same time, around sunset. Among the grassland birds, Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) returned the earliest before sunset and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) returned the latest after sunset. All species exhibited back sleep with the bill tucked under scapular feathers, and individuals awoke frequently for vigils or peeks at their surroundings. Sleep of all species was disrupted by nestling activity. Average duration of sleep bouts varied from 6 min (Grasshopper Sparrow) to 28 min (Blue-winged Warbler; Field Sparrow, Spizella pusilla). Mean overnight duration on the nest varied from 6.4 hr (Field Sparrow) to 8.8 hr (Indigo Bunting). On average, adults woke in the morning (the last waking before departing the nest) 20 30 min before sunrise. The first absence from the nest in the morning was short for all species, and nestlings were fed within 12 min of a parent's departure. Our study highlights the need for further video research on sleep patterns of nesting birds in the field to better understand basic natural history, energetic cost-benefits of sleep, and behavioral adaptations to environmental pressures."

The aim of the present investigation was to determine the influence of two monoterpenes, 1,8-cineol and (+/-)-linalool, on human sustained attention, physiological arousal and wellbeing. The substances, as well as appropriate placebos, were administered either by inhalation or by skin application to a total of 130 healthy subjects. We found that when the fragrances were applied to the skin 1,8-cineol improved speed of attentional performance in comparison to (+/-)-linalool, but not in comparison to peanut oil, which served as a placebo. Under the same conditions, 1,8-cineol increased respiration rate in comparison to both (+/-)-linalool and placebo. In the inhalation condition, neither attentional performance nor physiological arousal were affected by the fragrances, but both odorants influenced wellbeing, i.e., 1,8-cineol decreased activation and (+/-)-linalool increased it. In contrast, no such effects were observed in the skin application condition. Our results demonstrate that fragrances affect cognitive performance, physiological arousal and wellbeing as a function of the mode of administration."

For penguins in dense colonies, territory defence seems to imply conflicting energetic requirements because of its assumed high energy cost, when the birds need to limit energy expenditure to cope with their fast. In this context, behavioural time budget over 24 h was investigated during breeding in the king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonica, by using a remote-controlled videocamera. The comparison of day-night activity was performed in relation to breeding status (incubation vs. brooding) and duration of fasting (beginning vs. end of incubation shift). Five categories of behaviours were quantified: territory defence, comfort, resting, sleeping and chick-feeding. Breeding king penguins remain active by day as well as by night. Between incubation and brooding we found a three-fold increase in the energy consuming territory defence, together with a drastic decrease in that posture which corresponds to deep sleep, i.e. when most energy is saved. These increases in aggressiveness and vigilance may be related to protection of the newly hatched chick. Between the onset and the end of an incubation shift, the time spent in sleep increases three-fold, whereas territory defence remains unchanged. These data for penguins under natural conditions accord with previous studies on captive birds which have shown that an increasing proportion of sleep during the course of fasting may contribute to energy saving. On the other hand, both resting (which is the main component of penguins' time budget; about 65%) and comfort (about 16% of time) show no change either between incubation and brooding or during the course of fasting."

Pairing chronologies and seasonal changes in time-activity budgets and rates of aggressive interactions were compared in relation to sex, age, and paired status. Results supported the mutual-choice and not the male-costs hypothesis. Paired females gained no immediate benefits relative to unpaired females from mate defense and vigilance, and there was no evidence that females preferred to pair as early as possible, as postulated by the male-costs hypothesis. Unpaired males spent much more time in courtship than paired males spent in mate defense and constraints on male time and energy budgets was not a plausible reason for delayed and protracted pairing of young and re-pairing females. As predicted by the mutual-choice hypothesis, decisions by females about how much time and energy to allocate to the pairing process appeared to be the main factor controlling the timing of pairing in Harlequin Ducks. Newly-pairing females invested an extended period of time in courtship and mate sampling before pairing, in spite of an abundance of courting males clearly energetically capable of maintaining a pair bond. Many young females decided to pair during mid-winter when time constraints to males should have been most severe. Time-budget trade-offs were apparent for young females and their date of pairing was related to the amount of time per day that they allocated to courtship. Pairing success of males was not related to their rate of courtship, nor was it related to the length of time they invested in courtship as they began courting while they were still immature and generally courted for several years before pairing."

Human recreation, especially hunting, can also force prey to increase their vigilance and can influence distribution and habitat use even more than natural predators. However, behavioral effects do not play a prominent role in conservation or wildlife management. Whereas the demographic consequences of hunting are documented for large carnivores, behavioral effects of hunting on their dynamics remain unexplored. We studied the movement patterns of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Scandinavia as a model species, before and after the start of the annual bear hunting season. Bears were expected to become more active at daytime as the season progressed due to shortening daylight. However, the start of hunting disrupted this pattern. Solitary bears subject to hunting increased movements during the dark hours after hunting started, losing their nocturnal rest, probably to compensate for decreased daytime activity. Females with cubs-of-the-year, which are protected from hunting, also modified their movement pattern, but much less than hunted bears. Bears altered their movement pattern at a critical time of the year, during hyperphagia, when they must store fat reserves before hibernation, which is critical for reproduction. Behavioral effects of hunting should be a relevant issue for the conservation and management of large carnivores, especially when hunting occurs during highly sensitive periods of the year. This concern applies to many species managed under hunting regimes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

AD likely mirrors the effort invested into vigilance, while FID provides an estimate of the perceived risk of an approaching threat. Although individual variation in AD and FID is influenced by environmental factors such as variation in predation pressure and human disturbance, the repeatabilities of these traits (especially AD), and therefore their designation as personality traits, remain under-investigated. Here, we studied the repeatability of AD, FID, and the decision to flee in a flightless, ground-breeding seabird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). A single experimenter approached three times over three consecutive days 47 incubating king penguins from two different colonies with varying human disturbance levels. We explored the effects of weather, time of day, and approach speed of the experimenter on these behaviors. Weather had an effect on all three behaviors. In warm, sunny weather AD increased. In rainy, windy weather birds were more likely to flee, but waited longer before initiating flight. Faster approach speeds between AD and FID increased FID. Weather conditions and speed of approach affected repeatability estimates, highlighting the need to consider external sources of variation when refining such estimates. FID and the decision to flee were significantly and moderately repeatable (r = 0.26 and 0.57, respectively), while AD was not. There was no evidence of behavioral habituation or sensitization in either colony."

At the portal of each nest of the Oriental hornet (Vespa orientalis, Hymenoptera, Vespinae) there are worker hornets that beat their wings in synchrony with one another, during summer months and at the onset of daylight. These ventilating hornets stand at regular intervals around the nest entrance, not touching, and with their heads facing largely outwards. Although the ventilating hornets stand apart from one another, their wings beat at a uniform pace and there is no connection whatsoever between these hornets and the sentinel worker hornet (or hornets) that inspect those entering the nest. The ventilatory wing beating lasts 3.4 min on average, and upon completion, the ventilating worker either emerges to forage in the field or more often retreats back into the nest. Young queens have seldom been seen ventilating and males have never been seen engaged in such activity. Ordinarily, no ventilatory activity takes place upon the brood combs inside, such as is observed in artificial breeding boxes with a transparent wall, but on rare occasions ventilation may also occur on the inner side of the portal. In cases where there is more than one portal to the nest, the ventilatory activity will occur at each of these sites. Apparently every hornet worker engages in such ventilation at one time or another and their number at any one time is temperature-dependent, that is, the higher the ambient temperature the greater the number the hornets participating in ventilation. Indeed the correlation between the temperature and the ventilatory activity is positive and highly significant."

Bird plumage can be odorous and consequently nest predators could use odor to identify and locate avian prey, and nest competitors could use odor to assess occupancy of nest cavities by birds. However, despite extensive research on avian nest predation and competition, the costs of olfactory eavesdropping on plumage odor by nest predators or competitors remain largely unknown. We used two experiments to investigate whether feather odor is detected by marsupial species which are competitors for nest hollows and predators of eggs and nestlings of crimson rosellas, Platycercus elegans. In the first experiment, odor presentation at nest boxes utilized by ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and rosellas showed that the latency of possums to enter the nest was shorter when crimson rosella odor was present compared to the controls. In the second experiment, carried out away from nest hollows, brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) discriminated odors of two predators (dingo, Canis lupus dingo, and cat, Felis catus) from crimson rosella and control odors; however, they did not discriminate between crimson rosella odor and a control. We show that marsupials may use feather odor cues to assess nest hollow status, information which could aid their detection of avian prey or their vigilance at nest hollows (for which they compete with parrots). To our knowledge, our study is the first to show that wild mammalian predators and competitors of birds respond to plumage odor at nests and suggest that odor signaling may have hitherto unrecognized costs for birds."

Teals forage mostly with only the bill submerged (eyes above the water surface) in winter, but use a broader foraging repertoire in summer. Given the different environments used by teals over the year, it is likely that such a shift is due to changes in diet, but it may also be caused by differences in predation risk between habitats. However, neither predation risk nor teal behaviour has been studied with consistent methods around the year or throughout any of its flyways. Covering wintering, spring-staging, breeding and moulting sites, we combined focal observations of teals and predator flyover data from seven regions ranging from southern France to northern Sweden. Although not apparent at the scale of days within sites, teals indeed relied more on shallow foraging where predation risk was higher, i.e. at wintering sites. Average foraging depth increased gradually from September to August, i.e. from wintering to breeding sites. Foraging bout length of deeply foraging teals did not decrease over the year, suggesting that it is through selection of foraging technique, rather than by the balance between foraging and interruptions, that birds adjust to predation risk. This study highlights behavioural plasticity in response to contrasting selection regimes within a flyway, in dabbling ducks as well as long-distance migrants in general.

However, because predators are usually rare, it has proved difficult to obtain observations differing only in the degree of danger, or to record sufficient naturally provoked alarm calls for fully replicated playback experiments. In this study, we took advantage of a system in which the major aerial predator was common, allowing repeated, matched observations of natural interactions between predator and prey, combined with a fully replicated playback experiment. We found that the aerial trill alarm call of the white-browed scrubwren, Sericornis frontalis, varied according to the distance from the suddenly appearing predator: the closer the predator, the greater the number of elements in the call and the higher their minimum frequency (pitch). Playback experiments showed that multi-element alarm calls prompted a more urgent response, including immediate fleeing to cover. Furthermore, the response was graded, such that an alarm with more elements provoked a more urgent response. Our study therefore isolated the effect of predator distance on alarm call design, and showed that individuals respond appropriately to calls in the absence of any other cues. To our knowledge, this is the most explicit demonstration that avian flee alarm calls can convey urgency."

The American pika (Ochotona princeps) has been suggested as a sentinel of montane climate change, largely due to its sensitivity to warm temperatures and high exposure to changing climatic conditions. Pikas use talus to thermoregulate and have been shown to persist more often in talus slopes that create stable microclimates. However, many studies of pika behavior and persistence use metrics of climate measured above the talus surface, outside of the proposed microclimates that pikas can access. We paired fine-scale microclimate measurements with behavioral observations of uniquely tagged pikas in the Colorado Rocky Mountains to model how pikas might use talus subsurface habitat as a microrefuge. Our findings suggest that pikas spend more time on the surface of the talus when there is a stronger gradient in temperatures between shallow (0.1 m below the surface) and deep (1 m below the surface) regions of the talus, especially during the middle of the day when shallow temperatures are warmer. These results underscore the importance of pairing fine-scale data on microclimate with behavioral observations of tagged individuals to more accurately evaluate how animals might use climate refugia to persist in changing conditions."

Feeders were studied during two consecutive periods from October 2009 to May 2011 in an agricultural area of northwest Spain. Camera trapping was used in order to assess climatic effects on weekly feeding patterns, investigate the influence of shrub cover on feed-site selection and evaluate behavioural patterns displayed when using feeders. Red-legged partridges used feeders throughout the study period, but particularly from December to February. No significant correlations were observed between the weekly number of photographs and climate conditions. A bimodal circadian feeding pattern was observed during daylight hours with peaks of activity in the morning and evening while, in central hours, the feeding visits decreased. We observed significant differences in the number of partridges photographed during the feeding visits along the study period. The use of feeders was not influenced by the presence of surrounding vegetation nor type of feeder. The behavioural analysis classified partridges in five different categories: feeding (33.5 and 32.3% for each period respectively), vigilance (26.8 and 30.7%), moving/unknown (25.9 and 20.6%), pecking/dusting (11.2 and 15%) and other behaviours (2.8 and 1.8%). The percentage of vigilant birds photographed at feeders was not related to the covey size. This study demonstrates the use of the feeders by Red-legged Partridges but does not prove the potential benefits."

In this study, we aimed to investigate 24 h cycle of black-headed gulls (BHG) Chroicocephalus ridibundus activity with focus on sleep behaviour. We expected that 24 h patterns of activity differ between colonies located in various habitats, and within a colony between nests located in the centre vs at the edge. We studied behaviour based on 9600 of 30 s videos from camera-traps taken in six colonies and data from 10 GPS-tracked individuals from one colony recorded during incubation. BHGs stayed active on average during 48.1% of a night, mainly spent on passive and active nest defence, and on nest maintenance. BHGs spent similar time on these activities in day hours. Individuals breeding in the colony centre slept at night longer than those at its edge. BHGs stayed active during on average 76.5% of daytime. In two urban colonies with the highest nest densities and highest level of light pollution birds slept less during the day than in other studied colonies (three rural and one urban) characterized by lower densities and light intensity after sunset near the colony. Knowledge of nocturnal behaviour is crucial to comprehend 24 h activity patterns of an organism, especially to understand flexibility of behaviour crucial for restoration, like sleep."

"Zaccaroni, M.; Ciuffreda, M.; Paganin, M.; Beani, L.",Does an early aversive experience to humans modify antipredator behaviour in adult Rock partridges?,ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,19,193,200,,2007,"One factor critical to the success of a captive-bred animal in nature is its antipredator behaviour, which is often either inadequate or almost absent under intensive rearing conditions. In this study we evaluated the effects of an early stressful experience (i.e. a rough visual and acoustical contact with humans) on the antipredatory reactions of adult Rock partridges. During the 1st week after hatching, one group of Rock partridges was exposed to repeated human intrusions into its aviary, and another undisturbed group served as control. Five months later, we observed that the escape reaction to an approaching human was elicited at greater distances in the experimental group than in the control one. On the other hand, the repeated disturbance by a human did not affect the reactions to raptor and fox dummies, which were however appropriate to the predator. In the Rock partridge the effect of this early aversive interaction was thus stimulus-specific, increasing defensive response only to the predator they experienced, although avoidance behaviour was not generalized to further common predators of these game-birds. This study stresses the importance, in farm reared birds, of the early experience of specific aversive stimuli to develop long-term appropriate responses to predators, and thus to increase the probability of survival after release in nature."
"Lazarus, John",Negativity bias: An evolutionary hypothesis and an empirical programme,LEARNING AND MOTIVATION,75,,,10.1016/j.lmot.2021.101731,2021,"Across many psychological domains there is evidence of negativity bias: the greater subjective potency of negative events when compared with positive events of the same objective magnitude. Here I propose a general evolutionary explanation for the phenomenon: the concave fitness-state (CFS) hypothesis. The CFS hypothesis proposes, with evidence from feeding, drinking and economic domains, that various motivational, emotional and cognitive states - through which stimuli activate responses - have a concave downwards (diminishing returns) relationship with fitness. Where this is the case it follows that a reduction in state, due to a negative stimulus, reduces fitness more than a positive stimulus of equal objective magnitude increases it, producing - the hypothesis consequently predicts - a negativity bias due to the difference in subjective stimulus potency. In discussing other approaches to understanding the phenomenon I critique the proposal that negativity bias can be explained as an adaptive response to the particular importance and urgency of dealing with threat, by arguing that: (1) where negative stimuli interpretable as threat, and contrasting positive stimuli, cannot be measured in a commensurate manner they cannot be validly tested for negativity bias; and (2) since threat stimuli and positive stimuli generally impact different states a greater potency for threat stimuli should generally be interpreted in terms of motivational competition rather than negativity bias. I suggest two ways of circumventing the problem of incommensurate stimuli when studying stimulus bias. The first is to use the loss aversion paradigm: rating the value of the same stimulus when presented as either a gain or a loss in relation to a reference value. Second, understanding the relative subjective potencies of positive and negative stimuli across a range of objective stimulus magnitudes, even when incommensurate, can be achieved experimentally by finding pairs of positive and negative stimuli which, though measured on different scales of magnitude, are equipotent. That is, they have equal and opposite effects on fitness, well-being or stimulus evaluation. These stimulus pairs constitute a potency equivalence function, which describes the shape of the relationship between equipotent positive and negative stimulus magnitudes."
"Anson, Jennifer R.; Dickman, Chris R.; Boonstra, Rudy; Jessop, Tim S.",Stress Triangle: Do Introduced Predators Exert Indirect Costs on Native Predators and Prey?,PLoS ONE,8,e60916,e60916,,2013,"Non-consumptive effects of predators on each other and on prey populations often exceed the effects of direct predation. These effects can arise from fear responses elevating glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels (predator stress hypothesis) or from increased vigilance that reduces foraging efficiency and body condition (predator sensitive foraging hypothesis); both responses can lead to immunosuppression and increased parasite loads. Non-consumptive effects of invasive predators have been little studied, even though their direct impacts on local species are usually greater than those of their native counterparts. To address this issue, we explored the non-consumptive effects of the invasive red fox Vulpes vulpes on two native species in eastern Australia: a reptilian predator, the lace monitor Varanus varius and a marsupial, the ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus. In particular, we tested predictions derived from the above two hypotheses by comparing the basal glucocorticoid levels, foraging behaviour, body condition and haemoparasite loads of both native species in areas with and without fox suppression. Lace monitors showed no GC response or differences in haemoparasite loads but were more likely to trade safety for higher food rewards, and had higher body condition, in areas of fox suppression than in areas where foxes remained abundant. In contrast, ringtails showed no physiological or behavioural differences between fox-suppressed and control areas. Predator sensitive foraging is a non-consumptive cost for lace monitors in the presence of the fox and most likely represents a response to competition. The ringtail's lack of response to the fox potentially represents complete naivete or strong and rapid selection to the invasive predator. We suggest evolutionary responses are often overlooked in interactions between native and introduced species, but must be incorporated if we are to understand the suite of forces that shape community assembly and function in the wake of biological invasions."

We analyse habitat selection and grouping behaviour (group size and cohesion) of lesser rhea (Rhea pennatasubsp.pennata), a ratite endemic of South America inhabiting steppe shrublands and grasslands, in relation to actual (puma probability of occurrence) and perceived (habitat structure: openness, visibility) predation risk, co-occurrence with other herbivore species and forage availability in the Chilean Patagonia. We used data from 9 sampling seasons in 5 years. Results show that habitat selection, group size and cohesion in lesser rhea were mainly driven by variables associated with perceived predation risk and by co-occurrence with other herbivores both during breeding and non-breeding season. As expected, lesser rhea preferred open habitats (vegas and grasslands) that allow a behaviour of 'watch and run' to avoid predation and formed larger groups in them. Moreover, lesser rhea positively selected year-round habitats where livestock occur, forming large groups during non-breeding season there. Group size and co-occurrence with other herbivores significantly decreased group cohesion, suggesting a reduction of perceived predation risk. Therefore, lesser rhea seems to take advantage of forming mixed interspecific groups to reduce predation risk. These results suggest that lesser rhea habitat selection and grouping behaviour are preferentially driven by factors related to perceived predation risk than by actual predator occurrence or food availability."

Since finite attention can result in negative correlations between foraging and vigilance, the tendency of individual predators to focus attention on searching for cryptic prey may be correlated with other behavioural traits which reflect risk-reward trade-offs, such as consistent inter-individual variation in boldness (a personality trait describing risk-taking, defined in this study as the time taken to leave a refuge). We investigated the importance of personality in prey detection by comparing inter-individual variation in the response of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to conspicuous and cryptic prey. Fish were slower to attack cryptic prey than conspicuous prey, consistent with cryptic prey being harder to detect. Despite the greater challenge involved in detecting cryptic prey, inter-individual variation in the time taken to detect prey was similar in the cryptic and conspicuous prey treatments, and was uncorrelated with boldness, which was repeatable between individuals. We also observed a positive association between the rate of attack on conspicuous prey and whether individual fish attacked cryptic prey in other trials. Our findings suggest that boldness is not related to prey detection or attention in this context. Instead, consistent differences in motivation once exploration has begun between individual predators may explain inter-individual variation in the time taken to attack both prey cryptic and conspicuous prey. Significance statement Using an experimental approach to manipulate the conspicuousness of prey, we show that individual fish consistently differ in their rates of attacking prey. This demonstrates that fish show personality variation in predatory behaviour, but these inter-individual differences were not related to the boldness of each fish (their tendency to engage in risky behaviours)."

Here, we use the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) as a model organism to investigate the effect of nest density on chicks' growth rate and survival. On Appledore Island, Maine, Herring Gulls nest both in dense subcolonies and in more isolated situations, affording a unique opportunity for comparison of reproductive success of pairs nesting in both contexts on the same island. Chicks reared in dense subcolonies grew at a rate significantly higher than that of those reared in more isolated settings. Using mark recapture analysis, we found that a chick's expected survival is dependent on hatch weight, hatch date, hatch order, and context (nest in dense or loose subcolony). The first chick to hatch in each nest had a significantly greater probability of surviving to fledging than the last-hatched chick. Last-hatched chicks had a significantly greater chance of survival from hatching to fledging if they were hatched and reared in the dense subcolony than in the loose subcolony. Further research is required to distinguish among the effects of parents' quality and age (and thus their ability to defend young and provide food), agonistic behavioral interactions, and proximity to nesting Great Black-backed Gulls (L. marinus, the main predator of Herring Gull chicks), on these differences. Our results suggest that pairs nesting in dense subcolonies benefit through chicks' greater growth rate and survival, possibly due to increased vigilance or greater access to food."

Why the turquoise-browed motmot wags its tail before feeding nestlings,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,73,965,970,10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.10.020,2007,"Both sexes of the turquoise-browed motmot, Eumomota superciliosa, display their long-racketed tail in an exaggerated side-to-side wag display in two contexts. In the. rst, the wag display is performed in the presence of predators (predator-elicited wag display), and evidence supports the hypothesis that the signal functions as a pursuit-deterrent signal (Murphy 2006, Behavioral Ecology, 17, 547-553). In the second, the wag display is performed in the apparent absence of predators immediately before feeding nestlings ( prefeeding wag display). I tested four hypotheses on the adaptive significance of the prefeeding wag display: ( 1) a dishonest, preemptive, pursuit-deterrent signal given in case predators are present; ( 2) a nonfunctional mis. re of the predator-elicited wag display; ( 3) a signal that alerts nestlings to the delivery of food; ( 4) a sexually selected signal that advertises parental quality to potential mates. There was no support for the hypotheses that the prefeeding wag display was directed to nestlings or potential mates. The wag display was generally performed where nestlings could not detect the signal and the display did not vary with the sex of the displaying bird, the presence of the mate, or the size of the food carried in the signaller's bill. Evidence presented in this paper is most consistent with the hypothesis that the predator-elicited wag display and the prefeeding wag display are performed as a response to the presence or the potential presence of a predator. I discuss the possibility that the prefeeding wag display functions as a dishonest, pursuit-deterrent signal. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We generally assume that captive-born animals may lose their antipredator behaviour abilities in captivity, but studies rarely compare predator recognition abilities of captive-born and wild-captured animals to test this. To identify whether predator discrimination abilities of the critically endangered Vancouver Island marmots Marmota vancouverensis were lost in captivity, we presented wild-captured and captive-born marmots with taxidermic mounts of predators (a cougar Felis concolor and wolf Canis lupus) together with control stimuli (marmot, domestic goat Capra aegagrus, the cart on which all stimuli were presented and a 'blank' no-stimulus control). Regardless of specific predator discrimination abilities, for some species overall 'personality' may be associated with response to predators and subsequent survival. Thus, to quantify overall reactivity in the presence of a predator, we also conducted a mirror-image stimulus (MIS) presentation experiment where marmots were video-recorded with or without the presence of a wolf. Marmots discriminated among these stimuli, responding the most to the wolf and cougar. The MIS results suggest that marmots varied along a continuum of reactivity. The amount of reactivity was unaffected by the presence of a wolf, and was correlated with our highest level of responsiveness (vigilance at the burrow and time within the burrow) to the wolf. Taken together, we conclude that marmots differentiate predators from non-predators and that this ability has not been lost under the conditions in which they have been reared."

This eavesdropping is an important way to acquire information regarding predator location and threat magnitude. Previous studies have investigated lizards eavesdropping on predators, while others have studied lizards eavesdropping on alarm calls. Studies that examine lizard responses to playbacks of both predatory calls and heterospecific alarm calls are absent, even though eavesdropping may be especially important in nonvocal species. By comparing both types of calls, we can assess their relative importance to skinks and understand how skinks discriminate between these calls. We broadcast sympatric predator vocalizations and both alarm call and nonalarm social vocalizations from a nonpredatory bird (red-vented bulbul, Pycnonotus cafer) to determine whether nonvocal, white-bellied copper-striped skinks could discriminate among them. Upon hearing red-vented bulbul alarm calls, white-bellied copper-striped skinks reduced their rate of looking and increased their rate of bloating compared to a baseline period. However, they did not respond significantly to red-vented bulbul social calls or to vocalizations from potential predators. Our study is the first to look at the relative magnitude of response to playbacks of predator and heterospecific vocalizations in lizards. White-bellied copper-striped skinks most likely depend on heterospecific vocalizations for predator information because they are nonvocal and found low on the forest floor, making it harder for them to identify predators directly than through alarm calls of avian heterospecifics.

Fear of humans has been proposed to act as a substitute, but new research identifies humans as a super predator globally far more lethal to mesocarnivores, and thus presumably far more frightening. Although much of the world now consists of human-dominated landscapes, there remains relatively little research regarding how behavioral responses to humans affect trophic networks, to the extent that no study has yet experimentally tested the relative fearfulness mesocarnivores demonstrate in reaction to humans versus nonhuman predators. Badgers (Meles meles) in Britain are a model mesocarnivore insofar as they no longer need fear native large carnivores (bears, Ursus arctos; wolves, Canis lupus) and now perhaps fear humans more. We tested the fearfulness badgers demonstrated to audio playbacks of extant (dog) and extinct (bear and wolf) large carnivores, and humans, by assaying the suppression of foraging behavior. Hearing humans affected latency to feed, vigilance, foraging time, number of feeding visits, and number of badgers feeding. Hearing dogs and bears had far lesser effects on latency to feed, and hearing wolves had no effects. Our results indicate fear of humans evidently cannot substitute for the fear large carnivores inspire in mesocarnivores because humans are perceived as far more frightening, which we discuss in light of the recovery of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes."
"Hamel, S.; Cote, S. D.",Habitat use patterns in relation to escape terrain: are alpine ungulate females trading off better foraging sites for safety?,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,85,933,943,10.1139/Z07-080,2007,"Predation risk often forces prey to trade off good foraging sites for safety, and compromises are expected to be greater in females with vulnerable offspring than in barren females. To determine whether adult females of large herbivores traded off forage for safety, we assessed habitat use and estimated vegetation abundance and quality in relation to distance to escape terrain in marked mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus de Blainville, 1816). We found that all females spent more time foraging near escape terrain than away from them. Females with young foraged on average 20 m closer to escape terrain than barren females in June, a time when offspring were particularly vulnerable to predation. Plant biomass did not vary with distance to escape terrain in June, but was lower closer than away from escape terrain during all other months. The abundance of forbs and shrubs increased with distance to escape terrain, but their quality did not vary. For grasses and sedges, plant digestible content decreased closer to escape terrain, but interestingly proteins increased. Our results suggest that females traded off forage abundance, and to a lesser extent forage quality, for safety. Compared with barren females, females with offspring may face a trade-off in plant digestible content by foraging in safer areas than barren females."

We studied the habitat use of pin-tailed sandgrouses Pterocles alchata and their association with another vulnerable species, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax in agrarian pseudo-steppes of central Spain using radio-tracking. The occurrence of mixed-species flocks varied seasonally, being more frequent in winter (65% of pin-tailed sandgrouse flocks). In this season, pin-tailed sandgrouses preferred stubble fields and fallows. Moreover, we found that habitat selection of pin-tailed sandgrouse depended on the association with little bustards in mixed-species flocks. When in mixed-species groups, sandgrouses changed their agrarian substrate preferences, and used stubble fields significantly more often than when in sandgrouse-only flocks. We also provide evidence that pin-tailed sandgrouse benefited from the anti-predator vigilance of little bustards, allowing sandgrouse to exploit new feeding grounds (stubble fields) that would otherwise be too risky to exploit. Our results indicate a close positive association between these two species, which are both declining in Europe, and we discuss implications for their management and conservation. We also recommend taking into account inter-specific positive interactions when designing conservation strategies for threatened species."

Analysis of these time budgets were used to quantify and compare the behavior of females, mates and broods during incubation, hatching and brood-rearing. Male behavior changed little during the breeding season; however, they fed less and were alert more during hatching than during either incubation or brood-rearing. Females interrupted incubation sessions only to feed and occasionally to assist males in chasing intruding swans. Females initiated recesses during incubation usually when males were near the nest. Males attended nests during their mates' absence, but were never observed to sit on the eggs. During brood-rearing, behavior of females and males was similar, but cygnets spent more time feeding and resting, and less time preening and being alert, than did parents. Activity budgets are compared to those from other studies of wild Trumpeter Swans and Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) in Alaska."

Behaviours that facilitate successful escape are therefore under strong selection, but anti-predator skills often emerge gradually during an individual's early development. Using long-term data and acoustic recordings of alarm calls collected during natural predator encounters, we aimed to elucidate two largely unsolved issues in anti-predator ontogeny: (1) whether incorrect predator assignment is adaptively age-appropriate, given that vulnerability often changes during development, or whether age-related differences reflect true mistakes made by immature individuals; and (2) the extent to which the development of adult-like competence in alarm-call production and usage is simply a function of maturational processes or dependent upon experience. We found that young meerkats (Suricata suricatta) were less likely to give alarm calls than adults, but alarmed more in response to non-threatening species compared to adults. However, stimuli that pose a greater threat to young than adults did not elicit more calling from young; this argues against age-related changes in vulnerability as the sole explanation for developmental changes in calling. Young in small groups, who were more likely to watch out for predators, alarmed more than less vigilant young in larger groups. Moreover, despite similarities in acoustic structure between alarm call types, calls appeared in the repertoire at different rates, and those that were associated with frequently encountered predators were produced relatively early on. These results indicate that experience is a more plausible explanation for such developmental trajectories than maturation."

Thus, when disturbed, animal responses are likely to follow the same economic principles used by prey when encountering predators. We simulated predator attacks with different characteristics and in different situations to study the factors that determine the escape response of 1-year-old chinstrap penguins. The results indicate that 1-year-old penguins adjusted their escape behaviour according to the level of risk posed by the researcher acting as a potential predator. When 1-year-old penguins were close to a breeding subcolony, they started to escape later, and fled shorter distances, at lower speeds, and not fleeing directly into the subcolony. This contrasts with their fleeing behaviour far from subcolonies, when penguins fled sooner, for longer, and faster, and in a direction that maximized the distance between themselves and the experimenter, by fleeing directly away from the experimenter. This might suggest the existence of a trade-off between fleeing from the predator and avoiding entering the subcolony where 1-year-old penguins will receive aggressive responses from breeding adults. The type of approach was not important in deciding when to flee. However, penguins did escape for longer distances and faster when approached directly, showing that penguins were able to assess risk level based on predator behaviour. Our findings may have implications for management of penguin colonies visited by tourists. The delimitation of buffer areas and advice on how tourists should behave when approaching penguins might arise from studies of the factors that affect risk assessment of penguins."

Eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, nurse their young for at least 18 months, allowing for a strong bond to develop between mothers and young. Because most female kangaroos are philopatric, the mother-offspring relationship established during lactation could persist into adulthood, resulting in clusters of female kin. Strong social bonds, however, are based on affiliative behaviours and frequent interactions. In particular, one might not expect strong bonds among related individuals unless there are advantages to interacting with relatives compared to associating with unrelated conspecifics. We examined development of the mother-offspring relationship in eastern grey kangaroos from permanent emergence from the pouch to the time of weaning. We studied a high-density population at Wilsons Promontory National Park, Victoria, Australia. There were few differences in the behaviour of sons and daughters towards mothers. However, daughters foraged slightly closer than sons to their mothers and daughters were weaned approximately 2 months later than sons if the mother did not have a surviving large pouch young. Mothers associated more closely with their daughters than their sons when offspring were aged 10-29 months but neither sex associated closely with their mothers beyond 33 months of age. Mothers never intervened to defend their young from aggressive individuals and it was the offspring that maintained spatial proximity to their mothers. Kangaroo mothers had few interactions with their juvenile offspring other than nursing. Females may be philopatric and settle near close kin as adults but kangaroos appear to have few of those early affiliative interactions necessary for social bonds to develop.

We developed a machine vision-based framework to classify driver's gaze into context rich zones of interest andmodel driver's gaze behavior by representing gaze dynamics over a time period using gaze accumulation, glance duration, and glance frequencies. As a use case, we explore the driver's gaze dynamic patterns during maneuvers executed in freeway driving, namely, left lane change maneuver, right lane change maneuver, and lane keeping. It is shown that condensing gaze dynamics into durations and frequencies leads to recurring patterns based on driver activities. Furthermore, modeling these patterns show predictive powers in maneuver detection up to a few hundred milliseconds a priori."

In Portugal's main wintering site, time budget and flock dynamics of the Common Crane were studied in the winter periods 1994-1995 and 1995-1996, the last two years of a long drought period. Visits were made every two weeks from November to March. The behaviour of Cranes was recorded by 3 min focal animal sampling in every daylight hour. Flock size, % of juveniles and distance to nearest roost were recorded. Time budget was determined by energetic requirements. Daily activity was characterised by a constant high feeding effort during most of the day with only a small decrease from 2.00 to 4.00 p.m.: this difference to the classical double-peak pattern of feeding effort could be a result of the low food availability. Preening occupied discrete periods where no feeding occurred. Vigilance effort was constant during the day. In the morning, when feeding activity was maximal, a peak in preening bouts suggested interindividual differences in time budgets. This difference could be a result of competition and reflect the existence of dominance-subordinate relations in wintering cranes. Cranes dispersed more during the morning, aggregating in larger flocks closer to the roost during the afternoon. In general, flock dynamics seemed related to distribution of food resources, with a weak tendency for segregation of the families from the non-reproductive individuals."

We conducted 11 month of observations on glance rates in a captive group of 15 mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx). We investigated the factors affecting inter- and intraindividual variation in the attention paid to group mates. The total amount of attention given to group mates was related to the age, but not to the sex or the dominance rank of the subject. Mandrills looked more at high-ranking than at low-ranking group mates and more at their own kin than at nonkin. Furthermore, the attention directed to both the aggressor and its victim increased markedly after an aggressive episode. These results show mandrills actively monitor their group mates, thus presumably gaining valuable social information, and suggest that studying patterns of social attention may help to understand primate social knowledge and decision making."

In addition to reproductive skew, group members may also exhibit social skew, where some individuals show particular behaviors more often than others. Significant social skew in behaviors such as anti-predator defense or social interactions may influence survival and reproduction. Therefore, social skew has the potential to translate into reproductive skew and affect group productivity. We measured social skew across groups in a population of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). Several behaviors such as agonistic interactions, affiliative interactions, and first emergence were significantly skewed in most groups. Alarm calling, however, was infrequently skewed more than would be expected by random chance. Thus, marmot groups do not appear to have behavioral roles in terms of individuals acting like sentinels. Although significant social skew was present, it did not obviously affect fitness as measured by female reproductive success for each group. However, skew in individual-directed behavior (e.g. agonistic and affiliative interactions) did significantly correlate with the level of reproductive skew. Finally, the results were independent of the scale at which groups were defined. Behavioral variability appears to occur similarly across the entire marmot population. The results of this study illustrate that the quantification of social skew has potential to be a powerful tool for understanding the evolution of sociality."

In this study, we investigated the diet composition of violet-green swallow nestlings to document the consumption of food resources by offspring during adult feeding visits. We identified arthropods from 13 taxonomic orders in feeding boluses and found that representation of taxonomic groups was highly uneven and dominated by Diptera and Hemiptera. Although swallows did provision some large prey, the great majority (i.e., 92.6% of 1047) of food items were <5 mm in length. Feeding boluses collected from the congeneric tree swallow (T. bicolor) at the same study area and during the same time period revealed similar patterns of size and taxonomic representation of diet composition of violet-green nestlings, raising questions as to how these species partition critical resources in areas of sympatry."

The direct costs of infection may include nutritional deficiencies, which reduce body condition over time, and result in the hosts modifying their foraging behaviour to compensate for any losses. Allenby's gerbils are commonly infected with the Mycoplasma haemomuris-like bacteria, which may induce choline (essential vitamin) and arginine (amino acid) deficiencies. Gerbils should therefore alter their behaviour to make up for any shortfalls in nutrient production and retention. We tested two predictions. 1) infected gerbils would compensate for nutrient losses by spending more time foraging in patches, including, during riskier periods of owl presence, and in riskier open microhabitats. Furthermore, infected gerbils would preferentially forage from patches supplemented with choline and arginine enriched food over control food. 2) Alternatively, if infection did not create a nutrient deficiency, then infected individuals would display a similar pattern of patch use to uninfected individuals, and harvest similar amounts of food from supplemented and control patches. Our findings supported the second prediction. There was no observed difference in foraging behaviour between infected and uninfected individuals. Moreover, infected gerbils did not selectively forage more intensively from food patches enriched with either choline or arginine seed over the control patches. These results suggest that this bacteria-gerbil interaction does not result in a nutrient deficiency as observed for other Mycoplasma-rodent systems."

Here we focused on addax (Addax nasomaculatus), a Critically Endangered antelope species, in the Jbil National Park, Tunisia. In this study, we advanced the hypothesis that season, day period, sex and social structure have an effect on the activity budgets and diet composition of addax. Three groups were selected (large group, adult pair and solitary male). Resting, moving, grazing, vigilance and other behaviours were recorded during two seasons (dry and wet) and in the morning and the afternoon. In addition, faecal samples were collected. The results indicate that season and day period were the main factors affecting the activity budgets. The resting behaviour increased from the wet to the dry season, and from morning to afternoon. The grazing and moving behaviours increased during the wet season and decreased from morning to afternoon. Addax select a mixed diet composed of perennial and herbaceous plant species notably during the wet season. In addition, we observed that addax modify their behaviour according to the season and forage availability. This represents an adaptive strategy to survive in a desert climate with a stochastic low-resource environment and depending on ambient climatic conditions."

One line of research has successfully demonstrated that innovation can represent a stable individual trait, but by the same token has shown strong contextual effects on innovation. We examined the effects of social context on innovative foraging behaviour. Across two separate experiments, we measured the individual propensity of Indian mynahs, Acridotheres tristis, to innovate when alone, in pairs, or in groups of five birds. Although innovators remained consistent in their relative innovation performance ranking (high, medium, low), the presence of one or more conspecifics reduced the likelihood of innovating, and increased innovation latencies, significantly relative to when individuals were tested alone. A neophobia test in which latency to forage was compared in both the absence and the presence of a novel object, in each of two social contexts (solitary versus social), showed that the presence of conspecifics caused mynahs to forage significantly faster in a safe situation (object absent) relative to when alone, but to delay foraging in a risky situation (object present). Together, these findings suggest that sociality can have contrasting effects on foraging in safe and risky situations, and, in some species at least, effects of sociality on innovative foraging may hence be more akin to those observed in the presence of risk. Negotiation over engaging with risks inherent to innovative foraging offered the most likely explanation for socially inhibited innovation behaviour, and may act to constrain the diffusion of innovations under some conditions.

Predation is an important driver of extrinsic mortality and mobile animals form groups in response to increased predation risk. Furthermore, in many species juveniles suffer higher mortality than older individuals, which may reflect a lower phenotypic quality, lower competitiveness, or a lack of antipredator or foraging skills. Here we assessed the causes of mortality for 371 radio tagged Siberian jays. This sedentary bird species lives in family groups that contain a breeding pair as well as related and unrelated non-breeders. Ninety-five percent of death were due to predation (n = 59 out of 62 individuals) and most individuals were killed by Accipiter hawks. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models showed that non-breeders had a lower survival than breeders, but only in territories in managed forest with little visual cover. Examining breeders, only sex influenced survival with males having a lower survival than females. For non-breeders, juveniles had lower survival than older non-breeders, and those on managed territories had lower survival than those on unmanaged territories. Additionally, a low feather quality reduced the survival probability of non-breeders only. Thus, living on managed territories and having a low feature quality affected only non-breeders, particularly juveniles. These findings add to previous research demonstrating that juvenile Siberian jays acquire critical antipredator skills from experienced group members. Thus, experience can buffer extrinsic mortality, highlighting that group living not only provides safety in numbers, but also provide social opportunities to learn critical life-skills."

Consequently, management of habituated animals is typically invasive and often includes translocation of these animals to remote areas and sometimes even their destruction. Techniques to prevent or reverse habituation and other forms of in situ management are necessary to balance ecological and social requirements, but they have received very little experimental attention to date. This study compared the efficacy of two aversive conditioning treatments that used either humans or dogs to create sequences resembling chases by predators, which, along with a control category, were repeatedly and individually applied to 24 moderately habituated, radio-collared elk in Banff National Park during the winter of 2001-2002. Three response variables were measured before and after treatment. Relative to untreated animals, the distance at which elk fled from approaching humans, i.e., the flight response distance, increased following both human and dog treatments, but there was no difference between the two treatments. The proportion of time spent in vigilance postures decreased for all treatment groups, without differences among groups, suggesting that this behavior responded mainly to seasonal effects. The average distance between elk locations and the town boundary, measured once daily by telemetry, significantly increased for human-conditioned elk. One of the co-variates we measured, wolf activity, exerted counteracting effects on conditioning effects; flight response distances and proximity to the town site were both lower when wolf activity was high. This research demonstrates that it is possible to temporarily modify aspects of the behavior of moderately habituated elk using aversive conditioning, suggests a method for reducing habituation in the first place, and provides a solution for Banff and other jurisdictions to manage hyperabundant and habituated urban wildlife."

In this study, we evaluated the relative contribution of information held by the population majority versus new immigrants to groups in determining group function. To do so, we created experimental groups of the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola that were either iteratively exposed to a dangerous predator, the ant Anoplopepis custodiens, or kept in safety. We then seeded these groups (i.e., the population majority) with an immigrant individual that either had or did not have prior experience with the predator and was either shy or bold. Bold group members are argued to be particularly influential for group function in S. dumicola. We then evaluated colonies' response towards predators over multiple trials to determine the effect of the immigrant's and the majority's prior experience with the predator and the immigrant's boldness. We found that groups adopt a better safe than sorry strategy, where groups avoided predators when either the group or the immigrant had been previously exposed to risk, regardless of immigrant boldness. These findings suggest that past experience with predators, even if only experienced by a single individual in the group, can alter how groups respond to risk in a potentially advantageous manner."

In early winter, the percentage of individuals aggregated in the largest groups was highest in the clearings, while in late winter, the percentage of individuals observed in the largest groups was highest in the closed woodland. Besides, the percentage of large groups observed in the morning and evening (when most of deer are active) was much higher than during daytime (when level of deer activity is lower). Changes in food availability are suggested to be a factor responsible for variation in sika deer group size in different habitats."

Facing the presence of predators' cues, preys have developed a series of anti-predatory behaviors that involve trade-offs between costs and benefits. Faced with the clear advantage of reducing the immediate risk of predation, preys are forced to modify their performance in other activities. The most documented of them is undoubtedly the foraging. In the presence of predators or their cues in the environment, a compromise between food and safety arises, so that the prey restricts the time searching for food, limits it to protected sites, or increase the vigilance, thus impacting foraging success and consequently in reproductive performance and long-term survival. However, the influence of several factors, like nutritional condition (fed or food deprived) or predator experience, on preys' feeding choices has been comparatively less studied. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate Ctenomys talarum's feeding behavior under the presence of predator cues (cat urine) considering (1) their nutritional condition and (2) a recent experience of a failed predatory event. The results of this work show that tuco-tucos can distinguish cues indicative of the presence of a predator and prefer to feed in areas where predator cues are not present (safe sites). Also, recent predatory experiences influenced foraging decisions, increasing the time without activity previous to a new feeding excursion. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the importance of the perception of predatory risk in the foraging behavior of C. talarum."
"Willisch, Christian S.; Ingold, Paul",Feeding or resting? The strategy of rutting male Alpine chamois,ETHOLOGY,113,97,104,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01301.x,2007,"Optimal foraging theory suggests that animals normally maximize energy intake to optimize their energy balance. However, when efficiency to assimilate energy falls below the level necessary to ascertain basal energetic requirements, they should shift to an energy saving strategy. Males of many ruminant species considerably reduce their food intake during the rut. Nevertheless, they are commonly assumed to maximize energy intake besides their investments in rutting activities. Based on predictions of optimal foraging theory and the specific ruminant digestive physiology, we propose, however, that rutting males in polygynous species with time consuming mating tactics should instead use an energy saving strategy. Particularly, we predict this to be the case in Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra), a highly polygynous mountain ungulate, of which the males defend mating territories during the rut. By combining observational and telemetry data of eight radio-collared males we constructed individual 24-h time budgets, and compared the behavior of males before, during and after the rut. Males spent significantly less time feeding during the rut (0.9 h) compared with before (8.5 h) and afterwards (6.4 and 7.5 h, respectively), whereas time spent lying remained more or less unchanged (pre-rut; 12.7 h, rut; 13.3 h, post-rut; 12.9 and 13.9 h, respectively). The ratio of time spent feeding to lying dropped from 0.67 in the pre-rut period to 0.05 in the rutting period. As a result, males allocated on average approx. 90% of their non-rutting time to lying, and a negative relationship between rutting and lying time emerged. Hence, males seemed to trade lying time against rutting time. We conclude from these results that male Alpine chamois do not maximize their energy intake during the rut, but rather adopt an energy saving strategy to optimize their energy balance."

In the dry season and in clear weather in the wet season the wallabies were essentially nocturnal, foraging throughout the night in open areas and resting during the day in monsoon rainforest patches. The day was clearly partitioned into active and inactive periods, with activity coordination ( behaviour synchrony) being high during the night and day and low in the transition between these foraging and resting periods. In overcast weather activity coordination was lower throughout the day. The day was not partitioned into active and inactive periods and the wallabies were observed foraging in the open at all times of day. However, they foraged for no longer over 24 hours than in clear weather when foraging was mainly a nocturnal activity. The wallabies spent more time foraging, moved greater distances while foraging, were less vigilant, and rested and groomed less in the dry season when forage quality was poor."

Here we quantify the independent and interactive effects of multiple concurrent changes to resources and consumers in an invaded annual grassland community in California. In a two-year study using thirty-seven 400-m(2) plots, we examine interactions among four nutrient treatments (N, P, K and micronutrients) and a keystone herbivore (pocket gopher Thomomys bottae) on four plant community outcomes: 1) plant diversity, 2) functional group composition, 3) net biomass production, an important ecosystem function, and 4) infection risk by a group of viral pathogens shared by crop and non-crop grasses (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses), an important regulating ecosystem service. We found that grassland biodiversity and infection risk were controlled by nutrient identity and supply ratio whereas nutrients interacted strongly with consumers to control grassland composition and net primary productivity. The most important insights arising from this multi-factor experiment are that net biomass production increased with phosphorus or nitrogen supply; however, when gophers were present, nitrogen caused no net effect on biomass production. In addition, infection risk was driven by phosphorus, nitrogen and micronutrient supply. Infection in a sentinel host increased strongly with the addition of micronutrients or phosphorus; however, infection declined with increasing N/P supply ratio, indicating stoichiometric control of infection risk. Finally, in spite of manipulating multiple factors, plant species richness declined with nitrogen, alone. The importance of higher-order interactions demonstrates that a multi-factor approach is critical for effective predictions in a world in which anthropogenic activities are simultaneously changing herbivore abundance and the relative supply of many nutrients."

We document the deformation history of four dormant deep-seated landslides in the Northern Apennines of Italy that were reactivated by the excavation of a double road tunnel. The tunnel is part of a larger infrastructure project that involves the improvement of the Al highway which connects Bologna and Florence. The excavation of the tunnel under the landslides' basal shear surfaces started in 2011, and with the advance of the tunnel front, deformation began to occur, causing damages to homes and infrastructures. The tunnel passes under the small villages of Ripoli and Santa Maria Maddalena. The deformation slowed down after the tunnel was completed in November 2014, and low surface displacement rates were registered for the period between October 2014 and June 2016. We show the results of an InSAR analysis designed to measure surface movements between 2003 and 2016. The InSAR displacements are derived from the Envisat, COSMO SkyMed, and Sentinel 1 datasets and cover the main construction phase of the tunnel (2011-2015). A detailed geological and geomorphological mapping of the slope is developed based on the field evidence and on the spatial pattern of surface deformation provided by our InSAR analysis. Together with the map, a new conceptual geological model of the slope in tectonically sheared and weathered flysch is presented. The satellite InSAR data show good agreement with available ground based monitoring data that include inclinometer and GPS-measurements, while small differences occur with respect to deformation time series obtained from a ground -based InSAR instrument. In particular, the InSAR results for the X -Band data of COSMO SkyMed demonstrate the close relationship between the position of the excavation front and the displacement rates of previously dormant landslide deposits. Conversely, the concurrent rainfall does not appear to significantly influence the observed behavior and, if any, had only a minor influence on the displacement history of the investigated landslides."

Surprisingly, little is known on the effects of an individual left alone in a highly familiar place, compared to novel-environment isolation. Therefore, using stable heterosexual pairs of adult marmosets (Callithrix penicillata), we assessed in the individual left behind in the home-cage: (1) the behavior during and after a 5 and 15 min separation; (2) the behavior and cortisol levels before, during and after a 7-day separation; and (3) the relationship between these two components of the stress response. All conditions induced social contact calls and hyperlocomotion, with prolonged separation yielding a habituation effect (p < 0.05). How each parameter returned to baseline following the reunion depended on the duration of the preceding separation interval, with post-reunion affiliative behaviors increasing significantly only after longer intervals (experiment 1: p = 0.02; experiment 2: p = 0.001). Cortisol concentrations, which also increased during the 7-day separation (p = 0.04), were temporally dissociated from and not correlated with the marmosets' behavioral response (p > 0.05). Interestingly, cortisol levels during the social separation phase were negatively correlated with post-reunion affiliative behavior (p = 0.05). Stress-induced cortisol may thus hinder putative behavioral coping strategies. However, post-reunion affiliative behavior was not correlated with the last cortisol measure (p = 0.21), Therefore, social disruption in a familiar environment - even if brief - induces stress-related responses and behavioral coping strategies. These findings bear important implication for captive management and research protocols ming marmosets."

Sentinel codling moth eggs laid by caged moths on 10 shoots in each orchard were scored as alive, dead, or missing after 7 d, and beating tray samples of arthropod predators were collected at the beginning and end of each trial. Levels of egg predation (dead + missing eggs) did not differ significantly among orchard types in June but varied among orchard types in August (MD alone > NO + OPs > OPs). The percentage of dead eggs in August was significantly higher in the orchards receiving only MD than in orchards treated only with OPs. The percentage of missing eggs was significantly lower both months in orchards not treated with MD. Densities of spiders and all predators on both sample dates and for earwigs in August were significantly higher in orchards not treated with OPs. Densities of heteropteran predators did not vary significantly by orchard type. No significant correlations were found among predator densities and egg mortality within an orchard type. However, the percentages of dead eggs and dead plus missing eggs were significantly and positively correlated with densities of earwigs, spiders, and all predators in tray samples across the 16 orchards."

Numerous reviews on drones tout almost unlimited potential within the wildlife sciences as they open up inaccessible habitats to observation. However, the influence of drones on the animals themselves is far less understood, and impact studies to construct protocols for best practices are urgently needed to minimise the potential for stress on target species. The impact of a quadcopter drone's approach speed, angle of approach and initial starting altitude was tested on the behavioural responses of African elephants (Loxodonta africana), along with sustained speed and flight pattern. Seventy-nine approach flights and 70 presence flights were conducted. The speed and angle of approach significantly impacted the success of a flight, but neither speed nor flight pattern had any measurable impact on elephants' behaviour during sustained flights. It is recommended that drones be launched at a distance of 100 m from an elephant or a herd of elephants, ascending to a height of 50 m by using an approach speed of 2m/s and an approach angle of 45 degrees or less to successfully contact elephant targets.Conservation implications: This study aimed to provide a significant step towards the ethical use of drones in wildlife research. Further research is required to investigate the impacts of drones on other taxa. Physiological responses to drones, for example, would determine if physiological stress responses unlinked to behavioural indicators are of concern in elephants."

Prey species can alter their behavior and space use as a response to increased predation risk, which might be traded off with energetic requirements. Thus, whether or not an anti-predator behavior is performed might depend on the perceived risk. In this study, we investigated the behavioral and spatial response of the European hare (Lepus europaeus) toward the presence of a predator scent, using red fox (Vulpes vulpes) scat, an unfamiliar control scent (butyric acid), and a true control (no scent). We collected data on hare activity times and behavior using 50 camera trap locations and spatial data using GPS telemetry (30,481 GPS positions of 12 hares). Hares showed spatial anti-predator behaviors within their home range, for example, the local avoidance of areas treated with scent and remaining further from field edges, in response to sympatric predator scent and partly also in response to unfamiliar butyric acid. Conversely, more costly anti-predator behaviors, that is, increased vigilance at the expense of foraging, were only shown in response to the predator scent. Our results suggest that prey species respond flexibly toward scent cues, utilizing less costly anti-predator behaviors independent of the perceived threat, whereas costly anti-predator responses are only used in the presence of real threat. Further, our findings emphasize that a combination of camera trap and GPS data can provide detailed information on animal behavior and space use, and caution that interpretation of one data source alone might lead to incomplete conclusions."

Consequently, maternal responsiveness to and investment in infants tends to be conditional, and especially sensitive to infant cues and signals of vigour. Since fathers do not bear the same excessive reproductive costs, their threshold to invest in a dying immature may be lower than in mothers. We present an anecdotal report of reactions of a first-time breeding pair of captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to their dying infant. We found a male bias in all interactions with the dying infant that did not show typical cues of infant vigour. These results show that the dying infant elicited more investment by the father than the mother. Because of this conditional maternal investment, infants of cooperatively breeding primates may be under selection to advertise their viability, in particular to their mothers."

Risk-taking behavior in other social mammals formed the basis for our prediction that the mere physical presence of others, absent any social interaction, would create a psychological state of security that, in turn, would promote greater risk-taking behavior. We investigated whether, why, and when the mere physical presence of others affects risk-taking behaviors in three contexts: acceptance of greater financial volatility, attitudes toward risky gambles, and actual gambling behaviors. Results indicate that people in the mere physical presence of others make riskier decisions than people making identical decisions alone, and that feelings of security were the psychological mechanism behind this effect. Our results also suggest that the effect is contingent on whether people are surrounded by others who belong to the same social group. A meta-analysis across all studies presented in this research reveals a highly reliable mere-presence effect. Together, these results demonstrate that the mere physical presence of others can have a potent impact on risk-taking behaviors. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Lima, Steven L.; Lee, Jong Koo",Is social coordination during escape flights a general phenomenon in birds?,ETHOLOGY,126,40,50,10.1111/eth.12958,2020,"Escape from predatory attack as a socially coordinated group is observed in many social animals, including birds, especially those in more open habitats where the group itself may be the only source of protection from an attacking predator. For many social birds, however, woody vegetative cover is the main refuge from attack, but such birds might nevertheless benefit from social coordination during escape flights to cover. Such benefits could reflect the confusion effect, selfish herd effect, or the simple dilution of risk. We examined this possibility of coordinated escape in mixed flocks of wintering passerellid sparrows (Passerellidae). These free-living birds fed in a patch of food flanked on opposite sides by two refuges composed of woody cover. Under such conditions, coordination in escape behavior should be expressed as a tendency to escape together as a group to the same cover location. Such behavior, however, was not the rule. During spontaneous flushes to cover, a group of escaping birds stayed together only when one cover location was clearly closer than the other. With cover equidistant from the food patch, escaping flocks tended to split about evenly between cover locations. Birds in close proximity prior to an escape flight did not show enhanced escape coordination, nor did those feeding at significant distances from protective cover. Evidence of escape coordination was observed in small groups (two-four birds), but even in such groups, flock splitting during escape was generally the rule. Flock splitting during attacks might reflect some sort of strategic decision-making process that lessens the risk of capture, but the most parsimonious explanation is that (all else equal) birds head for the nearest refuge, largely irrespective of the behavior of their flockmates. Our results thus provide little evidence of flock-wide social coordination during escape flights in cover-dependent birds."

C.",Behavioural syndromes predict loss of migration in wild elk,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,115,35,46,10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.02.007,2016,"Despite rapid growth in the literature on personality in wild animals, personality has seldom been explored as a tool for wildlife management in human-altered landscapes. That context frequently involves the habituation of wildlife to people, which can alter predator-prey relationships, contribute to ecosystem damage and result in human-wildlife conflict. For many ungulate species, habituation is also associated with changes to facultative behaviours, such as migration, which may also be related to individual variation. We studied these relationships by identifying behavioural types in two wild populations of elk, Cervus canadensis, within which habituation is prevalent, and in one captive population. We defined behavioural types by the relative position of each individual along a shy-bold gradient that we derived for each population from seven behavioural metrics. Those metrics included repeated measures of reactions to three stimuli (approaching humans, novel objects and novel sounds), two state variables measured with scan samples (position within herd and vigilance) and two all-occurrence records of specific behaviours (outcome of dominance interactions and herd leading). Boldness scores were more similar within than among individuals in all three populations, consistent between years, and unrelated to age. In the wild, the shyer half of each population was three times more likely to exhibit migratory behaviour, whereas the bolder half was just as likely (3: 1) to express year-round residency. Our results suggest that personality could be an important tool for managing habituated wildlife. By identifying behavioural types and their associations with particular tendencies, managers could proactively target specific individuals for behavioural modification to foster greater coexistence of people and wildlife.

To test whether male affiliative relationships were driven by reproductive and/or ecological conditions, we compared the frequency of male affiliation across the annual reproductive cycle in populations of L. catta inhabiting three habitat types found within its geographic range: (1) gallery forest at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwestern Madagascar; (2) spiny bush at Cap Sainte-Marie (CSM) in southern Madagascar; and (3) rocky-outcrop forest fragments at Anja Reserve and the Tsaranoro Valley in Madagascar's south-central highlands. Each study period spanned the gestation, lactation/migration, post-migration, and mating periods. Inter-male affiliation rates varied across reproductive periods at each of the four sites, with the highest frequencies being observed during the gestation and lactation/migration periods and the lowest frequencies occurring during the mating period. In contrast, we found no clear patterns in male female affiliation rates with respect to reproductive period. Comparing the Beza Mahafaly and CSM populations, rates of inter-male affiliation were higher at CSM during the gestation and lactation/migration periods, and rates male female affiliation were higher at CSM across all seasons except the post-migration period. We suggest that inter-male affiliative relationships in L. catta may provide beneficial social interactions (i.e., grooming, ectoparasite control, predator protection, vigilance against extra-group male agonism) when females are unavailable, particularly during male dispersal, as well as under harsh climatic conditions characteristic of some L. catta habitats."

This study assessed the impact of the translocation of an endemic New Zealand bird to a predator-free ecosanctuary on its antipredator behaviour. We compared antipredator responses of South Island robins, Petroica australis australis, found inside the ecosanctuary with those of robins inhabiting local predator-dense forests, using taxidermy models of a rat, Rattus norvegicus, and stoat, Mustela erminea. Although mammalian predators are relatively novel in New Zealand, some endemic species such as South Island robins recognize them and show antipredator behaviours. We determined the rate of loss of behaviours after release into the ecosanctuary since founders were translocated from predator-dense environments. Robins inhabiting the ecosanctuary exhibited lower intensities of antipredator behaviour towards the model rat than robins in predator-dense areas within at least 3 years after translocation, a shorter period than previously suggested. A recent stoat incursion in the sanctuary provided the opportunity to discern whether robins regained predator-specific antipredator behaviours or displayed heightened generic vigilance to all novel predators. The more intense antipredator responses recorded towards the model stoat than the model rat within the ecosanctuary indicated that the robins had regained their behaviours towards stoats but had not generalized the predatory features of the stoat to the rat. Our study raises concerns regarding the viability of sanctuary populations as sources for future translocations into areas with predators.

Ambient temperature has a relatively greater effect on the energetics of smaller species, which also generally are more vulnerable to predator attacks than are larger species. We examined variability in an index of intake rates and an index of alertness in Lesser Snow Geese Chen caerulescens caerulescens and Ross's Geese Chen rossii wintering in southwest Louisiana. Specifically we examined variation in these response variables that could be attributed to species, age, family size and ambient temperature. We hypothesized that the smaller Ross's Geese would spend relatively more time feeding, exhibit relatively higher peck rates, spend more time alert or raise their heads up from feeding more frequently, and would respond to declining temperatures by increasing their proportion of time spent feeding. As predicted, we found that Ross's Geese spent more time feeding than did Snow Geese and had slightly higher peck rates than Snow Geese in one of two winters. Ross's Geese spent more time alert than did Snow Geese in one winter, but alert rates differed by family size, independent of species, in contrast to our prediction. In one winter, time spent foraging and walking was inversely related to average daily temperature, but both varied independently of species. Effects of age and family size on time budgets were generally independent of species and in accordance with previous studies. We conclude that body size is a key variable influencing time spent feeding in Ross's Geese, which may require a high time spent feeding at the expense of other activities."

A decade after the accidental introduction of the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, in Europe, two generalist native egg parasitoids, the eupelmid Anastatus bifasciatus and the encyrtid Ooencyrtus telenomicida, have been recorded from this invasive agricultural pest in the field. Both species are able to complete development to the adult stage within the new host. Trissolcus basalis (Platygastridae = Scelionidae), which is not associated with H. halys in the field, was reared from freeze-killed sentinel eggs placed on soybean plants in central Italy. We tested in a Y-tube olfactometer the behavioural responses of these egg parasitoids to volatiles from H. halys adults and from Vicia faba plants attacked by H. halys. Both A. bifasciatus and O. telenomicida positively responded to adult H. halys male volatiles and to H. halys-induced plant volatiles, indicating ability to exploit cues associated with the new host for egg location, whereas T. basalis only reacted to female volatiles. A. bifasciatus and O. telenomicida are generalist egg parasitoids, showing a much wider host range when compared to T. basalis. On the other hand, platygastrid egg parasitoids from the native area of H. halys, considered for classical biological control, may be too risky due to the possibility of attacking nontarget species, including predaceous stink bugs. Therefore, indigenous A. bifasciatus and O. telenomicida are presently under evaluation for augmentative biological control of H. halys in Europe."

We present data on the reproductive and agonistic behaviors of a pair of captive reared Black-fronted piping guans reintroduced in a protected area in Serra da Mantiqueira, Sao Paulo state, Brazil, as well as opportunistic records of reproductive behavior of Black-fronted piping guan candidates for release that were held inside a pre-release acclimation enclosure. Behavioral data were collected from September 2017 to February 2018. We conducted 172 h of observations across 97 days of monitoring. Six reproductive behaviors were recorded: 1) Wing Display, 2) Nodding Call, 3) Mating Dance, 4) Male Offering Food to Female, 5) Tail Fanning and 6) Copulation. Two white eggs were seen on the 14th day of incubation in a natural nest built in a tree fern. Only the female was observed incubating the eggs. The female devoted over 90 % of her time to incubation, the rest mainly to foraging or vigilance. The male spent 48 % of time vigilant nearby of the nest but did not interact with the female or eggs. On the 20th day, incubation was interrupted following heavy rain. Agonistic interactions related to territory defense were observed between the released male and males inside the pre-release acclimation enclosure. On 88 % of the occasions we observed territorial defense behavior between the reintroduced male and other males inside the enclosure. The observations of the pair of reintroduced Black-fronted piping guans and of the candidates for release, provided valuable information about the reproductive behaviors of this largely unstudied and critically threatened species."

However, some populations present strategies to detect risk of predation and react to the predator. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the predation risk of Belostoma dentatum (Mayr), under the behavioral response of the red-eye tetra fish, Moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae (Steindachner), to the availability of refuge and the density of prey. We tested the hypothesis that the distance between prey and predator decreases if there is refuge and if the individual is in a group. We observed the position of M. sanctaefilomenae in relation to the water slide. In the first treatment, we added a predator; in the second, we included refuge; and in the third, we added two more fish. The occupation pattern inside the container was only detected in the presence of the predator. With the addition of the predator, the prey was restricted to the refuge. With the removal of refuges, the distance between predator and prey remained the maximum. On the other hand, when the two new individuals were added, the occupancy pattern was no longer detected, indicating the dilution effect on group behavior. These aspects indicate that in the face of the risk of predation by B. dentatum, the individual M. sanctaefilomenae may adopt different behavioral strategies, suggesting that they are able to perceive the predator and, thus, modify prey behavior. Prey are apparently interpreting environmental cues to increase chances of survival."

Peter; Barrett, Louise",Responses of vervet monkeys in large troops to terrestrial and aerial predator alarm calls,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,25,1474,1484,10.1093/beheco/aru151,2014,"The extent to which animal vocalizations convey specific information about events in the environment is subject to continued debate. The alarm-calls of vervet monkeys have played a pivotal role in this debate as they represent the classic example of a predator-specific call production system combined with a set of equally specific responses by receivers. Here, we revisit the vervet alarm-calling system, and assess the hypothesis that these acoustically distinct calls trigger context- and predator-appropriate behavior. We investigated responses in 2 groups of free-ranging vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) to both natural encounters with predators and experimental presentations of aerial and terrestrial predator alarm calls. Our results show that the modal natural and experimental response was not to initiate escape behavior, either immediately or in the 10s following an alarm call, but to look at the sound source. When monkeys did take evasive action, contextually inappropriate behavior (i.e., behavior that was not appropriate for evading the specific predator type) was as likely to occur as contextually appropriate behavior. The distance at which calls were heard was negatively correlated with the probability of evasive action. Larger group size, and the greater mean distance at which natural calls were heard, may explain why our animals displayed less predator-appropriate evasion or vigilance than expected. We conclude that the broader social and ecological framework in which calls occur, rather than a simple contextually regular linkage between call types and specific predators, shapes animals' responses to calls in this species.Classic work on vervet monkeys demonstrated that they produce predator-specific alarm-calls that produce distinctive predator avoidance responses in the monkeys that hear them. We conducted observations and vocalization playback experiments on 2 groups of vervets that live in similar habitat, but in much larger groups, to those studied originally. We show that the response to predators differs from the original study in ways that accord with this difference in group size."
"Nakagawa, N","Seasonal, sex, and interspecific differences in activity time budgets and diets of patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) and tantalus monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops tantalus), living sympatrically in Northern Cameroon",PRIMATES,41,161,174,10.1007/BF02557797,2000,"I examined seasonal, sex, and interspecific differences in activity time budgets and diets of patas (Erythrocebus patas) and sympatric tantalus monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops tantalus) on the basis of 5-day data sets collected in three and two different seasons, respectively, by the method of focal animal sampling. The seasons included species-specific mating and birth seasons. As compared with not only the birth season but also conspecific females, both patas resident male and tantalus male spent less time feeding and more time resting, day and night, in their respective mating seasons. Given that day-resting time includes time for vigilance for non-resident males and receptive females, this may reflect that males should minimize time spent feeding to allow maximum participation in other fitness-increasing activities such as mating-relating activities as SCHOENER (1971) predicted. In both species, the males consumed fruits containing less protein but more calories and showed a high feeding rate to compensate for the shorter time spent feeding in the mating season. In contrast, females consumed protein-rich food types (i.e. animals, protein-rich seeds, leaves, and flowers) in the birth season to meet the high demand for protein due to pregnancy and lactation. Given that the season for males was considered to be not a calendar but a reproductive season (i.e. mating or birth season), both sexes of patas spent more time moving and less time day- and night-resting than did the tantalus counterparts irrespective of the season. Patas subsisted on fruits, gums, and supplementarily lipid-rich seeds as an energy source and animal matters and protein-rich seeds as a protein source. In contrast, tantalus subsisted on fruits and lipid-rich seeds as energy and flowers and leaves as protein."

Here, we investigated physiological responses, which provide insights into the animal's perception of its environment. We deployed Global Positioning System (GPS)-collars in combination with cardiac biologgers on American black bears (Ursus americanus; 18 bear-years) in areas with differing road densities across Minnesota, USA. We tested whether bears exhibited acute stress responses, as defined by significant increases in heart rate (HR), associated with road crossings. Maximum HR between successive telemetry locations were, on average, 13 bpm higher when bears were known to cross a road. They crossed a road, on average, once per day. Different demographic groups (males, females with and without cubs) responded similarly. We found stronger HR responses when crossing high-traffic roads relative to low-traffic in half of the bear-year combinations we sampled. Bears crossed high-traffic roads mainly at night, but low traffic roads during daylight. Bear HRs first became elevated when 73-183 m away from roadways. Our findings suggest that roadways act as an acute stressor, but the magnitude of the stress response appears to be mild. Elevated HRs may reflect an increased vigilance and recognition of threat when preparing to cross a road. Bears' recognition and alertness to human-related threats is adaptive for living in human-altered landscapes."

Past research has suggested that both vocalisations may be contact calls, and we assessed their usage in addition to examining the effect of individual differences and social factors on male calling behaviour. We tested three hypotheses: the group cohesion, preferred companion and individual differences hypotheses. From March to July 2010, 565h of focal animal data were collected on 31 males aged 1year at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar. Focal males were observed for 30min, with vocalisations, allogrooming and agonistic interactions noted using one-zero sampling, and general behaviour, nearest neighbour identity and distance noted using instantaneous point sampling, all at 2.5min intervals. We found support for the group cohesion hypothesis for both vocalisations, and support for the preferred companion and individual differences hypotheses for the hmm but not the moan vocalisation. Moan and hmm calls maintained the distance between a male and his nearest neighbour, and were made at higher rates during behaviours which may lead to separation from conspecifics, such as travel and vigilance. Males made hmm calls at higher rates when they were low-ranking, and/or when the nearest neighbour of a male or a preferred companion of either sex. Low-ranking males may hmm call to maintain proximity to specific individuals within social groups who will show them increased tolerance, with the hmm signalling peaceful intent. Ring-tailed lemurs are one of the best living models of gregarious primate ancestors, and gaining a better knowledge of the function and range of usage of their contact calls informs our understanding of the evolution of primate cognition."

In the Puna district of Hawaii Island, E arisanus parasitized 41-72% of oriental fruit flies, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), in wild common guava, Psidium guajava L.; strawberry guava, Psidium cattleianum Sabine; and tropical almond, Tenninalia catappa L. In commercial papaya, Catica papaya L., in the same region, parasitism was only 22% in tree-collected fruit and 3% in ground-collected fruit. The low level of parasitism in papaya suggests that wild parasitoids may not track the host flies well in commercial fruit and that augmentative parasitoid releases could potentially increase parasitism and thus suppress host fly populations in this habitat. The very low parasitism in ground-collected papaya suggests that E arisanus may avoid foraging on ground fruit. Field cage experiments support this hypothesis. Numbers of females observed on tree fruit were two-fold higher than on ground fruit in small cages and 4-6-fold higher in large cages. In an experiment conducted in a papaya orchard, sentinel fruit was placed within the canopy, on the trunk, or on the ground. Parasitism was significantly higher in the canopy-placed fruit in only one of three trials. This variable response to ground fruit in the field suggests that augmentative parasitoid releases may have a significant, albeit reduced, effect on host populations under conditions of poor sanitation."
"Florou, H; Chaloulou, C",Fish as bioindicators of radiocaesium pollution in aquatic environment in Greece,FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN,6,9,15,,1997,"It is well known that selected organisms can offer an easy tool for radioactive pollution ''signal'', whereas the radiological impact of the pollution event can also be early approached by the appropriate selection of the organism-bioindicator. The nomination of an organism as bioindicator for a radionuclide is more complicated if compared with the stable isotopes even the biochemical behaviour is the same. The physical half-life of the radionuclides interferes to the ecological retention/elimination time and gives another parameter, the effective half-life, which defines the integrated activity concentration of radionuclide in the organism considered. Nevertheless, absolute activity concentration, concentration factor in relation to sea-water and the effective half-life of a radionuclide are the parameters, which can be used for the selection of organism-sentinels of radioactive pollution in aquatic ecosystems.In the present study the selection of some aquatic organisms as bioindicators for rdioacaesium (Cs-137 + Cs-134) pollution warning in marine and freshwater environment in Greece are evaluated, in relation to the ecological and the radiological impact assessment, as well, based on a bulk of activity concentration measurements on marine and freshwater biota, during the period 1984 - 1989. The Chernobyl influence to the Greek aquatic environment was also interpretated in consideration to the organisms' response to the pollution event. Furthermore, marine organisms and freswater fish are suggested as bioindicators for radiocaesium pollution according to the established criteria."

The response of babblers to a life-like, gypsum model of the horned viper (Cerastes gasperettii) was studied in the Arava valley, Israel. I considered three alternative hypotheses to account for mobbing behaviour: investment in other group members, predator-prey interaction and self-advertisement for the formation of dispersal coalitions. Mobbing response varied with group structure: family groups mobbed more than complex groups in which subordinates were potential breeders. Subordinate group members - potential dispersers - mobbed more than dominant breeders, and females mobbed more than males. Babblers did not increase their mobbing response when vulnerable fledglings were present. The results suggest that babblers may increase their investment in anti-predator behaviour when surrounded by close kin, and that immatures may learn about their potential predators during mobbing. However, snake mobbing by Arabian babblers may also serve functions other than anti-predator defence. It is possible that participation in this risky activity may be an honest signal by which subordinate group members advertise their quality as potential members of dispersal coalitions. However, present data provide only indirect evidence, and more work is needed to assess fitness consequences of advertisement for individual group members."

This host species, however, may reduce the risk of parasitism with a frontloaded antiparasite strategy in which it attacks parasites that approach active host nests. To test this frontloaded parasite-defense hypothesis (FPDH), we presented taxidermic models of a female Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), which represents no threat to redwings, a male cowbird, which cannot lay a parasitic egg, and a female cowbird, together with species-and sex-specific vocalization playbacks for 5 min. We conducted these presentations at 25 active redwing nests at Newark Road Prairie in south-central Rock County, Wisconsin, USA, where 18% of redwing nests were parasitized by cowbirds in 2015. As predicted by the FPDH, the female cowbird mount elicited the most aggressive responses and the female cardinal mount the least aggressive, as measured by number of times more than one male redwing responded and number of times the male host attacked the mount, and by Principal Component Analyses yielding the highest redwing aggressive behavior and intimidation scores. Contrary to the predictions of FPDH regarding the success of nest defense behaviors, male redwings responding at naturally parasitized nests were significantly more likely to attack the mount than males with nests that were not parasitized, although our sample size was small. We also compared our results with those of a study using the same methods in New York State where cowbird parasitism was rare. Redwings in Wisconsin were more aggressive toward the female cowbird mount than redwings in New York. Red-winged Blackbirds appear to frontload their antiparasite defenses, but the success of those defenses depends on individual and population-level experience with parasites."

Behavioral ecologists usually test this theory by examining outcomes, particularly whether the equilibrium fraction of animals in each alternative site equals the fraction of resource there (proportional settlement). Population ecologists instead focus on the relevant process: how does dispersion relate to resource distributions and is it density dependent? Isodar analysis is a process-focused method that assesses the relative roles of quantitative and qualitative factors in shaping density dependent settlement. Here, we apply isodar analysis to the dispersions of wild Thomson's gazelles foraging on natural swards in Kenya. Frequent and detailed mapping of resource levels allowed us to delineate rich and poor regions, and to record the densities of foraging females in each region throughout an annual cycle. Whereas quantitative differences attracted more foragers into the rich region at low-ambient densities, the poor region became increasingly favored at higher densities, implying the competing influence of a qualitative factor. Additional regressions suggested that this factor involved predation risk through the following scenario. Intakes were found to increase with proximity to ruminating conspecifics. The latter favored poor regions perhaps for improved predator detection. High wet season food abundance both increased gazelle densities and decreased the costs of foraging in the poor region next to vigilant ruminators. Low dry season food levels resulted in lower gazelle densities, and higher costs of foraging in the poor region despite shared vigilance burdens."

However, an association between low light levels and increased predation risk is not well established empirically. For species that rely on Visual detection of their predators, low light levels call hinder predator detection and thus increase predation risk. We examined the foraging behavior of migrating Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) on a mudflat in the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick, Canada as a function of time of day from dawn to dusk. Time of day was used as a surrogate for light intensity, assuming that, oil average, light levels Would be lower near sunrise and sunset. Sandpipers forage both day and night at low tide, which occurs at different times each day, thus disentangling the effect of light intensity from energy levels. Falcons make surprise attacks on sandpipers by leaving forest cover and flying low over the mud flat, rendering detection difficult against the dark forest background. The propensity for sandpipers to leave a foraging patch by taking flight was higher earlier and later in the day, controlling for temperature and sandpiper density. Pecking Success was similar whether a focal sandpiper stayed in the Current patch or took flight at the end of a focal observation, suggesting that the choice to leave abruptly was not related directly to food availability. We conclude that increased flightiness likely represents a response by sandpipers to a perception of higher predation risk from falcon attacks at low light levels."

In this experimental study, we compared behavioural responses of free-living adult and juvenile Willow Tits Poecile montanus to a conspecific alarm call in two treatments. The alarm call was played back when a focal bird was either not feeding, or feeding on a sunflower seed on the middle part of a spruce branch. When feeding at the time of the alarm call, juveniles more often stayed motionless or moved shorter distances than adults. Our results suggest that in hierarchical groups, juveniles are forced to take greater risks to maintain access to food or lack experience to optimize between food and safety."

A variety of mitigation methods have been deployed with the intent of increasing ungulate awareness of approaching vehicles. Wildlife warning reflectors are one such method. Roadside reflectors are designed to reflect headlights into the right-of-way and alert ungulates to approaching vehicles. Studies of the effectiveness of these reflectors have yielded mixed results. We conducted a robust test of reflectors in central Wyoming, USA, during 2013 and 2014, and unexpectedly discovered a potentially more effective method than the reflectors for reducing collisions between vehicles and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). In our initial experiment, we manipulated 10 1.6-km segments of highway by leaving their reflectors exposed or covering them with a white canvas bag with the intention of neutralizing the reflector. The treatment configuration was swapped monthly. We counted deer carcasses under each treatment for 1 year and observed deer road-crossing behavior using thermal video cameras. Carcass rates were 33% less in the white canvas treatment relative to uncovered reflectors. Deer in the white canvas treatment also stopped before entering the road 20% more often, ran into the road from the right-of-way 11% less often, and fled from the road 12% more often than when reflectors were uncovered. In a follow-up experiment, we found that deer carcass rates were 32% less when reflectors were exposed versus covered with black canvas. We further found that deer road-crossing behavior was least risky in a white canvas treatment, intermediate in a reflectors treatment, and most risky when reflectors were removed from posts. Taken together, these results indicate that, although reflectors were moderately effective, white canvas was substantially more effective in reducing deer-vehicle collisions. This unexpected finding suggests that new vigilance-enhancing mitigation methods should be explored as a way to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions. collisions. (C) 2018 The Wildlife Society."
"Cocroft, RB",Parent-offspring communication in response to predators in a subsocial treehopper (Hemiptera : Membracidae : Umbonia crassicornis),ETHOLOGY,105,553,568,,1999,"The defense of offspring from predators is an important aspect of maternal care in the treehopper Umbonia crassicornis. Nymphal offspring develop in a dense cluster around a host plant stem; and laboratory studies show that they can solicit maternal defense using synchronized vibrational signals. Understanding the function of communication: however, requires not only an experimental investigation of the responses of receivers, but also a description of the context in which signaling takes place in nature. In this study I asked how offspring and parents signal in response to natural predators in the field. I filmed parent-offspring groups to record the behavior of U. crassicornis and their wasp predators (Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Pseudopolybia compressa), along with the substrate-borne vibrational signals produced within the group. I compared the signaling behavior of nymphs, and their mothers, in three contexts: when the family group was undisturbed, when a predatory wasp was present, and when the predator had departed. I assessed the importance of nymphal signals in recruiting the female's initial response by determining whether females or their offspring responded first to a predator's approach. The nymphs produced few synchronized signals when undisturbed, but increased their signaling rate 150-fold in the presence of a wasp. The nymphs continued to signal as long as the wasp was present, and in some cases after it had left, especially if the wasp had contacted or removed a nymph during the encounter. During a wasp's first approach, females responded before the offspring signaled in over half the encounters. Taken together, these results suggest that offspring signals function to influence the mother's behavior throughout a predator encounter, not just to alert her when the predator first appears. Defending females produced signals at a low rate throughout the day and did not significantly increase this rate when a wasp approached. Instead, females began signaling at a high rate only after a wasp had departed. Maternal signals map function to reduce nymphal dispersal after predation events, to reduce the costs of vigilance, or to modify nymphal signaling thresholds in the event of a re-encounter. Both offspring and their mothers, then, signal in response to predators, but using different signals and at different stages of a predation event. In conjunction with experimental studies of signal function, these results show that communication is important in maternal defense of offspring in these subsocial insects."
"Killen, Shaun S.; Fu, Cheng; Wu, Qingyi; Wang, Yu-Xiang; Fu, Shi-Jian",The relationship between metabolic rate and sociability is altered by food deprivation,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,30,1358,1365,10.1111/1365-2435.12634,2016,"Individuals vary in the extent to which they associate with conspecifics, but little is known about the energetic underpinnings of this variation in sociability. Group-living allows individuals to find food more consistently, but within groups, there can be competition for food items. Individuals with an increased metabolic rate could display decreased sociability to reduce competition. Long-term food deprivation (FD) may alter any links between sociability and metabolic rate by affecting motivation to find food. We examined these issues in juvenile qingbo carp Spinibarbus sinensis, to understand how FD and metabolic rate affect sociability. Like many aquatic ectotherms, this species experiences seasonal bouts of FD. Individuals were either: (i) food-deprived for 21days; or (ii) fed a maintenance ration (control). Fish from each treatment were measured for standard metabolic rate (SMR) and tested for sociability twice: once in the presence of a control stimulus shoal and once with a food-deprived stimulus shoal. Control individuals ventured further from stimulus shoals over a 30-min trial, while food-deprived fish did not change their distance from stimulus shoals as trials progressed. Control fish with a higher SMR were least sociable. Well-fed controls showed decreased sociability when exposed to food-deprived stimulus shoals, but there was evidence of consistency in relative sociability between exposures to different shoal types. Results contrast with previous findings that several days of fasting causes individuals to decrease associations with conspecifics. Prolonged FD may cause individuals to highly prioritize food acquisition, and the decreased vigilance that would accompany continuous foraging may heighten the need for the antipredator benefits of shoaling. Conversely, decreased sociability in well-fed fish with a high SMR probably minimizes intraspecific competition, allowing them to satisfy an increased energetic demand while foraging. Together, these results suggest that FD - a challenge common for many ectothermic species - can affect individual sociability as well as the attractiveness of groups towards conspecifics. In addition, the lack of a link between SMR and sociability in food-deprived fish suggests that, insituations where group membership is linked to fitness, the extent of correlated selection on metabolic traits may be context-dependent."

However, the limitations associated with such a compromise have remained largely unexamined. Male Cerulean Warblers (Dendroica cerulea) exhibit nonrandom space-use patterns within their territories, in that all territories contain areas of intensive use or core areas. In addition to documenting territory-wide habitat and behavioral use patterns in this species, we asked two specific questions about core-area structure and function. (1) Are core-area habitats distinct in their vegetative composition and structure from the rest of the territory? (2) What behavioral mechanisms underlie the nonrandom space-use patterns? On a territory-wide basis, males used trees in proportion to their availability; however, core areas were predominantly composed of bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis), which was a highly preferred song-post tree. Core areas were not consistently associated with any other habitat feature, including canopy gaps. Core areas were singing centers; song-post densities within core areas were 10x higher than in noncore areas. In our study area, bitternut hickories have significant delayed leaf-out patterns, potentially offering minimal acoustic hindrance to song transmission until late in the breeding season. These singing centers may be strategically placed to simultaneously maintain vigilance over social nests and maximize communication with conspecifics. Core areas are potentially as important to males as nesting habitat is to females, and their provision should be taken into account when implementing conservation or management strategies."
"Whitfield, DP","Redshank Tringa totanus flocking behaviour, distance from cover and vulnerability to sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus predation",JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY,34,163,169,10.1034/j.1600-048X.2003.03065.x,2003,"Over 11 winters I examined the interactions between sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus attack behaviour, the gregariousness of redshanks Tringa totanus and local geography to test hypotheses that suggest birds should flock to reduce their risk of predation and that predation risk should decline with the prey's distance from cover. Sparrowhawk attacks on redshanks feeding on beaches around the high tide mark (the strandline zone) were more frequent and more successful than attacks on redshanks feeding seaward of the strandline zone (in the intertidal zone). The results therefore confirmed hypothetical expectations that predation risk should decline with distance from cover. Flocking only appeared to influence the outcome of hawk attacks at shorter distances from cover on the strandline, with attacks on singletons and small flocks being more successful than attacks on larger flocks. Distance from cover had a stronger influence on the likelihood of attack success than did flock size. Mid-range flock sizes (6-45 birds) were attacked more frequently than expected, but singletons and large flocks were attacked less than expected. Despite these differences an individual redshank's likelihood of predation by a sparrowhawk declined with increasing flock size, thereby confirming the 'dilution effect' and 'vigilance' hypotheses for the evolution of flocking in birds. Food intake rates of redshanks declined with increasing flock size, further indicating that redshanks flocked to avoid predation rather than to increase their food intake rates. The strong interaction between two influences on predation risk revealed by the present study suggests other studies should take great care when considering a single influence on predation risk in isolation from others."

We leveraged acoustic monitoring and GPS tracking to assess the factors influencing foraging behavior of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). We deployed custom-built acoustic collars with GPS radiocollars on mule deer to measure location-specific foraging. We quantified individual bites and steps taken by deer, and quantified two metrics of foraging behavior: the number of bites taken per step and the number of bites taken per unit time, which relate to foraging intensity and efficiency. We fit statistical models to these metrics to examine the individual, environmental, and anthropogenic factors influencing foraging. Deer in poorer body condition took more bites per step and per minute and foraged for longer irrespective of landscape properties. Other patterns varied seasonally with major changes in deer condition. In December, when deer were in better condition, they took fewer bites per step and more bites per minute. Deer also foraged more intensely and efficiently in areas of greater forage availability and greater movement costs. During March, when deer were in poorer condition, foraging was not influenced by landscape features. Anthropogenic factors weakly structured foraging behavior in December with no relationship in March. Most research on animal foraging is interpreted under the framework of optimal foraging theory. Departures from predictions developed under this framework provide insight to unrecognized factors influencing the evolution of foraging. Our results only conformed to our predictions when deer were in better condition and ecological conditions were declining, suggesting foraging strategies were state-dependent. These results advance our understanding of foraging patterns in wild animals and highlight novel observational approaches for studying animal behavior."
"Chapman, CA; Chapman, LJ",Mixed-species primate groups in the Kibale Forest: Ecological constraints on association,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,17,31,50,10.1007/BF02696157,1996,"Five species of diurnal primates in the Kibale Forest of western Uganda-red colobus (Colobus badius), black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza), redtail monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius), blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis), mangabeys (Cercocebus albigena)-often associate in mired-species groups that vary in size and composition from day to day. Across this range of species, we found no consistent effect of association on feeding rate. In addition, there is no systematic difference between the species-specific individual feeding rates when animals were in mired-species groups feeding in a specific tree on one day and when individuals of one of the same species were feeding in the same individual tree on a subsequent day. If associating in a mixed-species group lowers the risk of predation, one might expect that the number of vigilant events would decrease in mixed-species groups. However, the only species to exhibit a consistent decrease in vigilant behavior when in association was the red colobus. Redtail monkeys were more vigilant when in association. We predicted that the density and distribution of food resources would both constrain the frequency of association and the size of mixed-species groups. Based on 22 months of data on food resources and bimonthly censuses, we found no relationship between the frequency of association (except mangabeys) or mean mired-species group size and the density and distribution of food resources for all species. Finally, we examined the behavior of the monkeys in and out of association before and after the playback of a crowned hawk eagle call (Spizaetus coronatus), a known predator. When more species were in association, the amount of time they spent being vigilant following the playback was greater and the response more intense than when fewer species were in association or when the group was alone. The results of this study illustrate that the nature of the costs and benefits of polyspecific associations for these different monkey species are complex and vary from species to species."
"Venkataraman, AB",Do dholes (Cuon alpinus) live in packs in response to competition with or predation by large cats?,CURRENT SCIENCE,69,934,936,,1995,"Interactions between carnivores during the defence of kills may be one reason why certain carnivores live in groups. This is especially true of lions, hyaenas and the African wild dog, The dhole or the Asiatic wild dog, primarily a pack living animal, has been observed to regularly interact with both tigers and leopards, Such interactions have taken place over kills and otherwise. In this report, five such interactions are described, It was found that the pack's behaviour of surrounding bushes acid trees on which the cat was confined precluded immediate escape. The presence of sentinels, while the pack was resting, warned the pack of the presence of a big cat and the pack grouped when a big cat appeared, Costs to both individuals within the dhole packs and the cats involved in the encounters were found to be slight, The reasons for such potentially costly encounters could be competition for finite food resources or thwarting predation, Dholes have a significant diet overlap with both leopards and tigers and aggressively encounter with leopards but not with tigers, Differences between diet overlaps may not be the basis behind the differences in aggression, It is more likely that, the small size of leopards and the fact that they predate more often on dholes, cause dhole packs to be more aggressive to leopards than to tigers, The size of carnivore groups may thus pose an advantage during competitive interactions among carnivore species."

In the former, different categories of predators evoke structurally distinct call types which elicit different responses also in the absence of the predator stimulus. In the latter, call parameters and/or call use vary gradually with the degree of perceived risk. However, call types that are typically uttered in the presence of a certain predator category may occasionally occur also in response to other predators. Such 'cross taxon calling' indicates the possibility that also the differential use of acoustically distinct call types could be urgency based. The call system of Arabian babblers (Turdoides squamiceps) comprises three structurally distinct alarm call types. Two of them seem to be predominantly used towards two different predator types, but all call types also occur simultaneously in the same predator context. We hypothesised that in Arabian babblers the differential use of alarm call types reflects an urgency based alarm call system. To test this, we confronted groups of Arabian babblers with an owl dummy in two different distances ('near' and 'far'), representing two degrees of risk or response urgency. We found that not general call type occurrence but call use differed between the two treatments: birds started trilling earlier in the near treatment and uttered more barks in the far treatment. We conclude that the differential use of call types is mediated by the degree of threat a caller perceives. Finally, we synthesize our results together with the findings of other field studies on alarm calling in Arabian babblers and suggest different functions for the three different call types based on their distance related occurrence and acoustic characteristics."

Signals may alternatively be directed at potential predators to discourage pursuit. Rails (Family Rallidae) are ground-dwelling birds, many of which inhabit wetlands, while others occur in forests and grasslands. They are renown for their secretive nature and the tendency to flick their tails when observed. This behavior is more conspicuous in species with white undertail coverts that contrast sharply with darker body plumage. Using species comparisons and controlling for phylogeny, we investigated four hypotheses for the evolution of white undertail coverts in rails. We found little support for the hypothesis that white tails are sexually selected: white tails were not more common in species with polygamous as opposed to monogamous mating systems, species with sexual dimorphism, nor species that display their tails in courtship. Nor did our results support the hypothesis that white tail plumage evolved for intersexual competition during territorial interactions. Instead, we found that species that flock for at least part of the year and species found in open as opposed to concealing habitats were significantly more likely to have white undertail coverts. Rail species inhabiting concealing habitats are less commonly gregarious and more likely selected for crypsis. Using phylogenetically-controlled statistical inference we found that adaptation to open wetland habitats significantly precedes the evolution of white undertails, whereas gregariousness likely evolved later in some lineages. The inferred order of trait evolution suggests that this plumage characteristic could have been selected primarily for enhancement of an anti-predator signal rather than a social signal for conspecifics."

Soil moisture is one of the key variables in land surface modelling, and an inadequate initial soil moisture field can introduce major biases in the surface heat and moisture fluxes and have a long-lasting effect on the model behaviour. Detecting the variability of soil characteristics at small scales is particularly important in mesoscale models because of the continued increase of their spatial resolution. In this paper, the high resolution soil moisture field derived from ENVISAT/ASAR observations is used to derive the soil moisture initial condition for the MM5 simulation of the Tanaro flood event of April 2009. The ASAR-derived soil moisture field shows significantly drier conditions compared to the ECMWF analysis. The impact of soil moisture on the forecast has been evaluated in terms of predicted precipitation and rain gauge data available for this event have been used as ground truth. The use of the drier, highly resolved soil moisture content (SMC) shows a significant impact on the precipitation forecast, particularly evident during the early phase of the event. The timing of the onset of the precipitation, as well as the intensity of rainfall and the location of rain/no rain areas, are better predicted. The overall accuracy of the forecast using ASAR SMC data is significantly increased during the first 30 h of simulation. The impact of initial SMC on the precipitation has been related to the change in the water vapour field in the PBL prior to the onset of the precipitation, due to surface evaporation. This study represents a first attempt to establish whether high resolution SAR-based SMC data might be useful for operational use, in anticipation of the launch of the Sentinel-1 satellite."

The welfare implications of different subtypes of inactivity in mink,APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,144,138,146,10.1016/j.applanim.2013.01.008,2013,"Effects of sub-optimal housing on inactivity vary across species and experiments, probably because inactivity is heterogeneous, reflecting both positive states (e.g. relaxation) and negative ones (e.g. fear). We therefore aimed to identify specific subtypes of inactivity that could indicate poor welfare in mink, by comparing their behaviour in enriched and non-enriched conditions (the former having been previously demonstrated to be highly preferred by mink and to enhance their welfare). We assessed this in three groups of subjects, as well as after housing conditions were reversed for the last group. During live scans, inactive animals were scored for posture, location, and whether awake or apparently asleep. Data on temperament and physiological stress indicators were also collected for one group; these confirmed that non-enriched housing increased faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM; P = 0.040). Non-enriched housing also increased locomotor stereotypy in females (sex x housing: P = 0.004). Inactivity in the nest-box (vs. in the open cage) was higher among females in non-enriched housing (housing x sex: P < 0.001), and increased by 20% of observations after enrichment removal (P = 0.018) for both sexes. Furthermore, males With fearful temperaments spent the most time inactive in the nest-box (sex x temperament: P = 0.054), while females whose FCM decreased most when given enrichment also showed the largest decreases in this behaviour (sex x FCM change: P = 0.019). Together, this suggests that inactivity in the nest-box may reflect anxiety-induced hiding. Lying awake (i.e. prone with eyes open) was also higher in non-enriched housing (3.1% of observations vs. 1.7%; P = 0.002); furthermore, this subtype of inactivity increased after enrichment removal (by 1.0% of observations; P = 0.021), and decreased when non-enriched mink were given enrichment (by 2.4% of observations; P = 0.004). This behaviour did not co-vary with fearfulness, however, nor with FCM (both P > 0.05). This suggests that lying awake is not fear-related (e.g. not reflecting enhanced vigilance) but instead reflects some other negative state. Effects on inactivity subtypes as defined by posture were less consistent. For example, time spent lying belly down tended to decrease in mink moved from non-enriched to enriched cages (P = 0.054), but enriched mink spent significantly less time belly down (in one of the three groups; P = 0.002). Overall, two subtypes of inactivity, lying in the nest-box and lying awake seem likely to be valid indicators of housing-induced poor welfare in this species, being consistently increased by non-enriched cages. Lying in the nest-box may indicate fear or anxiety, and lying awake, a boredom-like state. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

With the introduction of automated driving systems, the chance of getting sleepy and even falling asleep at wheel could increase further. Conventional sleepiness detection methods based on driving performance and behavior may not be available under automated driving. Methods based on physiological measurements such as heart rate variability (HRV) becomes a potential solution under automated driving. However, with reduced task load, HRV could potentially be affected by automated driving. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the influence of automated driving on the relation between HRV and sleepiness. Data from real-road driving experiments with 43 participants were used in this study. Each driver finished four trials with manual and partial automated driving under normal and sleep-deprived condition. Heart rate was monitored by consumer wearable chest bands. Subjective sleepiness based on Karolinska sleepiness scale was reported at five min interval as ground truth. Reduced heart rate and increased overall variability were found in association with severe sleepy episodes. A binary classifier based on the AdaBoost method was developed to classify alert and sleepy episodes. The results indicate that partial automated driving has small impact on the relationship between HRV and sleepiness. The classifier using HRV features reached area under curve (AUC) = 0.76 and it was improved to AUC = 0.88 when adding driving time and day/night information. The results show that commercial wearable heart rate monitor has the potential to become a useful tool to assess driver sleepiness under manual and partial automated driving."

We studied the leg morphology of two contrasting tit species (flue Tit, Parus caeruleus, and Crested Tit, P. cristatus). Results demonstrated that the leg morphology of the Blue Tit provides it with greater ecological plasticity in terms of foraging posture than that of the Crested Tit. Observed interspecific differences in ecological plasticity are not attributable to interspecific differences in morphological variability (between individuals within species). The morphofunctional bases of ecological plasticity in foraging posture are discussed. Morphological design may be considered an important factor in explaining niche width and potential for niche shifts, as morphology might determine the range of ecological ''space'' within which a species is allowed to move. The same niche shift in different species could represent different costs when morphological constraints are considered in relation to behavioural performance."

We examined the separate and joint effects of food-safety tradeoffs and food chemistry on the foraging of free-ranging samango monkeys (Cercopithecus (nictitans) mitis erythrarchus) at Lajuma, South Africa. We conducted giving up density (GUD, the amount of food left behind by a forager) experiments with peanuts treated with secondary compounds (quebracho tannin, tannic acid, or oxalic acid) offered in safe and risky microhabitats. Effects of the compounds would manifest as higher GUDs relative to a control treatment. Moreover, secondary compounds should cause a greater increase in GUDs in the risky microhabitat. GUDs were higher in patches containing oxalic acid-treated peanuts than in patches with either of the tannin-treated or the untreated peanuts. Moreover, the samangos experienced an interaction of predation costs and secondary compounds: the GUDs on oxalates relative to control peanuts were higher in the risky microhabitat. As predicted, the samangos traded food for safety, and the effect was most pronounced when the control was paired with the least desirable food (oxalic acid). We provide evidence that the marginal value of energy is influenced by the presence of plant toxins, the predation cost of foraging, and the interaction of the two."

We studied harassment and abduction of pups by nonterritorial male northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) on St. Paul Island, Alaska, from 1993 to 1998. Juvenile, subadult, and adult males entered the breeding area and sniffed, bit, grabbed, or mounted pups. They also abducted pups to other places on land or to sea. Three pup mortalities caused by drowning, skull damage, or separation from the mother leading to emaciation were observed during the study period. Nonterritorial males did not exhibit a preference for the sexes of pups they attacked, and never consumed dead pups. Intrusions of juvenile and subadult males into breeding areas increased in the late breeding season, when harassment and abduction of pups occurred frequently. Frequency of intrusion and harassment of pups by adult nonterritorial males was lower than that by juvenile and subadult males, and did not increase in the late breeding season. On average, each pup was harassed or abducted 3.8 times in a breeding season. Pups changed their behavior to avoid nonterritorial males as pups moved out of the central breeding area in the late breeding season. Territorial males protected pups indirectly through territory defense, but their vigilance against juvenile and subadult males diminished in the late breeding season. Adult females protected their pups against juvenile and subadult males only while they were attending pups within the breeding territories. However, formation of breeding aggregation in rocky habitats may contribute to reducing the risk of harassment of pups by nonterritorial males because it provides pups with protection by territorial males as well as shelters created by irregular terrain."

Feeding activity and body reserves of wintering great tits Parus major in response to the priority to food access were studied in two areas differing in incidence of predators. The one-predator area contained sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus only, whereas the two-predator area contained both sparrowhawks and pygmy owls Glaucidium passerinum, whose hunting periods overlap at dawn and dusk. In the two-predator area dominant great tits arrived at feeders significantly later in the morning, and left earlier in the evening, than their subordinate flock-mates. Hence, feeding day length of dominants was found to be significantly shorter. The reverse was true for the one-predator area. In addition, dominants carried significantly greater reserves than subordinates in the area inhabited by two predators. Factors constraining subcutaneous energy reserves were also studied in removal experiments. After the removal of dominant individuals, subordinate great tits did not reduce their body reserves in the two predator area. In contrast, subordinate great tits significantly reduced evening body reserves in the single-predator area. I concluded that the presence of the two predators increases unpredictability in feeding conditions for great tits. Dominant individuals responded to this by shortening their feeding day and increasing body reserves at dusk."

In the sight of reconstructing incomplete displacement data, this letter presents a data-driven spatiotemporal gap-filling method, which is an extension of the expectation-maximization-empirical orthogonal function (EM-EOF) method. The presented method decomposes an augmented spatiotemporal covariance of a displacement time series into EOF modes and then selects the optimal set of EOF modes to reconstruct the time series. This selection is based on the cross-validation root-mean-square error and a confidence index associated with each eigenvalue. The estimated missing values are then iteratively updated until convergence. Results on displacement time series derived from cross correlation of Sentinel-2 optical images over Fox Glacier in New-Zealand's Alps show that the reconstruction accuracy is improved compared with the EM-EOF method. The proposed extension can tackle challenging cases, i.e., short time series with heterogeneous displacement behaviors corrupted by a large amount of missing data and noise."

As far as we are aware, this work represents the first application of HOMER to a long-term precipitation network and bodes well for use in other regions. It is expected that the homogenized IIP network will find wider utility in benchmarking and supporting climate services across the Island of Ireland, a sentinel location in the North Atlantic."

Such responses are predicted to vary among individuals as a function of the level of risk to which individuals are exposed, temporal changes in risk, and landscape-mediated changes in perceived risk. We tested how GPS-tracked moose (Alces alces,n = 19) responded to an emerging risk landscape with the introduction of hunting to a naive population (large-scale reduction experiment in Gros Morne National Park, Canada). We predicted that predation risk associated with hunters would influence moose habitat selection: Avoidance responses would be stronger during the day when hunting was allowed, and moose would learn to avoid risky locations which would strengthen in successive years for survivors occupying overall riskier home ranges. We found that moose avoided areas associated with a high risk of encounters with hunters but did not alter selection patterns between day and night. We did not find evidence of moose reacting more strongly to emerging risk as a function of risk within their home range. Moose did not increase their avoidance of areas associated with hunter risk across years but over time survivors selected non-hunted refuge areas more frequently. Our results suggest that while moose did not adjust fine-scale habitat selection through time to increased hunting risk, they did adjust selection at broader scales (based on proportions of hunter-free habitat included in home range relative to study area). This finding supports the hypothesis that habitat selection at larger spatio-temporal scales may reflect behavioral responses to a population's most important limiting factors, which may not be apparent at finer scales."

Our main hypothesis is that the number of birds and their minimal distance from groups of human visitors are correlated with the number of visitors in the groups. Visitor and bird populations were mapped simultaneously in order to analyze the effect of location on the behavior of different species of birds. Fieldwork was carried out at four observation points throughout the wetlands. 48 field observation days were conducted during 2009. The research demonstrates a cyclical interaction: the number of visitors increases when more birds are present, but as the number of visitors increases, the number of birds decreases and their minimum distance from the visitors increases. The findings allow for a better understanding of the Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) of the Lake, instead of identifying a general measure of Carrying Capacity. The discussion considers the study's theoretical implications, as well as practical recommendations for future development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Our objective was to compare behaviour patterns in chipmunk populations occupying mature continuous forest versus mature forested corridors (100 m wide) surrounded by clearcuts. Chipmunks spent a significantly greater proportion of their time pausing in the forested-corridor habitat than in the continuous-forest habitat. In addition, chipmunks spent less time locomoting and foraging in the forested-corridor habitat than in the continuous forest. We attributed differences in behaviour patterns between chipmunks in the two forest types primarily to the influence of forest fragmentation on the risk of predation and to the availability of food resources."

I hypothesized that habituation would cause anti-predator behaviors to decrease in urban settings in response to humans. Additionally, I hypothesized that populations habituated to humans would show reduced responses to other predator stimuli. I observed three populations of squirrels (urban, suburban and rural) responses to human approaches, red-tailed hawk vocalizations (Buteo jamaicensis) and coyote (Canis latrans) vocalizations. Mahalanobis distances of anti-predator behaviors in response to human approaches were consistent with the urban-rural gradient. Flight initiation distances (X (2) = 26.33, df = 2, P < 0.001) and amount of time dedicated to anti-predator behavior (X (2) = 10.94, df = 2, P = 0.004) in response to human approaches were also consistent with the urban-rural gradient. Supporting the habituation hypothesis, naive juvenile squirrels increased flight initiation distances (X (2) = 35.89, df = 1, P < 0.001) and time dedicated to anti-predator behaviors (X (2) = 9.46, df = 1, P = 0.002) relative to adult squirrels in the same urban environment. Time dedicated to anti-predator behaviors differed among all three sites in response to both coyote (X (2) = 9.83, df = 2, P = 0.007) and hawk (X (2) = 6.50, df = 2, P = 0.035) vocalizations. Responses to both vocalizations on rural sites (coyote = 45%, hawk = 55%) greater than twice that found on the urban sites (coyote = 11%, hawk = 20%). This is possibly the first case of a transfer of habituation demonstrated under field conditions."
"Choi, Seoyun; Grocutt, Emma; Erlandsson, Rasmus; Angerbjorn, Anders",Parent personality is linked to juvenile mortality and stress behavior in the arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus),BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,73,,,10.1007/s00265-019-2772-y,2019,"Life history theory predicts that individuals will differ in their risk-taking behavior according to their expected future fitness. Understanding consequences of such individual variation within a behavioral trait is crucial in explaining potential trade-offs between different traits and in predicting future dynamics in changing environments. Here, we studied individuals in a wild arctic fox population to explore if (1) individual variation in risk-taking behaviors of adult arctic foxes and in stress-dealing behaviors of their juveniles exist and are consistent over time to verify the existence of personality traits; (2) those behavioral traits in adults and juveniles are correlated; (3) they can explain fitness-related components (i.e., juvenile physical condition, mortality rate). We presented simple field experiments assessing behavioral traits by observing adult reactions toward approaching observers, and juvenile behaviors while trapping. Through the experiments, we found highly consistent individual variation of adults in vigilance and boldness levels, and more flexible juvenile behavioral traits categorized as investigating, passive, and escaping. The offspring of bolder adults exhibited more investigating behaviors and were less passive than the offspring of shy adults. Juvenile physical condition was not related to their mortality nor any behavioral traits of either parents or themselves. Lastly, highly investigating and active juveniles with bold parents had significantly lower mortality rates. This shows that interactions between parent personality and juvenile behavioral traits affect a fitness-related component in the life history of individuals.Significance statementThe recent surge of interest in consistent individual difference in behavior, also called as animal personality, has already focused on its fitness consequences, but few studies have investigated the interactions between parent and offspring personality, and their ecological consequences. Moreover, this has rarely been studied in wild canids. The arctic fox is a charismatic species showing wide individual variation in behaviors. They live in highly fluctuating tundra ecosystems providing different selection regimes, making it even more eco-evolutionarily intriguing. Yet, few studies looked into behavioral traits and their importance in this system. While introducing simple methods to improve personality research in the wild, we provide a unique example of how variation in both parents and their juveniles collectively works for group dynamics in a cyclic population. This provides a firm basic for understanding behavior-mediated dynamics and opens up broader questions on how fluctuating environments exert varying pressures on individual differences."

Because parasitoids dispersing from the release fields might pose a threat to native butterflies, the searching efficiency of T. brassicae was investigated in nontarget habitats.2 In field studies, T. brassicae was released at rates of 120 000 females/ha. Parasitism of sentinel Ephestia kuehniella egg clusters was 1.6-3.6% in meadows and 2.0-4.0% in flower strips. The respective figures were 57.6-66.7% and 19.2-46.9% in maize, significantly higher than the parasitism rates in the nontarget habitats. Experiments carried out in small field cages confirmed these results: Again, significantly higher parasitism rates were found in maize compared to meadows and flower strips, and also compared to hedgerows (in sleeve cages).3 To elucidate potential factors underlying the low searching efficiency in nontarget habitats, the behaviour of individual T. brassicae females was investigated on four meadow plants comparatively to maize and a filter paper control. Mean ( SE) walking speed on maize was 2.2 +/- 0.2 mm/s, similar to three of the plants tested and filter paper but significantly higher than on Trifolium pratense (0.85 mm/s). A higher turning rate was found on T pratense, Viola wittrockiana and Plantago lanceolata, in contrast to the longer leaved maize and Alopecurus pratensis. The number of wasps leaving the plant within the observation period differed significantly between plant species, and was twice as high for T. pratense (and the filter paper control) compared to the other plant species.4 In a choice experiment carried out in a climate cabinet with all five host plant species in cages, we obtained the highest parasitism rates on maize and the lowest parasitism on T. pratense, thus confirming the behavioural observations.5 In conclusion, there is evidence for a decreased searching efficiency on plants in nontarget habitats compared to maize. However, the data explain only part of the differences found between parasitism in maize compared to nontarget habitats. Other factors, such as the structural complexity of a habitat, may also play a role. We conclude that the risk for butterfly populations in the tested nontarget habitat due to mass released T. brassicae is low."

Prior to wolf reintroduction, the primary cause of mortality for elk wintering in Yellowstone was starvation (Houston 1982, Garrott et al. 2003, Chapter 10 by Garrott et al., this volume). After wolf reintroduction, predation was the primary cause of death, and survival and recruitment decreased significantly (Garrott et al. 2005, White and Garrott 2005, Creel et al. 2007, Chapter 23 by Garrott et al., this volume). Anti-predator behaviors such as increased vigilance, shifts in distribution to lower risk areas, and increases in group size could impose additional trade-offs in diet selection due to reduced forage availability, intake, or quality; thereby resulting in decreased nutrition, nutritional condition and, in turn, reproduction and survival (Morgantini and Hudson 1985, Ives and Dobson 1987, Illius and FitzGibbon 1994, Heithaus and Dill 2002, Cowlishaw et al. 2004, Creel et al. 2007). White et al. (Chapter 9, this volume) provided an understanding of the diet composition and nutrition of elk in the Madison headwaters area of Yellowstone National Park when the sole limiting factor was starvation due to chronic under-nutrition and energetic costs, and other limiting factors such as predation and hunting were minimal or absent. We evaluated the nutritional status of these elk after wolves began colonizing the system to determine how elk nutrition changed when they were confronted with tradeoffs between predation risk and starvation."

Such rhythms are strongly synchronised with the annual cyclic changes by environmental stimuli, the so-called zeitgebers. Animals' reliance on environmental stimuli is highly species-specific and allows behavioural adjustments to be made in preparation for the conditions expected in each season. We investigated daily and annual activity rhythms of Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) by analysing high-resolution data of animals monitored with GPS collars. This first detailed field study of chamois activity showed that this species exhibited clear daily and annual activity rhythms entrained to the light-dark cycle. Chamois were more active during spring-summer and less active during winter, likely in response to the variation in the availability of food resources: both sexes appeared to maximise energy intake during the season offering the highest amount of food resources to compensate for poor food supply during winter. Daily activity was influenced by the climatic factors considered. We showed a negative correlation between daily activity and adverse climatic conditions (i.e. precipitation and, during winter, snow depth). As activity was strongly influenced by the interplay between temperature and wind throughout the year and by radiation and wind in winter, we conjectured that it was critically dependent upon animals' thermal balance. In conclusion, our study highlighted that chamois is well adapted to the Alpine environment and seasonality but also raised questions about its ability to adapt to future climate change.In this study, we investigated the effects of ecological factors on Alpine chamois activity. Thanks to radio collars with accelerometers, we obtained highly detailed information on activity levels of wild animals. We found that chamois were more active during spring-summer (i.e. the seasons with the highest quality and quantity of food) and less active during winter. Our results showed that chamois activity was strongly influenced by such climatic factors as temperature, precipitation and wind speed. In winter time, chamois activity increased during the days with high solar radiation and decreased with high snow depth. Given their wide distribution in the Alps, chamois can be considered as a sentinel species of Alpine habitats. Thus, our results on the current relationship between climate and chamois behaviour may shed light on the animals' ability to track and adapt to climate change."

Our model includes producers, scroungers, and an opportunistic forager that can both produce and scrounge but with reduced efficiency. We show that these three strategies can coexist only in the unlikely case that the opportunist's loss in searching ability is exactly equal to its gain in scrounging ability. However, all pairs of strategies can coexist. Three parameters control the proportions of coexisting strategists: the degree of compatibility between the opportunist's producing and scrounging activities; the proportion of food patches that are shared with scrounging individuals; and the effective group size. When there is little incompatibility between producing and scrounging, opportunists will always be present, unless the producer is able to consume most of the patch without sharing. The opportunist strategy is always excluded when there is a high degree of incompatibility between producing and scrounging. We consider the organismal and ecological factors that are likely to affect all three parameters. Our model predicts that scrounging behavior is likely to be selected in a wide range of foraging groups and that it may impose a considerable cost on sociality."

Forest birds were color-banded monthly starting December 1999. Sixty-three observations of flocks were made containing a total of 10 species with a mean (+- SD) of 2.8 +- 0.9 species and 5.4 +- 1.8 individuals per flock. The entire Polylepis bird community contained 30 core species. Since the forest was small, most flocks contained at least some of the same individuals. Three species occurred in > 70% (Giant Conebill Oreomanes fraseri Tawny Tit-Spine-tail Leptasthenura yanacensis, and White-throated Tyrannulet Mecocerculus leucophrys, with 2.6 +- 0.6, 1.9 +- 0.6, and 1.6 +- 0.5 individuals per flock respectively), one species (Asthenes dorbignyi with 1.4 +- 0.5 individuals per flock) in 21%, and the remaining six species in pnd 5% of all flocks. All flock participants except one were insectivores. Individuals of O. fraseri showed high intraspecific group or pair fidelity and often, but not always, acted as flock leader, whereas the sentinel role was mainly assumed by L. yanacensis or A. dorbignyi. For the three species regularly associated with mixed-species flocks, home ranges of banded individuals observed in flocks were determined. Mean home ranges (100% minimum convex polygons) were 6.13 +- 0.87 ha for O. fraseri (n = 4), 2.13 +- 1.26 ha for L. yanacensis (n = 6), and 3.41 +- 2.73 ha for M. leucophrys (n = 3). Intraspecific home range overlap was moderate to high in all species, clear associations of Tawny Tit-Spinetail and White-throated Tyrannulet individuals with one of the two Giant Conebill pairs/groups were lacking, and agonistic interactions were almost absent except in August. In other words, neither individuals nor flocks were territorial, and flocks were much more loosely structured than those studied in Neotropical lowlands, resembling in some respects mixed-species flocks in northern temperate zones. Selective advantages of mixed flocks in Polylepis forests are briefly discussed, finding support only for the predation avoidance hypothesis."

The whole colony was either involved in singing activity around the nest boxes, or feeding as one big flock in fields. Switches between these 2 activities were sudden and complete with it short intermediate stage when all the birds gathered in a tight group on overhead electricity wires. The switches between singing and feeding occurred approximately twice an hour, and local weather conditions had no apparent effect on these switches in behaviour. As egg-laying approached, more time was spent at the nestbox colony, with fewer birds feeding in the fields at any one time. Later in the season longer initial periods were spent at the nestbox colony before the first feeding excursions to the fields, resulting in fewer switches between singing and feeding activities. The switches between the 2 activities also became less distinct nearer egg-laying with the flock breaking up into smaller units and feeding in fields closer to the nestbox colony."

Most gazelles formed groups of one to three individuals all year round. This small herd size recorded in our study area was probably a consequence of the feeding ecology of the goitered gazelle, which is a very selective ruminant of small body size. With respect to group composition, female and male groups were the most often noted (52.0% and 37.9%), while mixed herds and groups of yearlings were considerably rarer (4.6% and 5.5%). Moreover, mixed groups were the largest groups (mean +/- SE: 5.29 +/- 0.25 individuals per group), followed by female groups (2.40 +/- 0.03), male groups (2.14 +/- 0.05), and yearling herds (1.49 +/- 0.05). In addition, the grouping pattern varied seasonally and corresponded very closely to the yearly breeding cycle of the goitered gazelle. Nevertheless, it remains consistent with what is known of the grouping pattern of other gazelles."

Single animals accounted for the majority of observed kob antelopes. Time allocated to certain behavioural traits depended on group size, with animals in smaller units spending less time on behaviours sensitive to predation risk. Single animals allocated far less time to ruminating and feeding being more vigilant and walking more. Groups were highly fluid and associations between individuals could be predicted by home-range overlap among females but not for female/male associations where association indices might be influenced by reproductive aims. Frequency of social groupings did not change compared with earlier studies when population density was much higher. However, compared with these studies maximum group size decreased, and smaller groups became more abundant. The observed effect of group size on the time budget of kob antelopes in combination with a steady decrease in group size because of reduction in population size might have a severe impact on the long-term persistence of the studied kob population due to anticipated aggravated predation effects. As males form the majority of single animals, putting them on higher predation risk, number of males decreases more rapidly than the number of females, which might eventually lead to a collapse of the kob population."

Rearing methods did not affect survival first year post-release, which was 55 +/-8% in 2 yr (1999 and 2000). Logistic regression revealed, however, that foraging bouts (+), walking bouts (-), and body weight (-) before release, and nonvigilant bouts (-) after release were significantly associated with survival.

We considered the case of the highly endangered Vancouver Island marmot (Marmota vancouverensis). Predation is a current source of mortality, and inadequate anti-predator behavior could have profound ramifications for the future success of re-introductions. We tested whether M, vancouverensis anti-predator behavior was unusual or 'deficient' by quantifying it and comparing it to 13 other marmot species. We found no evidence that Vancouver Island marmots were unwary. If anything, the converse was true. Vancouver Island marmots were responsive and vigilant towards real and simulated predatory threats. They dug numerous escape burrows that reduced the likelihood of predation. Our results have several implications for future recovery efforts, one of which was to establish 'baseline' flight-response targets that captive-bred Vancouver Island marmots will have to meet or exceed prior to release into predator-rich environments."

Size-related differences in behavior and ecology of granivorous birds,ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA,49,119,130,10.3161/000164514X682940,2014,"Seed-eating birds may consume seeds in the tree (pre-dispersal predation) as well as on the ground (post-dispersal predation), usually at contrasting microhabitat conditions. We examined the foraging behaviour and contribution to seed predation of a whole assemblage of seed-eating birds (mostly Fringillidae) at both dispersal phases (pre- and post-dispersal) in a wind-dispersed tree, the European White Elm Ulmus laevis. We found that most seed predators were tree-feeding birds that prey upon seeds for longer periods in the tree and spend shorter periods in larger flocks foraging on the ground. We also obtained significant differences in predation speed among the seed predator species. The overall number of seeds consumed by birds, as well as the amount of time spent foraging in the tree, increased with increasing feeding heights. Seed availability increases with height, which seems to be the main reason why birds spend more time foraging on higher branches. Birds strongly differed in their perching coefficient (PC, ration of feeding height to distance from crown edge). Small finches such as Serins Serinus serinus and Goldfinches Carduelis carduelis had a very high value of PC in comparison to large finches such as Greenfinches Carduelis chloris, Chaffinches Fringilla coelebs, and Hawfinches Coccothraustes coccothraustes. In general, finches showed much higher values of PC than non-fringillid species, indicating a greater adaptation to perch and feed on more flexible stems. Birds increased their overall seed predation and the time allocated to foraging on the ground when they were in flocks. Small finches tended to follow larger finches and flock in multispecies groups when foraging on the ground. We suggest that this behaviour increases both feeding efficiency and safety. Further studies should take into account possible differences in behavior of seed-eating birds throughout the dispersal season since it may have important implications for their adaptive behavior to select new niches."

I compared the foraging behaviors of infant, juvenile and adult squirrel monkeys to determine if significant age-related differences in foraging behavior and efficiency were present. Infants and juveniles differed from each other in patterns of prey and fruit foraging, but few differences existed between juveniles and adults. Despite differing in the use of foraging substrates, young juveniles (8-12 mo) were as efficient as older juveniles (1-4 yr) and adults at capturing and processing large prey. Young juveniles (< 1 yr) were limited in their ability to consume husked palm fruits due to an inability to peel them to obtain pulp. By 1 yr of age, however, foraging behaviors of adults and juveniles were nearly indistinguishable. The absence of meaningful differences between adults and juvenile foraging is not consistent with the hypothesis that the need to develop foraging skills accounts for the pattern of extended juvenility in squirrel monkeys."

Many studies suggest such pre-service fatigue can result in poor working performance and high casualty risks among construction workers. To ensure workers are well-rested before duties, contractors initiate various pre-service fatigue screening approaches. Traditional screening highly relies on the site managers' subjective judgment and workers' physical appearances due to the lack of practical, objective, and automated fatigue assessment tools. In addition, compared with physical fatigue, mental fatigue is even more difficult to be recognized merely through observation. This research proposes a novel screening method capable of measuring workers' mental fatigue with wearable electroencephalography (EEG) equipment. Through analyzing the EEG spectral parameters, such as gravity frequency and power spectral entropy, this study implemented four assessing indicators and developed a quantitative method to assess a subject's mental fatigue level. To verify the proposed method, an in-lab fatigue test was conducted. The experiment results reported that the screening targets can be successfully identified by comparing their test performance and reaction time."
"Martin, Graham R.",Visual fields and their functions in birds,JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY,148,S547,S562,10.1007/s10336-007-0213-6,2007,"Among birds there are considerable interspecific differences in all aspects of visual fields. However, it is hypothesised that the topography of the frontal binocular portion of fields are of only three main types, and their principal functions lie in the degree to which vision is used in the guidance of the bill (or feet) towards food objects or for the provisioning of chicks. In the majority of birds, the width of the frontal binocular field is narrow (20 degrees-30 degrees maximum). It shows a high degree of similarity across species and appears to be independent of phylogeny or ecology. Binocularity appears not to be concerned with higher level visual processing involving the combination of information from the two eyes (as in, for example, stereoscopic vision). Binocularity is concerned with gaining independently, in each eye, information which is derived from the symmetrically expanding optic flow-field, which specifies the direction of travel of the head and its time to contact an object, as in pecking or lunging at food items. Species which do not provision their chicks, and whose foraging is guided by tactile cues or which filter feed, have much smaller binocular overlap (10 degrees) and this seems sufficient to control flight. These birds gain comprehensive visual coverage of the celestial hemisphere and show reduced vigilance behaviour. The visual fields of owls, which combine more extensive binocular overlap (50 degrees) with a large blind area behind the head, may not be primarily associated with nocturnal activity. Visual fields of this type are not found in other nocturnally active birds such as Oilbirds, nightjars and kiwis. The type of visual field found in owls may be a result of large eyes combined with elaborate outer ear structures that are placed within a relatively small skull. Eye movements of significant amplitude do not occur in all birds. However, eye movements of between 14 degrees and 18 degrees occur in species such as herons, hornbills and cormorants and can result in the spontaneous abolition of binocularity. These eye movements are non-conjugate and can produce markedly asymmetric visual fields. The width of any blind area above the head is a function of eye size, with the largest eyes associated with optical adnexa, (eye lashes, brows). These may be associated with avoiding imaging the sun on the retina. However, many small-eyed birds have no optical adnexa and cannot avoid seeing the sun."
"LOUGHRY, WJ",DETERMINANTS OF TIME ALLOCATION BY ADULT AND YEARLING BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE DOGS,BEHAVIOUR,124,23,43,10.1163/156853993X00489,1993,"The time budgets of all adult and yearling black-tailed prairie dogs in a wild population were measured in 14 separate samples between late April and mid-August 1989. In general, males were more vigilant and fed less than females did. This sex difference was due largely to the behavior of males that had sired offspring; non-fathers behaved more like females. As the summer progressed, prairie dogs spent more time feeding and less time vigilant. The lone exception to this pattern was mothers, who fed less and spent more time vigilant as the summer progressed. Other influences on time allocation produced similar effects for all sex/parental groups: animals were more vigilant while in tall vegetation and in the early morning as opposed to mid-day or evening. Environmental (e.g. weather) and social (e.g. number of other adults and pups present) effects on time allocation were analyzed via multiple regression. Of all potential influences, distance from the nearest burrow seemed to have the most consistent impact on time allocation for all individuals. These results point to strong effects of sex, parental status and environmental context in determining the particular pattern of time allocation observed in an individual prairie dog."

Ducklings are targeted by a range of terrestrial, aerial and aquatic predators, giving a strong selective advantage to individuals and broods that have effective ways to avoid predation. In experiments on naive mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings without an accompanying adult female we investigated the innate ability to identify and avoid threats at varying intensity from aerial, aquatic and terrestrial predators. Ducklings displayed increased vigilance in response to pre-recorded calls of predatory birds, representing a low level of threat. They did not react to visual and olfactory stimuli generated by motionless northern pike (Esox lucius). Neither did they show a strong response to caged American mink (Neovison vison) (visual and olfactory stimuli), although they avoided the area with the mink, indicating a certain level of recognition. High intensity threats were simulated by staging attacks from aerial (goshawk, Accipiter gentilis) and aquatic predators (northern pike). The aerial attack made ducklings dive and scatter under water, whereas the response to attack by pike was to run on the water and scatter in different directions. The lack of response to a 'passive' pike and the rather weak avoidance of mink indicate that olfactory cues are not as important in identifying a potential predatory threat by ducklings as are auditory cues. Visual cues appear to be of little importance unless they are combined with movement, and a clear response is only triggered when the intensity of predator threat is high. Mallard ducklings, thus, show an innate capacity to adjust anti-predator behaviour to different predator types and to threat intensity. Our study highlights the general trade-off between foraging needs and predator avoidance, but also second-order trade-offs in which innate avoidance behaviour towards one type of predator may increase predation risk from another."

It is assumed that the prey has defensive switching property of predation-avoidance which call be characterized by two parameters: the relative alertness of the prey against a predator, u. and the intensity of defensive switching, n. Assuming that the system is encountered with another immigrant prey with altered defensive switching parameters one after another. the conditions of replacement of the former occupant prey by an immigrant are studied. It is shown that the system eventually attains the evolutionarily stable state such that no entry of an immigrant prey possible. Unless some trade-off relation exists between u and n, the evolutionarily stable state is not unique, but it is given by a set of parameters (u, n) which form it curve designated ''ESS line. Thus, it is seen that if a number of two-predator and one-prey systems are allowed to evolve independently, each system will reach a different state on the ESS line. Finally, we discuss a strategy that leads to optimal (minimum) prey consumption by both predators in relation to the ESS line. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Carr, Jennie M.; Lima, Steven L.",Heat-conserving postures hinder escape: a thermoregulation-predation trade-off in wintering birds,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,23,434,441,10.1093/beheco/arr208,2012,"Wintering birds may conserve body heat by adopting postures with minimal leg exposure or significant ptiloerection. However, maximally heat-conserving postures may hinder a bird's ability to escape attack, leading to a trade-off between predation risk and thermoregulation. Such a trade-off implies that birds should use the most heat-conserving postures only at very cold temperatures. Feeding in a relatively low-risk environment should also facilitate the use of such heat-conserving postures. In this experiment, we examined the effect of thermoregulatory postures on the time to initiate escape in feeding dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) exposed to a sudden sharp noise. Birds using progressively more heat-conserving postures required significantly more time to initiate flight, with a 50% increase or more for certain cumbersome postures when compared with the most flight-ready posture. This increase in the time needed to become airborne likely leads to an increase in the predation risk during an attack. Although this increase in risk could not be quantified, the delays associated with the most heat-conserving postures could allow a hawk to approach approximately 1.7 m closer to its prey during an attack. Postures that limit escape were used to a greater degree when feeding near cover and in cold conditions, lending additional support to a predation-thermoregulation trade-off. However, the effect of flock size was inconsistent and no effect of the nearest neighbor distance on thermoregulatory posture was detected. Overall, the results of this study provide insight into the seemingly intuitive observation that birds use maximally heat-conserving postures only under very cold winter conditions."

In imprinting experiments, ducklings are usually tested individually. However, testing ducklings individually does not allow researchers to test for the potential role of social dynamics in the formation of attachments. We describe a procedure for testing ducklings as a brood and report four experiments in which we tested this method. In the first experiment, we exposed experimental broods consisting of 10 mallard ducklings to a stimulus brood of three ducklings or three empty quadrants. The experimental broods preferred the stimulus brood more than the empty quadrants. In the second experiment, we exposed experimental broods to stimulus broods of three and nine ducklings and two empty quadrants. The stimulus brood of nine was preferred more than the other quadrants. The third and fourth experiments examined preferences for even larger stimulus broods and the effect of using a larger testing platform on the preferences shown. These experiments suggest an effective method for testing the preferences and developmental dynamics of broods of ducklings. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We studied the effects of trophy hunting on the flight behaviour of impala (Aepyceros melampus), greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and sable (Hippotragus niger) in two closed ecosystems, Cawston Ranch (hunting area) and Stanley and Livingstone Private Game Reserve (tourist area), western Zimbabwe. Using standardized field procedures, we assessed the flight behavioural responses of the three species in two seasons: non-hunting (December-March) and hunting (April-November) between March 2013 and November 2014. We tested the effect of habitat, group size, sex, season, start distance and alert distance on flight initiation distance using linear mixed models. Habitat, group size sex and alert distance did not have any effect on flight initiation distance for the three species. The three species were more alert and displayed longer flight initiation distances in the hunting area compared with the tourist area. Flight initiation distances for the three species were higher during the hunting season for the hunting area and low during the non-hunting season. Flight distances of the three species did not differ between the hunting area and the tourist area. We concluded that trophy hunting increased perceived risk of wild ungulates in closed hunting areas, whereas ungulates in non-hunting areas are less responsive and somehow habituated to human presence. Management plans should include minimum approach distances by tourists as well as establishing seasonal restrictions on special zones to promote species viability. Research aimed at integrating behavioural responses with physiological aspects of target species should be promoted to ensure that managers are able to deal with the behavioural trade-offs of trophy hunting at local and regional scale."

The central control (programmed grooming) model proposes that animals engage in preventive tick-defense grooming in response to an internal timing mechanism, even in the absence of peripheral stimulation from parasites. This model predicts that smaller animals will groom more frequently than larger ones because of the higher cost of parasitism for a small animal (body size principle). The peripheral stimulation (stimulus driven) model predicts no size-related differences in grooming rate in the absence of tick bite irritation. We observed grooming behavior in a Chihuahuan desert population of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana), where ticks have been absent for perhaps thousands of years. Although not exposed to ticks, bighorns self groomed by means of oral and scratch grooming, albeit at very low rates compared to size-matched ungulates in both tick-infested and tick-free environments. Logistic regression and general linear models revealed both the probability that grooming was performed during a 10-min focal sample and the rate of grooming when it occurred was greater for younger, smaller age/sex categories of less body mass. Oral and scratch grooming were negatively associated with body mass during both years, with juveniles (X = 15 kg) grooming the most frequently and the oldest males (X = 70-85 kg) grooming the least. Assuming that programmed grooming evolved in a tick-infested environment, the current grooming behavior of this population is a relict of their ancestral environment, an adaptation to the ghost of parasites past."

While foraging, animals should alter usage within or between sites to balance the benefits of feeding with the costs of predation. I tested how the distribution of food abundance and predation danger interacts to explain spatial usage (i.e. distance from shore) by migratory western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) at Boundary Bay, British Columbia, Canada, during northward and southward migrations. At Boundary Bay there are opposing spatial gradients in the distribution of food abundance and safety from predators. Predation danger for sandpipers is high near the shoreline where there is approach cover for falcons and decreases with distance from shore. Food abundance for sandpipers declines as distance from the shoreline increases. Food and danger attributes at Boundary Bay also differ temporally, such that food abundance is higher during southward migration, and predation danger is higher during northward migration. The spatial usage by western sandpipers balances the tradeoff between the opposing spatial gradients in food and safety. For both migratory periods spatial usage of the mudflat by sandpipers is highest at distances from the shoreline where food abundance and predation danger are intermediate. During the northward migration sandpiper usage is highest between 150 and 500 m from the shoreline, and during the southward migration sandpiper usage is highest between 100 and 600 m from the shoreline. Despite temporal differences in food and danger attributes, spatial usage of the site by sandpipers does not differ between migratory periods. Understanding how the distribution of food abundance and predation danger interact to affect the within site usage by shorebirds has important implications for assessments of site quality."

To evaluate the effect of location and habitat on carcass use and longevity, between December 1996 and April 2008 we recorded 870 observations of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Common Ravens (Corvus corax) and coyotes (Canis latrans) scavenging 123 ungulate carcasses: 103 elk (Carvus canadensis), 12 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), seven pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana), and one domestic cow (Bos taurus). Our temporal metric for measuring carcass longevity and scavenger presence was carcass-day (CD), numbered consecutively from the first day a carcass was recorded until it was consumed. We observed 38 separate carcasses (individual placement), 39 carcasses as part of three-carcass arrays in habitat associated with open, edge, and forest cover types (simultaneous choice), 22 carcasses left along the roadway where killed (monitored in place), and 24 carcasses partially skinned and/or cut open (facilitated). Elk carcasses lasted a mean 11.9 d (range 3-11), with 60% consumed during the first wk. Deer and pronghorn lasted 5.5 d (range 3-12) and 3.0 d (range 2-4), respectively. Ravens normally arrived by CD 3, Bald Eagles by CD 4, and coyotes by CD 6. Bald Eagles relied on ravens for discovery and sentinel duties, whereas both species depended on coyotes for accessibility. Winter- and road-killed carrion, not canine predation, drove carcass availability. Bald Eagles and coyotes used natural carrion more than human-influenced (road-killed or cut-open) carcasses, whereas Common Ravens were uninhibited by the latter. Removing ungulate carcasses from highway rights-of-way and partially opening them will promote quicker carcass consumption and safer avian scavenging by reducing potential for collisions with passing vehicles. A better understanding of the use of road-killed, large ungulate carrion may facilitate managing this supplemental food source as potential mitigation for other anthropogenic threats to both Bald and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), including wind-energy development."

Evaluation of these strategies will require accurate and high-throughput methods of predicting mosquito age. We previously developed an age prediction assay for individual Ae. aegypti females based on the transcriptional profiles of a selection of age responsive genes. Here we conducted field testing of the method on Ae. aegypti that were entirely uncaged and free to engage in natural behavior. Methodology/Principal Findings: We produced ''free-range'' test specimens by releasing 8007 adult Ae. aegypti inside and around an isolated homestead in north Queensland, Australia, and recapturing females at two day intervals. We applied a TaqMan probe-based assay design that enabled high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR of four transcripts from three age- responsive genes and a reference gene. An age prediction model was calibrated on mosquitoes maintained in small sentinel cages, in which 68.8% of the variance in gene transcription measures was explained by age. The model was then used to predict the ages of the free-range females. The relationship between the predicted and actual ages achieved an R2 value of 0.62 for predictions of females up to 29 days old. Transcriptional profiles and age predictions were not affected by physiological variation associated with the blood feeding/egg development cycle and we show that the age grading method could be applied to differentiate between two populations of mosquitoes having a two-fold difference in mean life expectancy. Conclusions/Significance: The transcriptional profiles of age responsive genes facilitated age estimates of near-wild Ae. aegypti females. Our age prediction assay for Ae. aegypti provides a useful tool for the evaluation of mosquito control interventions against dengue where mosquito survivorship or lifespan reduction are crucial to their success. The approximate cost of the method was US$7.50 per mosquito and 60 mosquitoes could be processed in 3 days. The assay is based on conserved genes and modified versions are likely to support similar investigations of several important mosquito and other disease vectors."

We examined the relationships between prelaying behavior, food handling and consumption rates, and the timing of breeding of female Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in suburban and wildland habitats. Scrub-jays in suburban habitats had access to ad libitum human-provided foods; wildland jays did not. During both years of this study, suburban scrub-jays bred earlier than their wildland counterparts. Wildland scrub-jays bred earlier in 1997 than in 1996, but the timing of breeding by suburban scrub-jays did not vary between years. Suburban scrub-jays spent less time foraging and more time perching than wildland jays. They handled more food per hour and per foraging hour, suggesting their foraging was more efficient. Despite this, food consumption rates did not differ between the two habitats. Neither time spent foraging or perching nor food consumption rates significantly influenced variation in time of breeding among individuals. Time of breeding was significantly influenced by site, year, and rate of food handling. Individuals that handled more food items per foraging hour, that is, those individuals that were most efficient, were the earliest breeders in both habitats. These results suggest that foraging efficiency increases with access to human-provided food and that resource predictability may be a perceptual cue for the appropriate timing of breeding."

Here, we jointly analyse a large record of in situ and satellite-derived observations, including a long-term time series of surface water height (SWH) from radar altimetry (a total of 2311 virtual stations) and surface water extent (SWE) from a multi-satellite technique, to characterize the CRB surface hydrology and its variability. First, we show that SWH from altimetry multi-missions agrees well with in situ water stage at various locations, with the root mean square deviation varying from 10 cm (with Sentinel-3A) to 75 cm (with European Remote Sensing satellite-2). SWE variability from multi-satellite observations also shows a plausible behaviour over a similar to 25-year period when evaluated against in situ observations from the subbasin to basin scale. Both datasets help to better characterize the large spatial and temporal variability in hydrological patterns across the basin, with SWH exhibiting an annual amplitude of more than 5 m in the northern subbasins, while the Congo River main stream and Cuvette Centrale tributaries vary in smaller proportions (1.5 to 4.5 m). Furthermore, SWH and SWE help illustrate the spatial distribution and different timings of the CRB annual flood dynamic and how each subbasin and tributary contribute to the hydrological regime at the outlet of the basin (the Brazzaville/Kinshasa station), including its peculiar bimodal pattern. Across the basin, we estimate the time lag and water travel time to reach the Brazzaville/Kinshasa station to range from 0-1 month in its vicinity in downstream parts of the basin and up to 3 months in remote areas and small tributaries. Northern subbasins and the central Congo region contribute highly to the large peak in December-January, while the southern part of the basin supplies water to both hydrological peaks, in particular to the moderate one in April-May. The results are supported using in situ observations at several locations in the basin. Our results contribute to a better characterization of the hydrological variability in the CRB and represent an unprecedented source of information for hydrological modelling and to study hydrological processes over the region."

MPAs have the potential to sustain living marine resources and their support systems at genetic, population-community, ecosystem, and landscape levels. From a fisheries perspective they can protect spawning and nursery areas of key species, maintain age structure (retain older, proportionately more fecund individuals), protect key habitats, and reduce bycatch. MPAs are used sporadically in management of fisheries and are generally based on predicted responses for populations of exploited taxa. However, identification of representative, rare, and high diversity areas of temperate and boreal marine systems, especially on outer continental shelves, is still in its infancy. There is information available from both the scientific literature and from fishers on the life history and behavior of economically important species, on species assemblage patterns, and on physical structure of the marine environment. Such information could be used as a starting point for identifying areas of particular importance to populations or communities of fishes and for the conservation of diversity at the regional scale. Identification of such areas could serve as a basis to design an experimental network of MPAs. Such MPAs, designated for the purpose of maintaining or developing sustainable fisheries, must explicitly be designed within an experimental context, maintaining flexibility for changes in regulations as new information becomes available. Monitoring change in exploited and non-target populations (intra- and inter-guild), habitat complexity indices, and diversity of sentinel taxa (for assessing maintenance of diversity) will be needed to provide feedback to assess the efficacy of MPAs and to recommend changes in the regulatory framework."

Cooperative predator defense can enhance nest success and adult survival but, because it is inherently risky, dynamic risk assessment theory predicts that individuals modify defense behavior according to the risk posed by the predator. Parental investment theory, on the other hand, predicts that reproductive payoffs (brood value) determine investment in nest defense. We propose that, in cooperative breeders, fitness benefits deriving from the survival of other group members may additionally influence defense behavior (social group benefits theory). We tested predictions of these theories in the cooperatively breeding purple-crowned fairy-wren, Malurus coronatus, where brood value is higher for breeders, but social group benefits more important for helpers. We recorded experimentally induced individual defense behaviors in response to predator models presented near nests, representing differing levels of threat to nests and adults. As predicted, 1) individuals engaged in less risky defenses when encountering a more dangerous predator (dynamic risk assessment theory); 2) individuals defended older broods more often, and breeders defended more than helpers (parental investment theory); and 3) helpers were more likely to respond to a predator of adults (social group benefits theory). Our findings highlight that predator defense in cooperative breeders is complex, shaped by the combination of immediate risk and multiple benefits."

The role of 2 abiotic stimuli, light and gravity, were examined in the dispersal and transmission of the cercariae of Echinostoma caproni in a laboratory setting. Nearly 100% of cercariae placed in a vertical chamber that permitted upward migration with a marginal probability of return swam to the surface in both light and dark conditions, suggesting that a positive phototaxis is not involved in dispersal and that a negative geotaxis may be the critical component in the vertical migration. The presence of a sentinel snail (Biomphalaria glabrata) in the bottom portion of the transmission chamber resulted in a significant reduction of cercariae dispersing upward and a significantly higher intensity of metacercariae in snails under lighted conditions than in the dark. In a light/dark choice experiment the prevalence and intensity of metacercariae was significantly higher in snails in the dark. The results suggest that although a positive phototaxis is not important in the dispersal of E. caproni cercariae, a negative phototaxis enhances host finding and transmission of cercariae to snails functioning as the second intermediate host."

Players are assigned to be first or second movers randomly and with the same probability. We found that both a synergistic effect of cooperation (i.e., cooperative effort is better than the sum of the individual efforts) and population structure (low dispersal, spatial confinement, or group formation) are crucial for mutual cooperation to emerge. Otherwise, only one of the players will carry the burden of cooperation."

However, individuals within the group vary in the intensity and frequency of defence. To date little is known about how sex, body size and social status interact with the degree of threat to influence defence activities. To this end, we experimentally manipulated the need for defence in wild groups of the cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher by exposing social groups to four intruder types representing different forms of threat. Intruders were introduced singly (experiment 1) to assess the costs and benefits associated with defence and in tandem (experiment 2) to assess how individuals prioritize perceived threats. Dominant breeders defended more than subordinate helpers, females were more aggressive than males, and female breeders defended more than any other individual in the group. Individual body size, or the difference in body size between intruders and defenders, had no influence on the frequency of defence. Dominant male breeders defended most vigorously against threats to their dominance position, while dominant female breeders showed the highest defence rates to both threats to their position and the security of young to a similar degree relative to all others. Predators evoked the strongest defence responses by subordinate helpers, and conspecific intruders evoked the weakest responses relative to all other intruder types. The results suggest that both costs and benefits have shaped aggressive defence patterns in this cooperatively breeding teleost fish. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However a growing body of research has particularly unsuspected levels of social complexity and diversity in mating systems within the squamate lineage, revealed unsuspected levels of social complexity and diversity in mating systems particularly among the members of the Australian Scineid genus Egernia. Several species of Egernia are amongst the most highly social of all squamate reptiles, exihibiting stable social aggregations and high levels of long-term social and genetic monogamy. Social complexity is widespread within the Egernia genus, with reports of social aggregations in 23 of the 30 described species. The purpose of this review was to examine the potential for the Egernia genus as a model system for study of the evolution of sociality and monogamy within squamate reptiles.Current evidence indicates there is substantial variability in social complexity both within and between species, with social organization covering the spectrum from solitary to highly social. Four highly social Egernia species are known to live in stable social aggregations consisting of closely related individuals (adults. subadults, juveniles; i.e., 'familly' groups) that appear to utilize chemical cues to recognize group members (kin recognition). Enhanced vigilance against predators is one presumed benefit of group membership. Additionally, juveniles within social grouping appear to recieve low levels of indirect parental care. Several Egernia species create scat piles that mark group territories. Three Egernia species exhibit long-term social and genetic monogamy and several inbreeding avoidance strategies have been documented. However, it is currently unknown whether monogamy is widespread within Egernia.Egernia species occupy a broad range of habitats, although most are terrestrial, saxicolous or semi-arboreal. Several species display an attachment to it permanent home site, generally a rock crevice, burrow or tree hollow. Egernia species take 2-5 years to mature, live for 5-25 years, and are viviparous with litter size positively correlated with body size. Several Egernia species are herbivorous, with the degree of herbivory increasing with body size and during ontogeny in larger species. Most smaller species are either insectivorous or omnivorous. Species of Egernia have it wide range of reptilian, avian, and mammalian predators. Several larger species possess several behavioral and morphological features to prevent their extraction from rock crevices, including highly modified keeled scales and numerous defensive behaviors. Color pattern polymorphism is present ill five Egernia species.Potential ecological correlates of sociality and monogamy are discussed. The life-history hypothesis predicts long-lived, late-maturing species should evolve complex sociality. The habitat availabiliy hypothesis relies on the assumption that refugia may be limited in some ecological settings and group formation is it consequence of co-habitation of available refugia. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and testable predictions are formulated and discussed. Specific future research directions are outlined to take advantage of Egernia as it model system for comparative research oil a lineage that represents all independent origin of social organization comparable to that found in birds and mammals."
"Bleich, VC",Mountain sheep and coyotes: Patterns of predator evasion in a mountain ungulate,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,80,283,289,10.2307/1383228,1999,"I used retrospective analyses to investigate relationships among terrain type, reactions of prey, and age and sex of prey and outcomes of encounters between mountain sheep (Ovis canadensis) and coyotes (Canis latrans). Adult females fled from coyotes more often when in open terrain and young always fled regardless of type of terrain. Young were less likely to survive encounters with coyotes than were adults, and no adult females were killed by coyotes. When types of terrain were: pooled, females were more apt to flee than were males, but no difference existed in proportion of females and young that fled. When terrain type and sex of adults were pooled, no difference in survival existed between adults that fled and those that did not. When coyotes were encountered in open terrain, female mountain sheep fled more frequently than did female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Ungulates less dependent on terrain for predator evasion than are mountain sheep may employ a more plastic strategy than artiodactyls inhabiting precipitous terrain."
"Ruckstuhl, KE",To synchronise or not to synchronise: a dilemma for young bighorn males?,BEHAVIOUR,136,805,818,10.1163/156853999501577,1999,"Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are sexually dimorphic and live in nursery groups, bachelor or mixed groups. To remain in a group, individuals have to synchronise their activity according to the type of group they are in, which may incur a cost for individuals of different body size from the other group members. To test this hypothesis, I calculated the degree of synchrony of activities for each individual within a group. Animals in nursery or bachelor groups were highly synchronised with each other while mixed-age-sex groups had the lowest group synchronisation index. Two and three-year old bighorn males are intermediate in body size between the two adult sexes. Two-year-old males always adjusted their behaviour independent of group type, while three-year-old males synchronised their behaviour when with bachelor, but less so when in nursery groups. I suggest that two- and three year-old males may face a conflict between synchronising their behaviour to stay in a group and the need to forage according to their own time budgets. I conclude that intermediate-sized young male ungulates of sexually dimorphic species may be better off forming same-sex-age groups."
"Rice, DC",Relationship between measures of exposure to PCBs/dioxins and behavioral effects in recent developmental studies,HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT,7,1059,1077,10.1080/20018091094853,2001,"Epidemiological studies on the neurodevelopmental effects of exposure to PCBs initiated in the last decade have had the opportunity to take advantage of modern methodologies for the analysis of congeners of PCBs, dioxins, and related organochlorine compounds. Each of these studies is a longitudinal prospective study, in which women were recruited during pregnancy and the children are being followed for at least several years after birth. The study from which the largest body of data has been published to date is being performed in the Netherlands, in which exposure to PCBs and related compounds is through the general food supply. Mother-infant pairs were recruited in two cities. Half of the infants were bottle-fed and half breast-fed in each city. Four PCB congeners (118, 138, 153, 180) were assessed in maternal and cord plasma, breast milk, and plasma of the child at 3.5 years. TEQ in breast milk was calculated based on PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs. Various measures of in utero exposure were associated with suboptimal neurological status during infancy, whereas maternal plasma PCB concentration was associated with cognitive deficits (Kaufman scores) at 3.5 years of age. The child's concurrent plasma PCB levels and maternal PCB plasma levels independently predicted performance on various aspects of a vigilance task, and maternal and cord plasma levels predicted impairment of complex play behavior. Poor scores on behavioral ratings were associated with concurrent blood PCB concentrations in the child. A study in Oswego in Lake Ontario fish eaters includes mothers who never ate Great Lakes fish and mothers who consumed greater than 40 PCB-equivalent pounds of Lake Ontario fish over their lifetime. Sixty-eight PCB congeners were measured in cord blood. Suboptimal neurological status during infancy was associated with maternal fish consumption and highly chlorinated cord PCB levels, whereas deficits in short-term memory at 6 months and 1 year of age were associated with total chlorinated cord PCB levels. In a study in Germany of 171 mother-infant pairs, PCB congeners 138, 153, and 180 were measured in cord plasma and milk 2 weeks after birth; both measures are considered markers of in utero exposure. Suboptimal neurological status during infancy, decrements in Bayley scores at 30 months and Kaufman scores at 42 months were associated with PCBs in milk but not cord plasma. These studies, combined with data from previous studies, reveal a consistent relationship between PCB exposure and suboptimal neurological status during infancy, and cognitive deficits associated with in utero exposure. Data from the Dutch study revealed effects on other behavioral domains associated with concurrent (postnatal) exposure. Although it is not possible to identify specific congeners or groups of congeners that may be responsible for the neurotoxic effects observed in these studies, the TEQ approach was not particularly predictive for neurotoxic outcomes."
"Hamilton, Katelyn; Goulet, Celine T.; Johnstone, Christopher P.; Chapple, David G.",Does geographical isolation influence group recognition and social preference in an invasive lizard?,JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,310,246,253,10.1111/jzo.12738,2020,"The formation of aggregations is fundamental to animal organization and has been shown to confer an evolutionary advantage. Conspecific attraction often prompts the formation of social groups yet not all individuals are equally attracted to others of their own species. The decision to aggregate with or avoid a particular individual is based upon class-specific signals that serve to differentiate among members and non-members. Given that signal divergence may be driven by local adaptation, disjunct populations could potentially have evolved distinct recognition systems adapted to their own ecological conditions. Several studies have shown that individuals of a species are capable of discriminating between such classes as sex, mate, kin, and familiar. Yet research exploring conspecific attraction between populations is lacking. Invasive species offer a unique opportunity to determine the consequences of geographic isolation on recognition systems and social preferences, as these genetically distinct native-range source populations have the potential to undergo secondary contact within the invaded region. To this end, we used an invasive lizard species, the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata), to investigate conspecific recognition and attraction among individuals from two identified source populations that vary both genetically and morphologically. Our results of the dichotomous choice tests indicate that L. delicata did not differ in the level of social attraction expressed towards individuals from either population. It is unclear whether these findings are due to an inability to discriminate between local and foreign lizards using visual cues or instead that attraction is not based upon an individual's population origin but rather some other factor such as thermoregulatory requirements. Understanding the role that conspecific attraction plays in the invasion process will enable us to better predict the impacts of biological invasions. Future studies should consider using other sensory modalities and investigate the physiological benefit of grouping."

In line with previous meta-analytic research, results indicate that sleep and work performance have a positive relationship. However, more importantly, results from moderator analyses reveal that the type of sleep measurement (sleep quantity and sleep quality), work performance measurement (task performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and counterproductive work behavior), analysis method (between-person and within-person), sleep report source (self-report, other report, and objective), sleep recall window (day, week/month, and more than 1 month), and study setting (field and laboratory) differentially influence the strength of the sleep-work performance relationship. Furthermore, meta-analytic SEM results indicate that certain mediators (affect, job attitudes, and cognitive resources) provide stronger explanations (i.e., stronger indirect effects) for the relationship between sleep and work performance, depending on the specific type of performance being examined. In general, results highlight the importance of construct operationalization and methodology decisions when conducting sleep-work performance research and provide greater insight into explanations for the relationship between sleep and work performance. Research implications, practical implications, potential limitations, and future directions are also discussed."

This coordination can be disturbed by anthropogenic noise, which has been shown to alter vocal signal production in many species of birds. In addition to affecting senders, noise may also alter reception and behavioral response. Here we investigated the effects of anthropogenic noise on behavioral response to acoustic signals in mixed-species flocks of songbirds. We used playbacks of Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) chick-a-dee calls and local anthropogenic noise to determine how receivers respond to calls with and without added noise. We found that the addition of noise caused a significant decrease of similar to 80% in the number of birds that approached the speaker during a chick-a-dee call playback; however, we saw no effect of noise on feeding behavior. Our data support the hypothesis that anthropogenic noise can alter behavioral responses to chick-a-dee calls. This finding is of particular concern because chick-a-dee calls are given in response to a threatening stimulus. If receivers are slow to respond to these warnings, they may be unable to take advantage of the warning."

Animals that use an auditory alarm calling system are an important indirect information source for eavesdropping individuals in their environments. We investigated whether Western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) nesting on black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies responded to broadcasts of prairie dog alarm calls. Western burrowing owls are closely associated with black-tailed prairie dogs in Colorado and neighboring states on the Great Plains of the United States. Prairie dog burrows in active colonies can serve as nesting sites for Western burrowing owls, and prairie dogs may act as an alternative prey source for predators, potentially decreasing the burrowing owls' risk of predation through the dilution effect. Burrowing owls nesting on prairie dog colonies may also eavesdrop on prairie dog alarm calls, enhancing their survival and nesting success on prairie dog colonies. We performed broadcast experiments with three different sounds: a prairie dog alarm call, a biological control (cattle mooing), and a non-biological control (an airplane engine), and characterized burrowing owl responses as either alert or relaxed. For each sound stimulus, we recorded the time to first alert response to broadcast sounds (latency) and also how frequently the target burrowing owl exhibited an alert response within the first ten seconds of the broadcast (intensity). Burrowing owls reacted more quickly to the prairie dog alarm than to the biological control. They significantly increased the intensity of alert behaviors in response to broadcasts of the alarm, but did not show an increased reaction to either the biological or the non-biological control. Our results suggest that burrowing owls nesting on prairie dog colonies eavesdrop on, and increase their alert behaviors in response to, prairie dog alarm calls."

The present study emphasises the wealth of information obtained from studying a remnant population of a medium-sized ungulate, the impala (Aepyceros melampus), on degraded rangelands in Rwanda. Compared with impala occurring under similar climatic conditions in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the study population showed a marked reduction in daytime activity, absence of a mid-day resting phase, and a slight increase in activity towards the late afternoon. This pattern was not directly correlated with daily variation in human activity. It is argued that hunting/poaching leads impala to seek shelter to such a degree that any daytime rhythmicity in activity patterns is lost and that increased afternoon activity reflects a shifted cost-benefit ratio of hiding versus foraging, as hungry individuals are more likely to take risks. Indeed, impala were more likely to encounter cattle herds and their herdsmen towards the afternoon. The study augments understanding of behavioural flexibility, potential for habituation and adaptation to human-induced habitat alterations in impala and highlights a possible function of rangelands as dispersal corridors for African wildlife populations."

However, the resulting distributions of animals may depend on which components of foraging success contribute to interference. We examined the effect of group size (1-13 birds) on the prey encounter rates, handling times, and foraging rates of house sparrows, Passer domesticus, feeding at three seed densities in a suburban backyard. House sparrows did not experience interference during search. Interference arose primarily front foraging time lost handling seeds. Foraging rates decreased with increasing seed density as a consequence of increased handling times. Also, birds experiencing significant increases in handling time with group size suffered most from interference. Our results suggest that animals adjust handling time to avoid costly aggressive interactions, indicating that handling time may be an important component of interference in some foraging systems. Future studies estimating interference should try to identify which components of foraging contribute to interference, paying particular attention to handling times for species that monitor and avoid competitors."

Responses of eastern grey kangaroos to cattle,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,26,215,225,10.1071/WR95037,1999,"The instantaneous behavioural and spatial responses of eastern grey kangaroos to the presence of cattle were studied at Wallaby Creek, north-eastern New South Wales. Kangaroo groups were distributed closer to cattle groups than would be expected by chance, both at a study-site scale (154-ha) and at a 1-ha scale; large males were recorded on average further from cattle than were smaller males. Nearest-neighbouring kangaroo groups were located such that cattle groups rarely interrupted the lines of sight between them. Observed disturbance and displacement by cattle provoked a minimal response in kangaroos, which fled only tens of metres and soon resumed their previous activity. The presence of cattle had few detectable instantaneous effects on the behaviour of the kangaroos, except to increase their alertness and the feeding time of small (but not large) kangaroo groups. These effects indicate that cattle pose little threat to kangaroos."

There was no significant difference between the two species with respect to the pattern of time spent grazing between plots, but parma wallabies tended to visit ungrazed plots more frequently than tammar wallabies.When offered carrot pieces of different dimensions both species preferred carrot pieces of greater mass, regardless of shape. Both species favoured eating in the upright (bipedal) position despite the fact that the use of this position prolonged search time between bites.Although the two species are able to forage optimally when grazing, the greater efficiency of the bipedal posture in predator avoidance may result in the selection of larger food items whenever possible."

We predicted that the higher predation pressure in one of the roosts would be reflected in larger and more compact flocks, thought to be less vulnerable to predation than small flocks. Incoming flocks, not under direct attack, were observed during winter for 53 days. We identified 12 flocking shapes. Significantly higher frequencies of compact and large flocks were observed in the roost with high predation pressure, while small flocks and singletons were more frequent at the roost with low predation pressure. Similar patterns were observed in both roosts when other flocks displayed antipredator behaviour, even when far away and in the absence of the predator at the focal roost. This may indicate that social information passed between flocks affects flocking decisions. Predation success was higher at the roost with low predation. These results suggest that aerial flocking patterns are affected by predation risk and possibly by the behaviour of other flocks in response to direct attacks.

"CASSINI, MH",FORAGING UNDER PREDATION RISK IN THE WILD GUINEA-PIG CAVIA-APEREA,OIKOS,62,20,24,10.2307/3545441,1991,"Four hypotheses about the foraging-antipredation behavioural conflict using herbivorous rodents Cavia aperea were tested: (a) shorter residence times and (b) greater scanning rates, are expected in foraging areas progressively more distant from cover, because foraging at greater distances from cover would increment predation risk; as group foraging would facilitate predator detection, (c) shorter residence times and (d) greater scanning rates, are expected when cavies are alone than when they are in foraging groups. Over a total of 123 complete foraging bout observations, cavies always foraged at less than four m from the cover. The results support predictions (c) and (d), suggesting that (1) cavies improved their foraging efficiency by joining a group, which allowed them to produce longer bouts and to invest more time in grazing during bouts, and (2) foraging group formation had a role in antipredation defense. (b) was also supported, but in the case of (a), the observed relation was the opposite to the one expected, that is residence times were longer as distance to cover increased. Observed behaviour suggests that cavies reduce risk at greater distance to the cover by increasing their scanning rates and by progressively reaching more distant zones, foraging first in near ones, and returning to the cover in a hurry."
"MULDER, RS; WILLIAMS, TD; COOKE, F","DOMINANCE, BROOD SIZE AND FORAGING BEHAVIOR DURING BROOD-REARING IN THE LESSER SNOW GOOSE - AN EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY",CONDOR,97,99,106,10.2307/1368987,1995,"We investigated the relationship between brood size and social dominance during the brood-rearing period in Lesser Snow Geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) by experimentally manipulating food availability to create high-biomass food patches. A total of 128 social interactions were subsequently observed in experimental areas; the rate of interactions was significantly higher in experimental high-biomass plots (9.6 hr(-1)) than in control, low-biomass, areas (0.4 hr(-1)).During social interactions families (pairs with one or more goslings) were always dominant over pairs without goslings. However, there was no clear dominance hierarchy among families in relation to brood size. Neither aggressiveness (the number of interactions initiated) nor the proportion of successful interactions varied consistently with brood size. We conclude that, during brood rearing, dominance ranking is determined more by individual variation in aggressiveness of adult (parent) birds, rather than by any ''motivational'' effect of offspring or by brood size per se.Geese fed longer in the high biomass plots (mean 19.2 min per visit) than in control plots (2.9 min), and birds ''defended'' high biomass areas: 32% of all interactions involved a social unit inside the experimental plot driving off a social unit which was trying to enter the plot from outside. This suggests that geese derived benefits from monopolization of good quality food patches. The behavior of foraging geese varied in relation to food availability: birds took fewer steps per minute during both feeding and non-feeding bouts in the experimental plots and females, but not males, had shorter feeding bouts in experimental plots, i.e., they adopted the vigilant head-up posture more frequently. We suggest that the benefits of utilizing high biomass food patches during brood-rearing include higher intake rates, decreased energetic costs of foraging and reduced predation risk through increased vigilance behavior by parents and greater cohesion of the family unit."
"LIMA, SL",COLLECTIVE DETECTION OF PREDATORY ATTACK BY BIRDS IN THE ABSENCE OF ALARM SIGNALS,JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY,25,319,326,10.2307/3677279,1994,"Current treatments of collective detection hold that all members of the flock are alerted to predatory attack as long as at least one flock member detects it. This presumes that the individual(s) detecting attack somehow signal unambiguously that an attack is in progress. Alarm calls may provide such unambiguous signals, but for the many bird species lacking such calls, departures from the flock may be the main source of information on predator detection. These departures might themselves be considered alarm signals, but as such they are ambiguous, since departures may not be predator-driven. Thus non-detectors must decide whether to initiate escape behavior based upon the anti-predator information available in the departures. A mathematical exploration of this ''departure information'' reveals that multiple departures over a short time interval may be effectively required to sound the alarm in a flock. In fact, single detections (or departures) may usually go unheeded by other flock members. The information available to non-detectors in multiple departures varies considerably with the rate of non-predator-driven departures, attack rates, and flock size. In general, however, a good predator detection rule-of-thumb is likely to be: flee to safety with the simultaneous departures of two or more individuals, otherwise assess the reason for single departures before taking such action."

Habitat changes brought about by a mega-herbivore, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), can modify the perceived landscape of fear by predation vulnerable prey species (impala Aepyceros melampus and warthog Phacochoerus africctrius) in contrast with non-prey species (white rhinoceros Ceratotherium Atrium). We hypothesized that by opening up woody vegetation, elephants may modify perceived risk at a landscape-scale, but also at a fine scale by depositing escape impediments in the form of coarse woody debris. We experimentally tested this in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa, by simulating elephant-induced habitat changes on patch scale (opening up woody vegetation) and within-patch scale (deposition of coarse woody debris) and monitoring the herbivore visitation using camera traps. We compared visitation on the edge of grazing lawns (in proximity of dense vegetation) and the centre (open, highly visible patches), either with or without coarse woody debris and with or without fresh predator scat. We found that mesoherbivore prey species showed contrasting responses, with warthog avoiding plots close to dense vegetation and plots with coarse woody debris. Impala reduced their visitation to dense vegetation patches only during risky times, at night, especially in the presence of predator scat, but did not clearly avoid plots with coarse woody debris. Our study indicates that, in African savannas, the perceived landscape of fear is a highly dynamic phenomenon varying in both space and time and being species-specific. Elephant induced habitat changes may shape landscapes of fear in complex and contrasting ways."
"Cowlishaw, G",Alarm calling and implications for risk perception in a desert baboon population,ETHOLOGY,103,384,394,,1997,"Patterns of alarm calling and their implications for perceived predation risk were explored among adult baboons Papio cynocephalus ursinus in four social groups differing in both size and composition (22-55 members with one to six adult males) in a desert population. Data were collected in a held experiment where alarm calls were elicited from baboons under similar conditions of risk in response to the approach of a potential predator, a human observer. The results show that females call more frequently than males in most groups. In addition, the median calling rate of females shows an exponential increase in smaller groups. These patterns suggest that females in small groups may perceive the highest risk in this population. Nevertheless, there was no clear tendency for either sex to be the first to call. The observer approaches were also used to evaluate the influence of group size on the ease of detection of 1. the baboons by the observer; and 2. the observer by the baboons. Group size did not appear to affect detection distances for either subject, although the probability that baboons were more likely to perform alarm calls before the observer had detected them increased in smaller groups."

A.",Behavioral responses of goitered gazelles to potential threats,MAMMAL RESEARCH,65,141,149,10.1007/s13364-019-00457-y,2020,"Prey species have to recognize a predator, assess its potential threat, and adjust its behavioral responses according to the magnitude of the perceived predation risk. In many studies of antipredator behavior in prey animals, simulated threats, such as human activities (movements, approaching prey), have been used as experimental threat factors, often in controlled circumstances, while prey responses to other animals in natural environments have been less investigated. This paper discusses the responses of goitered gazelles in the wild during encounters with various animals in their natural habitat to evaluate their cues used to assess the magnitude of potential threats. This study found that the goitered gazelles' behavioral responses to perceived risk differed across the various species sharing their habitat, with kulan recognized as a minimal threat and Siberian ibex the most threatening among ungulates. Among predators, the fox caused the least fear, while a horseman with a dog was identified as the greatest threat, with a wolf falling in between. Goitered gazelles adjusted their responses depending on the traits of the species encountered, while the features and conditions in their local environment played a less significant role. During encounters with other species, the gazelles ranked them according to their potential risk level based on the animal's appearance and behavior. The gazelles did distinguish between predators and other species and reacted to them differently: from pursuing and harassing the smallest (fox), to a panicky, running escape from their most dangerous natural predator (wolf), and especially from their most lethal, non-natural predator (herdsmen-mainly local poachers). Thus, this study suggested that goitered gazelles differentiate between predator species, assess their traits and intentions in each particular setting, and respond in the most advantageous way to each threat challenge."

An individual's fuel stores are considered in theory to directly dictate subsequent stopover behavior (e.g., extent of foraging or vigilance, when to depart), although such decisions at stopover must also consider atmospheric factors (e.g., wind, precipitation) that influence the energetic costs of migration. We conducted the first study to date that directly manipulated the fuel stores of newly arrived songbirds at a stopover site, evaluated their effect on movement behavior and departure decisions, and assessed how atmospheric factors mediated these behavioral decisions. Hermit thrushes (Catharus guttatus) captured during fall migration at a southern New England, USA, offshore island stopover site and subsequently released with increased fuel stores moved less and made more tortuous movements, were more likely to depart on a given night and regularly resumed migration earlier and in a seasonally appropriate direction relative to individuals released with little change in fuel stores. The importance of fuel stores in modifying behavioral decisions increased throughout the migration period, presumably in response to declining food abundance. Precipitation suppressed migrant movements during stopover and precluded departure. Migrants departed in light winds with little respect to wind direction. The pervasive influence of fuel stores on migrant stopover behavior underscores the central role of fuel acquisition in the dynamics, speed, and success of migration, as well as the importance of quality stopover sites to migratory birds.Songbirds typically punctuate migration with stopovers to rest and refuel. During stopover, migrants must balance finding food and staying safe, suggesting that fuel (fat) reserves govern behavioral priorities. We experimentally manipulated the fat stores of hermit thrushes newly arrived to a stopover site. Thrushes with larger fat stores moved less, resumed migration sooner, and used a more direct route than individuals with smaller fat stores; environmental conditions additionally modified thrush movements and departure decisions."
"How, TL; Bull, CM",Reunion vigour: an experimental test of the mate guarding hypothesis in the monogamous sleepy lizard (Tiliqua rugosa),JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,257,333,338,10.1017/S0952836902000936,2002,"The Australian sleepy lizard Tiliqua rugosa forms socially monogamous pair bonds for 6 to 8 weeks each spring before mating occurs. This behaviour could not be explained by any hypothesis involving mates helping to rear their young, because pairs split up soon after mating, and males seem to have no contact with the offspring of their partners. Short monogamous associations in other lizard species are often interpreted as mate guarding by the male to assure paternity. The mate guarding hypothesis was tested by experimental separation of pairs at various times during the pairing season. Data from 73 trials indicated that males were more likely to return to females than vice versa, and that the tendency of males to return to females increased as the time of mating approached. Also, reunion was more likely in pairs that had a greater tendency to remain together during the season. These results are consistent with predictions that the monogamous relationship is a form of mate guarding by males. However, the incidence of females reuniting with males, and the long duration of pair bonds before mating occurs are not predicted by a mate guarding hypothesis. There may be additional explanations for monogamous pairing in the sleepy lizard."

Juvenile mortality is a primary threat to the persistence of the single remaining Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi) population, which is found on Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Therefore, variation in foraging behavior among fledglings, sub-adults and adults may highlight different needs or susceptibilities that could inform age-specific management strategies. During observations of 36 Mariana Crows, we found that of all food captures, 14% were plant-based, 56% were insects or their larvae and eggs and 30% were non-insect animal prey. Two food categories, fruits/seeds/plants and ants/termites/larvae, which were procured and processed with simple behaviors, were taken more frequently by fledglings. Crabs, which were processed using complex behaviors, were captured more frequently by adults. Adults acquired more food items from the ground than did fledglings and sub-adult birds, a result that was driven by the former's high level of crab predation. We did not detect differences in foraging behavior between wet and dry seasons, suggesting that Mariana Crows maintain a similar diet year-round. Overall, our results highlight age-related differences in foraging behavior; however, future studies should identify whether these differences drive age-dependent variation in survivorship. Finally, we suggest that complex trophic interactions between non-native snails and Coenobita hermit crabs may have modified Mariana Crow foraging behavior, increasing their vulnerability to feral cat predation."

Among the types of predators that elicit mobbing, snakes seem to be one of the more consistent recipients of it. I describe the mobbing behavior of spectral tarsiers toward live and model snakes. In particular, I explore individual differences-sex, age and reproductive status-in mobbing behavior at Tangkoko Nature Reserve, Sulawesi, Indonesia. In 1994-1995, I observed 11 groups for 18 mo, and in 1999, I observed 9 groups for 6 mo. Over all I recorded, 11 natural mobbing events and 9 artificially induced mobbing events. The mean number of individuals at a natural mobbing is 5.1 with an average duration of 33 min. The duration of a mobbing event is strongly correlated with the number of mobbers. Adults were more likely than other age classes to participate in mobbings. Males were more likely than females to participate in mobbings. Mobbing groups often contained >1 adult male despite the fact that no spectral tarsier group contains >1 adult male. Vis-a-vis Curio's (1978) 9 hypotheses for the function of mobbing suggests that its primary function in spectral tarsiers may be perception advertisement or teaching snakes to move on."

MeSA is commercially sold as slow-release lures or as a spray. While MeSA application has increased the abundance of natural enemies in numerous food crops, its ability to reduce pests for crop protection is not as frequently demonstrated. Our first objective was to test MeSA lures in ornamental fields where few studies have been done, and monitor natural enemies, pests, and crop protection. A 2-year study in spruce container yards revealed more aphid parasitoids (Pseudopraon sp.), fewer aphids (Mindarus obliquus) on shoot tips, and less shoot tip damage in MeSA plots during the first year. A 2-year study in red maple fields revealed more predatory lady beetles and rove beetles, and parasitic Ceraphronidae, Diapriidae, and Chalcidoidea in one or both years with MeSA. Fewer pest thrips were also captured in MeSA plots, though it is not clear whether this was due to enhanced predation or reduced colonization. Maple growth as measured by stem diameter change did not differ with MeSA use. A 2-year study examining predation on sentinel Halyomorpha halys eggs in various mature ornamental stock blocks found no increase in predation except for 1 month, though green lacewings, lady beetles, and predatory thrips occurred more in MeSA plots in the first year. While MeSA is expected to enhance biological control by herding in natural enemies, the impacts that applied volatiles have on predator efficiency is mostly unknown. Thus, our second objective examined how volatiles would impact feeding rates at close-range. Adult carabid Pterostichus melanarius, adult coccinellids Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis, and larval lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris consumed their prey at similar rates in the presence/absence of MeSA when food was presented directly in a 28 cm(2) or 30 ml arena, or when foraging in a 520 cm(2) outdoor soil arena or 946 ml arena with aphids on leaves."

Our system consists of a multi-channel digital video recorder (DVR), active night vision cameras, a deep cycle marine battery, and a weatherproof housing. The major advantages of these systems over previous generations of video equipment include reduced expense, improved deployment times, faster frames per second, and higher video resolution. We tested our systems in a pair of experiments: the first assessed the effects of ground cover on predation of key pests in blueberries, and the second investigated predator activity in corn and perennial prairie systems. We identified ants as the most frequent predators in all three ecosystems, with notable activity from arachnids, crickets, and mollusks. Interactions between coleopterans and prey were surprisingly infrequent in all three agroecosystems. Ants were observed under both day and night conditions, while other predators were primarily nocturnal. Ground covers did not significantly affect predator activity in blueberries, but there was a numerical reduction in ant activity on woodchips and weed barrier compared to grass and bare ground. The predator complex observed in blueberry video footage differed considerably from pitfall captures at the same site. In corn fields, prey mortality significantly increased with ant activity, and high prey mortality was associated with long interactions that involved large numbers of ant foragers. Digital videography of insect predators is a very useful tool for identifying key taxa responsible for the removal of sentinel prey and documenting their behavior."

The wild boar (Sus scrofa) is one of the most common mammals in Europe and has notably expanded its distribution range in recent decades. The present work aimed to investigate the possible effect of wild boar rooting activity on butterflies in olive groves inside the Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni National Park. Butterflies were surveyed in five Rooted (R) and five Control areas (C). Transects were made from April to September in 2011 and 2012. Forty-three species and 3659 individuals were found, of which 39 species and 2426 individuals were detected in C areas and 31 species and 1233 individuals in R areas. A community-level approach showed a significantly higher abundance, richness and Shannon-Wiener index in C than in R. An ecological-level approach indicated that more specialised butterflies were significantly more affected by wild boar activity. Finally, the response of single species was investigated: two species (Colias croceus and Polyommatus icarus) were significantly more represented in R, whereas six species (Aricia agestis, Hipparchia statilinus, Lasiommata megera, Melanargia arge, Pyronia cecilia and Thymelicus acteon) were significantly more abundant in C. Three species considered at risk (M. arge; Annex II of Directive 92/43/EEC; H. statilinus and T. acteon: European Red List) were less represented in rooted areas. Overall, the intensive wild boar activity negatively correlated with butterflies in the olive groves studied."

This is reasonable because the ciliary strokes result in the intake of phytoplankton by raising the constant water current along the cilia from an inhalant siphon transported to the mouth. The ciliary strokes showed an evident diel fluctuation with the maximal activity during the night. The contribution of mucus excretion was evident for efficient filter-feeding. The ciliary stroke and the mucus excretion were activated almost simultaneously showing similar diel fluctuation while filter-feeding. The maximal ciliary stroke was observed at 20 degrees C in salt solution from 30 to 40 parts per thousand salinities. The stroke follows the Arrhenius equation in the temperature range from 5 to 30 degrees C with a break at around 20 degrees C when the experiment was performed with salt solution between 10 to 33 parts per thousand salinities."

The formation and intensity of UHIs can be influenced not only by the type of land cover, but also by other factors, such as the spatial patterns of thermal clusters (e.g., dimensions, contiguity, and integration). By emphasising the differences between semi-arid and cold-and-humid climates in terms of the thermal-spatial behaviours of various types of land cover in these climates, this paper aims to assess the behavioural patterns of thermal clusters in Tehran, Iran. To this end, the relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and the types of land cover is first demonstrated using combined multispectral satellite images taken by Operational Land Imager (OLI), Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) of the Landsat8 and MODIS, and Sentinel satellites to determine LST and land cover. The effects of different behavioural patterns of thermal clusters on the formation of daytime urban heat islands are then analysed through spatial cross-correlation analysis. Lastly, the thermal behaviours of each cluster are separately examined to reveal how their spatial patterns, such as contiguity, affect the intensity and formation of UHI, with the assumption that each point in a contiguous surface may exhibit different thermal behaviours, depending on its distance from the edge or centre. The results of this study show that the daytime UHIs do not occur in the central parts of Tehran, and instead they are created in the surrounding layer, which mostly consists of barren cover. This finding contrasts with previous research conducted regarding cities located in cold-and-humid climates. Our research also finds that the more compact the hot and cool clusters are, the more contiguous they become, which leads to an increase in UHIs. The results suggest that for every 100 pix/km(2) increase, the cluster temperature increases by approximately 0.7-1 degrees C. Additionally, placing cool clusters near or in combination with hot clusters interrupts the effect of the hot clusters, leading to a significant temperature reduction. The paper concludes with recommendations for potential sustainable and context-based solutions to UHI problems in semi-arid climates that relate to the determination of the optimal contiguity distance and land use integration patterns for thermal clusters."
"BLUMSTEIN, DT; ARNOLD, W",SITUATIONAL SPECIFICITY IN ALPINE-MARMOT ALARM COMMUNICATION,ETHOLOGY,100,1,13,,1995,"We studied the degree to which alpine marmot (Marmota marmota L.) alarm calls function as communication about specific external stimuli. Alpine marmots emit variable alarm calls when they encounter humans, dogs, and several species of aerial predators. The first part of the study involved observations and manipulations designed to document contextual variation in alarm calls. Alarm calls varied along several acoustic parameters, bur only along one that we examined, the number of notes per call, was significantly correlated with the type of external stimulus. Marmots were more likely to emit single-note alarm calls as their first or only call in response to an aerial stimulus, and multiple-note alarm calls when first calling to a terrestrial stimulus. This relationship was not without exceptions; there was considerable variation in the number of notes they emitted to both aerial and terrestrial stimuli, and a single stimulus type - humans - elicited a wide range of acoustic responses. The second part of the study involved playing back three types of alarm calls to marmots and observing their responses. Marmots did not have overtly different responses to the three types of played-back alarm calls. Our results are consistent with the hypotheses that: 1. Alarm calls do not refer to specific external stimuli; 2. Alarm calls function to communicate the degree of risk a caller experiences; and 3. Alarm calls require additional contextual cues to be properly interpreted by conspecifics."

The mechanisms underlying such variation are often behavioural, physiological or ecological in nature. We studied intraspecific variation in foraging strategies and its possible causes in a population of urban free-ranging dogs by accounting for variables of performance in novel food extraction tasks and responses to perceived threats. When presented with specially made food packets, dogs extracted food using two distinct techniques: 'gap widening' and 'rip opening'. The two techniques were distinguishable also in terms of their qualitative and quantitative attributes, that is, the sophistication of the process and latency in food extraction. Typically, males employed the sophisticated gap-widening technique, which was associated with faster food extraction and lower risk aversion; in contrast, females used the relatively underdeveloped rip-opening technique, which was relatively ineffective and mostly accompanied by active food guarding. Females during pregnancy/lactation behaved similarly to males. Upon exposure to an artificial threat, the performance of the dogs in foraging activities declined as a result of the more frequent usage of the less effective technique. Furthermore, foraging performance was positively related to both fearlessness and sensitivity to perceived threats. We explain these findings through both functional and mechanistic arguments.

This study investigated metabolic rates and preferred body temperatures of seven taxa of Australian pythons. We found that Australian pythons have particularly low metabolic rates when compared with other bold snakes, and that the metabolic rates of the pythons did not change either seasonally or on a daily cycle. Preferred body temperatures do vary seasonally in some species but not in others. Across all species and seasons, the preferred body temperature range was only 4.9 degrees C. The thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of oxygen consumption by pythons conformed to the established range of between 2 and 3. Allometric equations for the pooled python data at each of the experimental temperatures gave an equation exponent of 0.72-0.76, which is similar to previously reported values. By having low preferred body temperatures and low metabolic rates, pythons appear to be able to conserve energy while still maintaining a vigilant 'sit and wait' predatory existence. These physiological attributes would allow pythons to maximise the time they can spend 'sitting and waiting' in the pursuit of prey."

Habitat, especially vegetation structure, can influence all of these factors concurrently. Binary categorical assessments of habitat as open or closed, however, confound at least two functions of habitat structure that could influence the perceived risk of predation: concealment, which functions to hide an individual, and visibility, which enhances detection of a potential predator. Both can influence predation risk independently and simultaneously. In this study, we decoupled these functional properties of vegetation and studied the effects of concealment, visibility, and proximity to a refuge on the distance at which pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis) fled from an approaching threat (flight initiation distance; FID). Concealment by vegetation decreased perceptions of risk; however, pygmy rabbits exhibited elevated risk at high levels of visibility, regardless of the amount of concealment. Proximity to burrow entrances also influenced perceptions of risk, such that risk was significantly lower when rabbits were on or near burrow systems. Disentangling the functional properties of habitat can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence perceived risk and escape behaviors of prey and provide insight into how habitat structure mechanistically relates to predation risk."

The number of females per male varied from zero to three. Several male and territory traits were significantly correlated with number of females per male. We used multiple regression to obtain a single measure of male quality and a single measure of territory quality. These measures of male and territory quality correlated with each other and with male pairing success. We used path analysis to separate direct effects of male quality on pairing success from indirect effects due to high-quality males obtaining high-quality territories. Both direct and indirect pathways had significant effects on pairing success, and direct and indirect effects of male traits on pairing success were about equal. This study illustrates an analytical approach for estimating the relative importance of direct and indirect causal relationships in natural systems."

The simplest foraging strategy is to search randomly within a habitat; however, foragers can often assess habitat quality over various spatial scales and use this information to keep themselves in, or direct themselves to, regions of high resource abundance or low predation risk. We investigated models that describe a population of consumers competing for a renewable resource that is distributed among discrete patches. Our aim was to identify what foraging strategy or strategies are expected to persist within a population, where strategies differ in the degree of habitat assessment (i.e. none, local, or global). We were interested in how the optimal strategies are dependent on the cost of assessment and habitat structure (i.e. the variation in renewal rates and predation risks among patches). The models showed that the simple random foraging strategy (i.e. make no habitat assessments) often persisted even when the cost of habitat assessment was low. Persistence could occur when habitat assessment and population dynamics generated an ideal free distribution because it could be exploited by the random foragers. Habitat assessment was more advantageous when consumers could not achieve ideal free distributions, which was more likely as patches became less productive. When productivity was low we sometimes observed the situation where different foraging strategies generated resource heterogeneities that promoted their coexistence, and this could occur even when all patches were intrinsically identical.

It, along with time allocation, can be used by a forager to manage risk. Apprehension should increase, and time allocation should decrease with a forager's energetic state (marginal value of energy). We tested these predictions on Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) by manipulating the energetic state of the gerbils through augmentations of millet seeds. We also manipulated two risk factors, the microhabitat of the foraging patch (bush or open) and the presence of barn owls (Tyto alba). We measured apprehension of gerbils using the selectivity of gerbils for trays that differed in the distribution of seeds that they contained and time allocation using the amount of seeds left behind in trays, the giving-up density (GUD). Gerbils harvested 4.6 times more seeds when supplemental seeds were available, 17.4% fewer seeds when owls were present, 25.8% fewer seeds from the open than the bush microhabitat, and 19.3% fewer seeds from trays when seed augmentations were also present. With regard to time allocation, gerbils had higher GUDs (allocated less time) when risk was higher: in the open microhabitat and in the presence of owls. Also, the response of gerbils to owls was affected both by the seed augmentation and by microhabitat. With regard to apprehension, the gerbils were more apprehensive when extra seeds were added. Their level of apprehension changed little in the bush microhabitat but increased greatly in the open microhabitat when energetic state was manipulated. Thus, gerbils use both time allocation and apprehension in response to predators. Changes in the energetic state of a forager led to the predicted increase in apprehension accordance with Clark's asset protection principle."

Information-sharing (IS) and; producer-scrounger (PS) games predict different joining frequencies because they make distinct assumptions about food searching. IS games assume individuals can search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while PS games assume incompatible search modes; individuals search either as a producer, detecting only finding opportunities, or as a scrounger, detecting only joining opportunities; To determine the search assumption for flocks of ground-feeding granivores we studied the behaviour of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata, foraging in indoor aviaries for clumps of hidden millet seed. We looked for behaviour patterns preceding finding and joining events. An analysis of covariance showed that the frequencies of hopping with the head pointing up and down were statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the seed distribution, the birds' relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly When the seed distribution made any use of the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up declined to zero. Consequently, in ground-feeding birds such as spice finches, finding and joining behaviour conform more closely to the assumptions of a PS rather than an IS game.

We studied the responses of elk, Cervus elaphus, herd size and composition to natural variation in the risk of predation by wolves, Canis lupus, in the Gallatin Canyon of Montana. We found that elk herd size increased as distance to protective cover increased. A positive association between group size and distance to cover is often interpreted as evidence that grouping is an antipredator response. However, we found that herd size increased only on days that wolves were absent. When wolves were present, herd sizes remained small at all distances from cover. This suggests that aggregation far from cover on days that wolves were absent was a foraging response, rather than an antipredator response. These data highlight interaction between temporal and spatial variation in predation risk, and suggest caution in conclusions about the antipredator benefits of grouping in the absence of direct data on risk or predator presence.

Body reserves of Willow Tits as subordinate flock members were found to be dependent on the presence of dominant Crested Tits. At dusk, Willow Tits were heavier than Crested Tits. Body reserves of members of mixed-species flocks negatively correlated with dominance rank within both intraspecific and interspecific hierarchies. Removal experiments confirmed results of field observations, revealing a causal relationship between rank and ability to choose the safest fattening strategy. Body mass and fat reserves of Willow Tit alpha males decreased in the absence of Crested Tits. In contrast, body mass and fatness of dominant individuals of Crested Tits remained at the same level. To control for changes in body mass resulting from a higher rank and smaller flocks, the foraging height of remaining individuals of both species was recorded. Willow Tits responded to removal of Costed Tits by foraging closer to the top of the tree. No shifts were observed in groups with only Crested Tits. Fattening strategies dependent on social status represent a flocking cost to individuals belonging to a subordinate species. Further investigations should be done into the benefits of mixed-species flocking, which is a social behaviour common in parids."

The responses of free-living Belding's ground squirrels, Spermophilus beldingi, to playbacks of conspecific (three alarm calls and juvenile squeals) and heterospecific (wren song) vocalizations were observed from natal emergence until the age of dispersal. Discrimination of the five auditory stimuli was not present at emergence but developed within the next 5 days, with responsivity to whistle alarm calls, indicative of fast-moving predators, developing earlier than to trill alarm calls, associated with slow-moving predators. Response patterns (response duration, vigilant postures and initial responses) changed throughout the following 4 weeks, and approximated adult responses before juveniles dispersed. Juvenile responses were indirectly influenced by conspecifics, particularly the dam, as well as by the physical environment, including distance from the natal burrow and location within the meadow. Alarm-call responses appeared to be adapted to the juvenile's current stage of development, with younger juveniles making a trade-off between information gathering and escape responses. The development of appropriate responses to each alarm call is hypothesized to be facilitated by observations of experienced ground-squirrels' responses. Despite their vulnerability, juveniles may not emerge with fully formed associations between alarm calls and responses if the local predator context changes over time, thus favouring plasticity in the response repertoire.

Foraging on more cryptic seeds may increase predation risk by increasing the length of head down periods. Habitat structure may interact with this as birds are less able to detect predators with their head lowered in riskier obstructed habitats. We investigated patch choice in chaffinches Fringilla coelebs foraging in obstructed and open habitats and artificially manipulated the search times of seeds by colouring them either yellow or black. One trial consisted of a choice between the conspicuous seed in the open patch, and the cryptic seed in the obstructed patch; in the second trial the treatments were reversed. Individuals were more willing to forage in the obstructed habitat when the yellow seeds were present (43% of pecks made in the obstructed patch) than when the black seeds were present (18% of pecks in the obstructed patch). Differences in search time are likely to explain this result: yellow seeds were located almost twice as fast (1.26 +/- 0.60 seconds) as black ones (2.36 +/- 0.88 seconds). This experiment shows that individual foraging decisions may be influenced not only by food abundance but by the properties of individual food items (in this case seed crypsis) and the structure of the habitat they are present in."

We recorded maternal visual monitoring of infants (infant monitoring) ages 7-18 wk in a free-ranging, provisioned group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). The infant monitoring rate declined as a function of infants' ages in weeks and increased when the infants were beyond their mother's reach, indicating that infant monitoring reflects the vulnerability of infants. Females with infants increased infant monitoring when their infants were handled by other group members but not when their infants moved alone. This suggests that intragroup threats (harassment/mishandling or kidnapping) have a relatively stronger influence on infant monitoring than external threats (predation or infanticide) under the condition of this study. Infant monitoring of middle-/low-ranking females was more frequent than that of high-ranking females when their infants were handled by other individuals. This may reflect greater intragroup threats to infants of middle-/low-ranking females; however, further study is needed to confirm this. During important activities (feeding or grooming), the infant monitoring rate was lower than that during other activities (resting or self-directed behavior). However, even during important activities, females with infants increased infant monitoring when infants were handled. This indicates that females with infants face a trade-off between infant monitoring and other important activities, and even if females have to reduce the time spent on important activities, they increase infant monitoring when their infants face greater potential intragroup threats."

Also, the ongoing expansion of large carnivores in several European countries can lead to the recovery of (potentially energetically costly) anti-predator behaviours. In an area recently recolonized by Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx, we snow-tracked radio-collared roe deer Capreolus capreolus in order to investigate their bedding and feeding behaviour during winter, and assess how environmental factors affect their habitat use. We also tested the prediction that roe deer use more open sites than locally available in areas with a stalking predator such as the lynx. Our results showed that both bed sites and foraging sites had more cover, compared with random sites. Most of the variation in canopy cover and in the distance and foraging sites between bed sites and foraging sites was explained by prevailing weather. As the winter progressed, the presumed depletion of fat reserves promoted the use of more canopy cover at foraging sites by night, less by day and a decrease in the distance between beds, foraging sites and human activities. Males used artificial feeding sites less often and bedded further from humans than females. The data fit the hypothesis of tighter energy budgets for family groups (females with fawns) or that males are more cautious towards humans. There was no support for the hypothesis that roe deer used more open habitat than locally available in order to reduce their vulnerability to lynx predation. Owing to severe winter conditions and the danger of starvation, roe deer seem to be forced to accept a high risk when predators are present, not changing their main pattern of habitat use from comparative areas where predators are absent."

Understanding which factors can have an effect on social behaviour is thus important in order to develop the best management strategies in livestock industries. Here, we studied the social network structure of a flock of 84 Poll Dorset ewes and collecting dyadic associations data through the use of proximity sensors during two study periods. First, we analysed the social structure of ewes at a group-level, by analysing the community structure, and at individual-level, by determining whether the ewes showed social differentiation in their association patterns. Second, we measured for the contribution of genetic relatedness, age, weight, reproductive status and previous management sub grouping on social associations to test for homophily effects. Lastly, we evaluated whether social clustering was influenced by the stocking density of individuals in a field, and by weather parameters, through the use of two climatic indices, the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) and the Wind Chill Index (WCI). Our results showed that the pairwise associations between ewes are not-random and highly heterogeneous, both in total time spent in contact and in contacts duration. There was no evidence that ewes were subdivided into social communities, and at individual level, they showed markedly differentiated social relationships, demonstrating preferences in social ties. However, the factors that influenced the preferred social interactions between individuals changed over time. In the first study period ewes tended to maintain the social bonds formed in previous management sub grouping, most likely due to a social familiarization resulting from repeated interactions with the same individuals. In the second study period similarity in age influenced the strength of associations among ewes. We found no significant influence of reproductive status, weight (as an indicator of body size) and genetic relatedness on proximity associations in either study period. Moreover, our results showed the tendency of the ewes to form social clusters varied in relation to animals' density, and Wind Chill Index (WCI). The identification of conditions that modify the social behaviour of sheep is critically important in order to implement management and productivity strategies and our results highlight how flock social structure can change depending on environmental and social contexts."

Undulating ground resembles cover in offering opportunities for vertebrate predators to remain hidden from prey and vice versa. Some species prefer to forage in the open so as to avoid being surprised by predators while others remain close to cover and use it as a refuge when attacked.2. To determine if topography was important in influencing the sites chosen by sandgrouse for drinking, we measured a range of variables at water-holes used by black-bellied, pin-tailed and crowned sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis, P. alchata and P. coronatus) in Spain and Israel. All species drank at sites reasonably close to their feeding and nesting areas.3. In Spain, water-hole selection was quantified using stepwise logistic and linear regression analysis. The amount of dead ground surrounding each water-hole (i.e. ground not visible to drinking sandgrouse) was the most important factor influencing the birds' choice.4. These regression relationships were used to predict the pattern of use of water-holes at two localities in Israel. The agreement between observed and expected levels of exploitation was good, confirming the strong aversive influence of dead ground.5. Predatory birds were the biggest source of disturbance at drinking sites. By choosing sites with the least dead ground, sandgrouse probably reduced their risk of being surprised by predators while drinking."

Habitat structure influences visibility, which influences both the ability of prey to detect and respond to their predators. We studied how habitat visibility influenced time allocation and escape decisions of crimson rosellas ( Playcercus elegans). We examined the effect of visibility on time allocated to looking, locomotion and foraging. We measured escape decisions by experimentally approaching rosellas until they fled. We measured visibility by standing 12 m away from a 1-m(2) white sheet containing 36 points and counting the number of points that were visible. As measured, visibility influenced time allocated to both foraging and locomotion. However, there was no effect of visibility on flight-initiation distance or two other related measures of escape ( a measure of the latency to detect an approaching threat or the latency to flee once the threat was detected). Therefore, crimson rosellas modified their behaviour as a function of visibility, but this did not influence their decision to flee from an approaching human. We infer that they are sensitive to variation in visibility, but that this does not influence their overall perception of risk as we measured it. These two stages of antipredator behaviour may thus be largely independent; ubiquitous factors need not have ubiquitous effects on different aspects of antipredator behaviour."

In most social ungulates this leads to sexual segregation, probably because of incompatibilities between the activity budgets of males and females. Since most studies on behavioural differences between the sexes have been done on sexually dimorphic species, we decided to look at a system in which males and females are similar in body size. We studied time budgets, synchrony of behaviour, and bite rates of plains zebras (Equus burchelli) to evaluate the factors that enable these extremely social ungulates to stay in stable mixed-sex family groups throughout the year. As we predicted, time budgets were similar among males, lactating females, pregnant females, and non-reproductive females. Furthermore, we observed close synchronization of behaviours between females that differed in reproductive status and males. Lactating females, however, did take more bites per minute when foraging than either pregnant or nonreproducing females or males. We assume that the higher bite rates of lactating females were due to the extra costs of producing milk for their foal. We concluded that the special harem mating system, and for females the year-round possibility of conceiving, force the animals to synchronize their time budgets, which might be a major reason for the lack of difference in body size between males and females."

In this study, we obtained data about the reproductive ecology of the catfish G. genidens in the Guanabara Bay estuary, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, providing supporting information for management of its fishery. The sex ratio, mean size of each sex at first sexual maturation, and female fecundity were determined and the reproductive period was characterized. The males:females ratio was 1:2. The fecundity is low and increases proportionally to the females' growth in total length and weight. The breeding season occurs during the wannest months of the year, with spawning extending from October through March and incubation from December through April. Sexual maturation is late, with males maturing at a larger size than females. Skipping spawning was also identified in females. Based on the reproductive biology, it is suggested that the catch be restricted to individuals larger than 20 cm, considering the L-75 of the males, and that fishing be prohibited from December through March, to include the main period of spawning season by females and oropharyngeal incubation by males."

Complementarity in resource use involves spatial or temporal segregation of predators, which can result in better biological control when several species of natural enemies share a prey. In this study, we investigated the seasonal, spatial and diel segregation of Acyrthosiphon pisum predators and its predation in alfalfa fields, by setting out cards with sentinel aphids, and making observations every 3 h for a 24 h period. A temporal and spatial segregation of predators was observed. Coccinellids were the most abundant predators, representing 51% of the total observations, followed by syrphid larvae. Coccinellids were also responsible for high levels of predation throughout the year, although the species responsible varied from spring to summer and autumn. On the other hand, syrphids were only found in spring and summer, while spiders only in autumn. Predator species also differed on their preferred sites for predation, with Heteropterans and syrphids found on the foliage, the spider Neomaso articeps only on the ground, and coccinellid and Anyphaenidae species on both sites. The two main predator groups also showed distinct diel patterns, with coccinellids observed only during day and syrphids only during night. This predatory activity corresponded with aphid predation, observing more predation in spring, on the foliage and during the day time. The proportion of predators observed preying on cards in the different seasons did not corresponded tightly with their field abundance, particularly in the case of coccinellids, which maintained high levels of predation in spite of great variations in its field abundance. Our results support the hypothesis of a spatio-temporal segregation of the predators associated with A. pisum in alfalfa, which might be beneficial for the outcome of biological control of this pest.

Here, we experimentally elicited anti-predator behaviour in six different groups of forest-living Campbell's monkeys, using visual and acoustic models of leopards, crowned eagles, and snakes. Individuals produced a variety of anti-predator behaviours, depending on the type of predator and whether or not it was visible. Adult males generally behaved conspicuously, either by attacking eagles or producing threat behaviours at a distance to leopards. Adult females remained cryptic to eagles, but joined their male in approaching leopards. To snakes, both males and females responded strongly to familiar Gaboon vipers, but far less to unfamiliar black mambas. Finally, if a predator could only be heard, both males and females produced fewer alarm calls and often changed their vertical position in the canopy (upwards for leopards; downwards for eagles), despite all predator vocalisations being presented from the ground. We concluded that Campbell's monkeys display sex-specific anti-predator behaviours, which are largely driven by the predators' hunting techniques, mode of predator detection and the forest habitat structure."

Time budgets of both males and females were significantly affected: individuals provided with supplementary food spent less time foraging and more time preening and vigilant. In accordance with predictions on the difference between sexes in parental investment, males increased the time spent singing by 5 to 26% and reduced the number of feeds to nestlings from 5.4 to 2.0 h(-1). Females showed a higher rate of nestling feeding which offset reduced provisioning of nestlings by the males. The breeding success of control and supplemented pairs was similar. The mass of adults was monitored using electronic balances placed near the nest cavity. Control pairs decreased in mass while adults given supplementary food showed an increase. The difference between control and fed adults was greater in males than females. The hypothesis of an adaptive reduction in mass by all individuals due to programmed anorexia is not supported. We discuss the alternative hypothesis of a cost of reproduction utilizing estimates of energy expenditure from time budgets."

Local environmental factors which affect choice of scent-marking sites in a population of wild klipspringers in Zimbabwe are described. Scent marks were typically placed within a narrow vertical range at the end of upward-pointing twigs. Twigs were more likely to be selected if they were located above bare rock, particularly if the ground was raised above the immediately surrounding area or was close to a significant break in slope. A substantial proportion of sites were placed on dead wood. Marking sites may remain in use for a number of years, with turnover rates calculated at between 1 and 2% per annum. The species of tree on which marks were placed were recorded and compared with overall abundance in the habitat. Palatable tree species were found to be selected preferentially when compared to unpalatable ones. Several explanations for this are compared. It is concluded that, simply through preferential selection of certain local characteristics, klipspringers may enhance the visibility and predictability of their scent marks."

Several predators in turfgrass systems attack lepidopteran larvae; however, their predaceous activity is rarely recorded, as they leave hardly any evidence. Predaceous activity can be studied using clay models, an approach still rarely employed in turfgrass. Thus, assays were conducted to determine the types of impressions that common turfgrass arthropods leave on clay models simulating lepidopteran larvae. Nine impression types were characterized after exposing 16 arthropod taxa in enclosed arenas in the laboratory and one taxon in the field to two sizes of clay models, including scratches, paired marks, pricks, deep distortions, disturbed surfaces, detached segments, granulated surfaces, dents, and elongated scratches. Most arthropods produced scratches and paired marks, whereas granulated surfaces and elongated scratches were produced by only a few of the selected arthropods. To ensure that the impressions were correctly identified, non-expert volunteers reviewed the impressions, and they were accurately identified in >85% of the responses. Video recordings of arthropod interactions were captured to determine the behavior of the arthropods during their first interaction with the clay models. Most arthropods first interacted with the terminal rather than the middle regions of the models. There were no differences between their interactions with the large or small models, and they used their mouthparts as often as their legs. Knowledge of the impression types caused by common arthropods will improve the utilization of the clay model technique for field studies in turfgrass. This could contribute to improved management of natural enemies as part of an integrated pest management approach."

In these environments, complex species interactions could promote the evolution of acoustic signals and result in intriguing patterns of mimicry and convergence. In the Neotropical region, Neomorphus ground-cuckoos frequently associate with herds of collared peccaries and white-lipped peccaries. Bill clacking behavior in ground-cuckoos closely resembles the sound of teeth clacking in peccaries and these acoustic signals are used in agonistic and foraging contexts in both species. Here we demonstrate that the acoustic characteristics of bill clacking in ground-cuckoos are more similar to teeth clacking of peccaries than to bill clacking of the more closely related Geococcyx roadrunner. We propose that two hypotheses may explain the evolution of the clacking behavior in these taxa. First, because peccaries are known to successfully ward off attacks from large predators to defend their herds, mimicking their clacking can deceive predators, either by triggering clacking from nearby peccaries, or making it appear to the predators that peccaries are present when they are not. Second, ground-cuckoos and peccaries could mutually benefit from the use of similar signals to alert each other of the presence of predators. In this context, ground-cuckoos could serve as sentinels while peccaries could confer protection. We also discuss alternative explanations for this striking acoustic resemblance. Ground-cuckoos and peccaries provide an interesting opportunity to study how an ecological association could foster the evolution of acoustic mimicry."

The colony is located along a river terrace near the south entrance of Yellowstone National Park. The home-burrow is where the young are reared, where an animal normally spends the night, and where an animal goes when an alarm call is given. Auxiliary burrows are used temporarily as a place of refuge. The burrows are connected by a trail system that directs the movements of the animals. The distribution of adults and litters indicated a preference for burrows in the central part of the colony. Patterns of home range were of three types, those with no overlap, those with slight overlap and those with major overlap. Animals which utilized the same home range frequently avoided one another. The shape of the home range depended primarily on the nearness of the feeding area. Agonistic behavior modified both size and shape of home ranges. Changes in home range from year to year were correlated with changes in the individuals occupying home-burrows. The animals emerged from their burrows at about sunrise, had a morning peak of activity, a midday low and a second peak of activity in the late afternoon. All entered their burrows by 30 minutes after sunset. Communication between marmots involved the senses of sight, smell, touch, and, most importantly, hearing. The alarm call was given in response to any kind of intrusion into the life of the colony. No particular animal acted as a sentinel. Olfactory communication consisted of the greeting in which two animals sniffed each other's cheeks. One or two animals were dominant. Several tended to be submissive to all with which they had contact. Other relationships seem best characterized by a kind of neutrality in which each of the two animals avoids the other. Territorial behavior does not seem to occur in the yellow-bellied marmot. Hibernation began in the second week of August. Conflicts and alert calls were less numerous and activity in general greatly decreased. Increased wandering was shown by some adults. Agonistic behavior may be one of the factors that limits the number of marmots on a colony site. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author"

Frequent territorial interactions may force breeders to adjust nest-guarding behavior. We examined nest-guarding behaviors at active Bald Eagle nests in the lower Chesapeake Bay during the nesting season (2012 and 2013). Guarding coverage was 13.7 +/- 4.2% of total observation time during the pre-laying period, 6.8 +/- 2.2% of observation time in the incubation period, and 26.3 +/- 3.2% of observation time in the nestling period. Females were present in the nest area for 80.0 +/- 2.7% of the nestling period. Although males were present only 51.2 +/- 2.8% of the nestling period, male breeders guarded nests twice as often as females. Adults guarded most often from perches in adjacent trees and within 25 m of the nest. If increasing rates of conspecific interactions force males to allocate more time to nest guarding, a tradeoff may occur, with males dividing time between guarding the nest and foraging for food to provision offspring."

We evaluated effects of disturbance on the eastern migratory monarch butterfly (Denaus plexippus L.), which has declined markedly in recent decades, primarily attributed to the loss of milkweed host plants from annual crop fields in the US Midwest. Currently, remaining milkweeds in this region primarily occur in perennial grasslands, where disturbance is infrequent, predatory arthropods are abundant, and seasonal patterns of plant phenology differ from crop fields. In a two-year study in Michigan, USA, we applied three treatments to 23 patches of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.); one-third of each patch was left undisturbed, while the remaining thirds were mowed in either mid-June or mid-July, respectively, and allowed to regenerate. We subsequently measured effects on monarch oviposition, predator abundance, survival of sentinel eggs and larvae, and tested how milkweed phenology and aphid colonization-both of which are reset by disturbance-structure predation risk for immature monarchs. Monarchs laid more eggs on regenerating versus undisturbed stems under both mowing regimes. Predators were strongly suppressed by mowing treatments, requiring 2-4 weeks to recolonize milkweed after disturbance, and were more abundant on flowering or aphid-infested stems. We found no significant differences in monarch egg/larval survival, although it tended to be higher in mowed plots. Overall, monarchs laid more eggs on regenerating stems where their offspring may also experience enemy-free space. Future work should focus on testing grassland disturbance as a management tool to improve productivity of existing monarch breeding habitat."

Rhinolophus megaphyllus was monoestrous and monotocous. A delay of several months occurs between the delivery of spermatozoa to the caudae epididymides (late summer/early autumn) and copulation/ovulation/conception (winter), which occur towards the termination of the spermatogenic cycle. There is no storage of sperm in female tracts prior to ovulation but epididymal sperm storage persists beyond the time of birth (late spring). Male, but not female, readiness to initiate reproduction prior to the onset of winter, places this species in an 'intermediate' position with features of both temperate and tropical chiropteran reproductive cycle patterns. The presence of an extroverted corpus luteum in the female and of a complement of accessory sex organs in the male are normal glandular features for members of this chiropteran family. The role of the urethral gland is unknown; however, since there is no vaginal plug, its products apparently do not coagulate in the vagina in this species following insemination."

Availability of suitable habitat is important for flying migrants, and in particular for large birds that use the energetically expensive flapping flight mode, such as the Bewick's Swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii). Bewick's Swans largely feed on aquatic macrophytes during migration that may disappear when nutrient levels, waves, and turbidity exceed certain thresholds. Macrophyte collapse has been suggested as a reason for the sharp decline of the Bewick's Swan population during 1995-2015. We used Bewick's Swans fitted with GPS/GSM neck collars including an accelerometer and water sensor to record the occurrence of aquatic foraging in remote stopovers along their migratory route. We concentrated on spring migration, when stopovers are longer than during autumn, and focused on four key sites identified in earlier tracking studies. Within these sites, we identified areas that are protected based on the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). During three years (2017-2019), we obtained a total of 51 complete spring tracks of adult female Bewick's Swans. Most swans showed aquatic foraging along the coast of Estonia and in Dvina Bay, and about half in the Gulf of Finland and Cheskaya Bay. In Estonia and in the Gulf of Finland, swans predominantly used protected zones, but in Dvina Bay swans also foraged extensively in areas that are currently not protected according to WDPA. No protected areas occur in Cheskaya Bay. Macrophyte vegetation is threatened by ongoing or planned construction works in the Gulf of Finland and Dvina Bay, and by future oil and gas exploitation in Cheskaya Bay. Our study shows how migrants can be used as sentinels to pinpoint areas that require protection in order to maintain a chain of suitable stopovers on their migration."

However, knowledge of such interactions is limited in alpine ecosystems. In the study reported here, we assessed the extent of behavioural responses of the Alpine Chough Pyrrhocorax graculus, a bird species found in high-elevation habitats, to differing levels of human disturbance in two alpine areas, a ski resort popular with tourists year-round (disturbed site'), and a protected area with low tourist activity (undisturbed area'). As the accessibility and distribution of food is a potential factor affecting bird behaviour, we focused on the availability of food types to better discriminate between the effect of food and direct disturbance. We found that human presence was negatively associated with intake rates and amount of time spent in a foraging patch (stay time'). Moreover, vigilance and flushing distances were shorter in the disturbed site than in the undisturbed area. However, intake rates were highest and stay times were shortest in the site where anthropogenic food (mostly discarded food items) was available. The abundance of a key prey type, grasshopper, changed significantly over space and time and was lower in the more developed ski area, probably due to the presence of ski pistes. In conclusion, the study highlighted that human disturbance potentially affects foraging behaviour in Alpine Choughs and that the effects could be both positive and negative. Further investigations are needed to better disentangle the effects induced by direct and indirect disturbance and, more generally, to evaluate the potential benefits and negative effects of anthropization on mountain biodiversity. ZusammenfassungEinfluss von anthropogenen Storungen auf das Nahrungsverhalten einer alpinen VogelartHabitate in Bergregionen sind durch mehrere Faktoren gefahrdet, einschlie ss lich der anthropogenen Aktivitaten, wobei negative Einflusse durch positive Effekte derselben ausgeglichen werden konnen. Jedoch ist das Wissen bezuglich solcher Interaktionen in alpinen okosystemen noch sehr limitiert. Mithilfe von Untersuchungen an der Alpendohle Pyrrhocorax graculus, einer Hochland-Art, wurde das Verhalten in Bezug auf verschiedene Grade von anthropogener Storung untersucht. Dabei wurden zwei verschiedene alpine Gebiete miteinander verglichen, wobei das eine ein stark und das ganze Jahr hindurch genutztes Skigebiet und das andere ein Schutzgebiet mit geringer anthropogener Storung darstellt. Da der Zugang zu und die Verteilung von Futter einen moglichen Einfluss auf das Verhalten der Tiere haben, haben wir uns auf die Verfugbarkeit von verschiedenen Nahrungsressourcen konzentriert, um besser zwischen dem Einfluss der Nahrungsverfugbarkeit und der anthropogenen Storung auf das Verhalten unterscheiden zu konnen. Die Anwesenheit von Menschen war negativ mit den Aufnahmeraten von Nahrung und der Dauer des Aufenthalts an einem Nahrungsplatz assoziiert. Weiterhin waren die Distanz, bis Wachsamkeitsverhalten auftrat, und die Fluchtdistanz im gestorten Gebiet geringer als im weniger gestorten Gebiet. Dennoch waren die Aufnahmeraten am Hochsten und die Aufenthaltsdauer am Kurzesten, wo anthropogene Nahrungsressourcen (hauptsachlich weggeworfene Nahrungsmittel) vorhanden waren.Die Abundanz einer der Hauptnahrungsressourcen der Art, Heuschrecken, anderte sich signifikant mit Zeit und Ort und war in Skigebieten deutlich geringer, was vermutlich auf die Skipisten zuruckzufuhren ist. Schlie ss lich konnten wir zeigen, dass anthropogene Storungen das Nahrungsverhalten bei Alpendohlen beeinflussen, sowohl positiv wie auch negativ. Weiterfuhrende Untersuchungen sind notwendig, um besser zwischen den Einflussen von direkten und indirekten Storungen diskriminieren zu konnen und im Generellen die moglichen Vor- und Nachteile der Anthropisierung auf die Biodiversitat in Bergregionen einzuschatzen."

Females chew a small hole into the fruit, deposit a single egg within the cavity, and seal the hole with a clear anal secretion that hardens into an 'oviposition plug'. Female oviposition behavior was studied in a series of small-arena bioassays to determine whether previous oviposition in Jalapeno pepper fruit deterred subsequent oviposition and to determine what specific cues from an infested fruit influence female behavior. In choice and no-choice tests, females preferred clean fruit to fruit that had received four eggs 24 h previously (i.e., infested fruit), whether the fruit was infested with conspecific eggs or their own eggs. Further bioassays demonstrated that the presence of female frass, or oviposition plugs alone, in the absence of eggs or any fruit damage, was sufficient to deter oviposition. In addition, females given the choice between an infested fruit with the oviposition plug removed or an unaltered infested fruit preferred the fruit with no plugs, even when eggs, frass, and feeding damage were still present. To determine whether females would avoid infested peppers under more natural conditions, we quantified oviposition on infested and uninfested sentinel pepper fruit within individually caged plants and on clean and infested plants caged together. Females consistently laid more eggs on clean fruit than on infested fruits and moved within and among pepper plants to search for more acceptable oviposition sites. We conclude that oviposition plugs, along with contaminated female, but not male, frass contain a deterrent that, in the absence of any other cue, is enough to alert a female that a patch is occupied."

At the same time, the transmission cycles of most mosquito-borne pathogens (e.g. viruses or filarial parasites) are not completely understood. There is especially a lack of knowledge about the vector capacity of the different mosquito species, which is strongly influenced by their host-feeding patterns. While this kind of information is important to identify the relevant vector species, e.g. to direct efficient control measures, studies about the host-feeding patterns of mosquito species in Germany are scarce and outdated. Methods: Between 2012 and 2015, 775 blood-fed mosquito specimens were collected. Sampling was conducted with Heavy Duty Encephalitis Vector Survey traps, Biogents Sentinel traps, gravid traps, hand-held aspirators, sweep nets, and human-bait collection. The host species for each mosquito specimen was identified with polymerase chain reactions and subsequent Sanger sequencing of the cytochrome b gene. Results: A total of 32 host species were identified for 23 mosquito species, covering 21 mammalian species (including humans) and eleven bird species. Three mosquito species accounted for nearly three quarters of all collected blood-fed mosquitoes: Aedes vexans (363 specimens, 46.8 % of all mosquito specimens), Culex pipiens pipiens form pipiens (100, 12.9 %) and Ochlerotatus cantans (99, 12.8 %). Non-human mammals dominated the host species (572 specimens, 73.8 % of all mosquito specimens), followed by humans (152, 19.6 %) and birds (51, 6.6 %). The most common host species were roe deer (Capreolus capreolus; 258 mosquito specimens, 33.3 % of all mosquito specimens, 65 % of all mosquito species), humans (Homo sapiens; 152, 19.6 %, 90 %), cattle (Bos taurus; 101, 13.0 %, 60 %), and wild boar (Sus scrofa; 116, 15.0 %, 50 %). There were no statistically significant differences in the spatial-temporal host-feeding patterns of the three most common mosquito species. Conclusions: Although the collected blood-fed mosquito species had a strong overlap of host species, two different host-feeding groups were identified with mosquito species feeding on (i) non-human mammals and humans or (ii) birds, non-human mammals, and humans, which make them potential vectors of pathogens only between mammals or between mammals and birds, respectively. Due to the combination of their host-feeding patterns and wide distribution in Germany, Cx. pipiens pipiens form pipiens and Cx. torrentium are potentially most important vectors for pathogens transmitted from birds to humans and the species Ae. vexans for pathogens transmitted from non-human mammals to humans. Finally, the presented study indicated a much broader host range compared to the classifications found in the literature for some of the species, which highlights the need for studies on the host-feeding patterns of mosquitoes to further assess their vector capacity and the disease ecology in Europe."

The ranking of its four main prey types did not vary annually. Numerically, the prey comprised 50-75% limpets, 14-34% mussels, 8-18% chitons, 1-2% Northern Abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), and <1% other species. In 2009, we estimated prey availability and prey preference by Ivlev's electivity index. Northern Abalone, limpets, and chitons were highly preferred; mussels, turban snails, and barnacles were taken in proportion to their occurrence or avoided. Black Oystercatchers preferred abalone of 50 mm, smaller than the mean size available, in contrast to the selection of larger-than-average prey, typical for other prey species. In 2010, 52% of nesting territories sampled contained remains of Northern Abalone, despite that species' small contribution to the diet. The Northern Abalone has never been reported as prey of the Black Oystercatcher despite its high vulnerability to predation at low tides. We speculate that the recent inclusion of the Northern Abalone in the Black Oystercatcher diet on Haida Gwaii may indicate a greater abundance of Northern Abalone than in other regions of its distribution. The frequency of the oystercatcher's feeding on abalone was unexpected because under Canada's Species at Risk Act, the Northern Abalone was listed as endangered in 2010, after the population continued to decline after legal protection from harvest in 1990."

Benthic amphipods are considered the primary prey of gray whales in these waters, although no comprehensive quantitative analysis has been performed to support this assumption. Gray whale relative abundance, distribution, and behavior in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (69 degrees-72 degrees N, 155 degrees-169 degrees W) were documented during aerial surveys in June-October 2009-2012. Concurrently, vessel based benthic infaunal sampling was conducted in the area in July-August 2009-10, September 2011, and August 2012. Gray whales were seen in the study area each month that surveys were conducted, with the majority of whales feeding. Statistical analyses confirm that the highest densities of feeding gray whales were associated with high benthic amphipod abundance, primarily within 70 km of shore from Point Barrow to Icy Cape, in water < 50 m deep. Conversely, gray whales were not seen in 40-km x 40-km cells containing benthic sampling stations with 85 m(-2) or fewer amphipods. Continuing broad-scale aerial surveys in the Chlikchi Sea and prey sampling near feeding gray whales will be an important means to monitor and document ongoing and predicted ecosystem changes."

We radiomonitored greater and lesser rheas for 3 years in their respective habitats: the Pampas and the Patagonia regions. We chose two study areas in each habitat with similar agricultural activities and different hunting control. We did not find significant differences in movements and home range size between study areas of each species. This suggests that disturbance caused by human presence in the areas did not affect rhea spacing behaviors. Moreover, lesser rheas showed larger home range and movements than greater rheas, showing that the home range size is not an immutable property of body mass, and that abundance and distribution of food appears to be the main factor that influences the movements and home range size of these birds."

Field experiments using a human simulated predator show that a lizard, the broad-headed skink, Eumeces laticeps, alters several aspects of feeding behavior in ways suggesting tradeoffs between predation risk and feeding. When food (cricket) was closer to the predator, the lizards more frequently did not attack it. and often retreated to safety before consuming it, reducing the duration of exposure to predation. The probability of attacking a cricket decreased with distance of the lizard from refuge, reflecting greater risk due to increased time required to reach refuge. Latency to attach increased with distance of the lizard from refuge, suggesting that lizards assessed the risk as acceptable after observing the predator's continued immobility. Large crickets were attacked with higher probability and shorter latency than small crickets, indicating that greater risk was acceptable fur greater energetic benefit. The lizards more frequently carried large than small crickets to refuges before eating them, reducing duration of exposure because handling time was greater for larger crickets. Smaller crickets were consumed where captured, again indicating modification of feeding behavior in response to predation risk. The skinks also reduced risk by reducing handling time when closer to the predator. Escape was delayed until a predator approached closer when lizards were eating than when not eating. This delay may reflect a tradeoff between predation risk and acquisition of food."

Similar problems are found in process control, commercial aviation and medical settings. To examine the effect of boredom in such settings, a long-duration low-task-load experiment was conducted. Three low-task-load levels requiring operator input every 10,20 or 30 mm were tested in a 4-h study, using a multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment that leverages decentralized algorithms for sometimes-imperfect vehicle scheduling. Reaction times to system-generated events generally decreased across the 4 h, as did participants' ability to maintain directed attention. Overall, the participants spent almost half of the time in a distracted state. The top performer spent the majority of time in directed and divided attention states. Unexpectedly, the second-best participant, only 1% worse than the top performer, was distracted for almost one-third of the experiment, but exhibited a periodic switching strategy, allowing himself to pay just enough attention to assist the automation when needed. Indeed, four of the five top performers were distracted for more than one-third of the time. These findings suggest that distraction due to boring, low-task-load environments can be effectively managed through efficient attention switching. Future work is needed to determine optimal frequency and duration of attention state switches, given various exogenous attributes, as well as individual variability. These findings have implications for the design of and personnel selection for supervisory control systems where operators monitor highly automated systems for long durations with only occasional or rare input."

Although several adaptive explanations have been proposed to account for age-dependent antipredator behavior, similar explanations are rarely extended to sex-specific responses. Furthermore, no attempts have been made to quantitatively estimate the direction or magnitude of these differences across studies. Here, we use meta-analysis to discover overall trends in the literature, as well as differences owing to experimental or population parameters. Across our sample of available studies (unfortunately biased toward rodents and primates), males respond more than females, and young respond more than adults. Furthermore, young of quickly maturing species display more adult-like antipredator behavior than young of slowly maturing species, suggesting that young must develop antipredator behavior at a pace consistent with the length of their ontogenetic period (a.k.a. juvenile/sub-adult period, defined as the time between birth and attainment of sexual maturity). We review previously proposed explanations for such age differences, namely, that longer ontogenetic periods may provide juveniles with time to develop behavior through learning and experience, or, maturation rates may influence age-specific selection pressures and the consequent evolution of age-specific behavioral strategies. We evaluate our results in light of these hypotheses, although our conclusions are limited by the number and taxonomic bias of available studies. We therefore suggest ways in which future studies may tease apart the relative importance of learning and experience vs. age-specific adaptive behavior, and draw attention to opportunities for research on age-and sex-specific alarm call responses."

When the rate of prey loading at the patch declines with time spent in the patch, the optimal, rate-maximizing load sizes increase with round-trip travel times between patch and central place. Numerous tests of this rate-maximizing currency have been carried out with eastern chipmunks carrying loads of seeds to their burrow. All tests have provided consistent qualitative support for the model (load sizes increase with distance) as well as consistent quantitative rejection of the model (loads carried are always considerably smaller than optimal). Confidence in the repeated rejections of the currency is weak because the predicted optimal load sizes stem from extrapolations of the loading function beyond the data used to estimate it. In this study, we provided subjects in the field with a food patch that provided the same increasing interval schedule of prey arrival at 2 m and 15 m from their burrow. Results confirm the quantitative failure of the rate-maximizing currency for the central place foraging model. We propose that the consistent failures of rate maximization with chipmunks are probably due to the higher predation danger when collecting seed from a patch compared to travelling.

In Australia, feral horses, Equus ferus caballus, have naturalized in many ecosystems, and foals are at risk from both predation by dingoes and sexually selected infanticide by nonpaternal stallions. This study tested maternal responses to these two forms of risk: risk of predation through dingo call playbacks and infanticide risk through a comparison of maternal protectiveness of foals in single- and multistallion bands. Mares were more vigilant and spent more time close to foals in bands with multiple resident stallions, where there is a higher risk of infanticide, relative to bands with a single stallion. Dominant stallions spent more time close to foals following the dingo call playbacks, indicating that stallions may play an important role in detecting and protecting foals from interspecific sources of risk. There was no significant increase in maternal protectiveness in response to dingo call playbacks, indicating that mares did not perceive dingo calls to be an immediate threat to foals. While predators were present, infanticide risk appeared to be the most significant modifier of maternal behaviour in this study. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Here, we used filmed giving-up density experiments to investigate behavioral coping responses of foraging small prey animals at three sites (close, mid, and far) along an urban disturbance gradient. Our study design included natural and experimentally added stressor cues of predators and/or human disturbance. We observed small mammal foraging behaviors, particularly: the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), black rat (Rattus rattus), and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), and to a lesser degree several species of native birds. We found that at the close urban-edge environment, coping responses to human disturbances were most pronounced, and predator cues from the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) were perceived as least risky. However, at the mid environment, red fox cues were perceived as most risky, especially when combined with human disturbance. At the far environment, domestic cat (Felis catus) cues were perceived as most risky, again when combined with human disturbance. Impacts from the combined stressors of predator and human disturbance cues appeared to be additive, with higher risk being perceived with increasing distance from urban build-up. Behavioral adjustments were observed to be the primary response to stressors by small prey animals in the close environment. In the mid environment, slight temporal shifts in activity across the night were more evident. In the far environment, habitat components were likely being used differently as the primary coping response to stressors. As mostly the same species were observed along the disturbance gradient, our results suggest a level of response plasticity that is calibrated to the level of exposure to a stressor and the stressor type. To maximize conservation outcomes in urban habitats, we therefore propose that management should be sensitive to the level and history of human disturbance, as this affects the coping responses of wildlife that remain."

Since re-growth of trees can be slow and management cycles can span over 100 years, long-term longitudinal data are needed to assess the effects of forestry on organisms living in these habitats. Here, we draw upon 50 years of population data of an open-nesting, sedentary bird species, typically of boreal forests, the Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus). Forests at the study site were managed by clear-cutting and re-plantation, and a management cycle spanning over 120 years. We tracked changes in forest structure in the nest vicinity and the whole territory with the help of aerial images, and linked them to territory occupancy and offspring production in 13 territories. While territories were occupied in 77.2% of all instances, reproduction was only successful in 19.6% of all instances. Both parameters were positively influenced by a large proportion of unthinned forests older than 50 years, which provide visual protection from nest and adult predators. Thus, it is crucial to assess both territory occupancy and reproductive output to understand the effects of forestry on bird populations. Moreover, our results suggest that in forests with slow turnover cycles, management which avoids thinning (such as green tree retention forestry) can promote population persistence of open-nesting bird species.

"Mauck, RA; Harkless, KC","The effect of group membership on hiding behaviour in the northern rock barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,62,743,748,10.1006/anbe.2001.1798,2001,"Animals living in groups are thought to gain fitness through decreased predation risk, while often paying a cost in terms of increased competition in foraging. Thus, the balance struck between predator avoidance and foraging should be affected by group membership. For animals that avoid predation by withdrawing into a refuge (i.e. 'hiding'), such as the northern rock barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, that balance should be particularly important since predator avoidance excludes foraging altogether. We tested the hypothesis that barnacles living in groups should spend less time hiding when faced with a perceived threat than should solitary barnacles. We presented group-living and solitary barnacles with a simulated threat and measured hiding time with the prediction that barnacles in groups would return to foraging more quickly than solitary barnacles. Hiding time for group-living barnacles was significantly less than for solitary barnacles. We then manipulated barnacle group size with the prediction that an individual barnacle's behaviour would change based on group membership alone. We tested individual barnacles three times in an A-B-A design in which barnacles were tested in one of two sequences, solitary-group-solitary, or group-solitary-group. We found that group membership had a significant effect on barnacle foraging behaviour in that individuals emerged from hiding sooner when tested in a group than when tested alone. We conclude that, as predicted by optimality theory, group membership strongly affects foraging decisions by this refuge-using animal. We argue that the proximate mechanism for such behaviour may involve a simple binary reaction to living in a group. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

We created food patches to reveal monkeys' foraging cost of predation. We measured the monkeys' variation in predation costs with patches stratified by height and arrayed horizontally. We expected the monkeys to harvest the most from patches with the least substrate/most food, and to harvest the least from patches with the most substrate/least food. Furthermore, we predicted that giving-up densities (GUDs) would (1) decrease with greater height (2) increase on the ground when sightlines were blocked, and (3) in a landscape grid, decrease in patches near trees and increase in patches near shrubs. Monkeys harvested the most from the richest patches and the least from the poorest patches. Along a vertical axis, GUDs decreased by 15% from 0.1 m to 2 m, and by 10% from 2 m to 5 m. Along a horizontal axis, GUDs were affected by curtain-blocked sightlines (4.7% higher with curtains), but not by distances to vegetation. We demonstrated that the vertical landscape gradient is more meaningful to Sykes' monkeys than the terrestrial horizontal. We conclude that experiments with giving-up densities in depletable food patches provide effective means for studying primate ecology. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Theoretically, alarm call structure could covary with predator type and could communicate potentially referential information, or calls could covary with the degree of risk a caller experienced when it emitted a call. Using similar methods, I studied the ways in which Olympic (Marmota olympus), hoary (M. caligata), and Vancouver Island marmots (M. vancouverensis) communicated situational variation. I observed both natural alarm calling, and I artificially elicited alarm calls with simulated terrestrial and aerial predators. I used playback experiments to study marmots' responses to different alarm call variants. All three species produced four roughly similar but distinctive loud alarm vocalizations that could be categorized by their relative shape, duration, and whether calls were quickly repeated to create multi-note vocalizations. in addition, the Vancouver Island marmot produced a fifth loud alarm call-the kee-aw. Call micro-structure varied as a function of the distance the caller was from an alarming stimulus and the type of alarming stimulus. Two lines of evidence suggest that all three species had alarm calls associated with the caller's risk (i.e, they were not referential). First, marmots often changed call types within a falling bout: there were no unique stimulus-class specific vocalizations. Second, marmot responses to alarm calls were graded: marmots did not have unique responses to different call types. These three close taxonomic relatives with superficially similar calls, communicated risk differently."
"JACOBSEN, OW; UGELVIK, M",ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR OF BREEDING EURASIAN WIGEON,JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY,63,324,330,,1992,"Anti-predator behavior was observed during a study (1983-1985) of the feeding ecology and social behavior of breeding Eurasian Wigeon (Anas penelope L.) in western Norway. When Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) appeared, wigeon and other dabbling ducks congregated in a group, became alert, quacked loudly and followed the predator's movement. In contrast, as avian predators appeared, wigeon became alert, retreated into emergent vegetation, or laid down on the shore with their heads stretched out, and remained motionless until the predator passed. Wigeon responded to nest predators, e.g., Common Raven (Corvus corax) and Hooded Crow (C. corone cornix) by assuming alert postures in 84% and 60% of the occasions in terrestrial and aquatic habitats, respectively. The observed difference between habitats was probably due to the birds' reduced ability to detect predators and escape attacks in terrestrial environments. Foraging wigeon responded to the presence of avian nest predators more by assuming alert postures during the egg-laying and incubation periods than during the prelaying period. Wigeon became alert in 78% (terrestrial habitats) and 66% (aquatic habitats) of the occasions when warning calls were given by four other species. They responded more to warning calls during the egg-laying and incubation periods than during the prelaying period. It is concluded that wigeon have evolved different strategies to escape attack from avian and ground predators. Wigeon may also benefit from warning calls given by other species, because warning calls may allow enhanced predator detection and increased foraging efficiency."

Response time variability was significantly increased during later task segments (p < 0.05). These segments were also associated with increased variability in the amplitude of saccades (p < 0.05). Saccade durations during the late task segments were also longer and more variable (p < 0.05). Correlations between response times and measure of saccadic activity were also computed across consecutive 5 min intervals for each individual subject. The obtained correlations between saccade latency and response times exceeded 0.70 for six of the twelve subjects. Additional analyses examined the relationship between trials characterized by extreme values on either the performance or the gaze control measures. Trials characterized by extremely long response times were also associated with increased saccade amplitudes, durations and latencies (p < 0.01). Conversely, response times were abnormally long on trials categorized as extreme on the basis of the saccade morphology and timing measures (p < 0.01). These results confirm the utility of the sustained attention task as a laboratory platform for the development of real-time systems for alertness monitoring. The data also support the contention that measures of gaze control behavior can reflect aspects of cognitive activity and, therefore, should be seriously considered for inclusion in any physiologically-based alertness assessment battery."
"Peuhkuri, N","Shoal composition, body size and foraging in sticklebacks",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,43,333,337,10.1007/s002650050499,1998,"Individuals which deviate from the majority in groups are likely to be most vulnerable to predation. This oddity effect, by definition, is frequency dependent, eventually fading at equal frequencies of the phenotypes in a group. It has been hypothesized that the increased predation risk of odd individuals may play an important role in the formation of phenotypically uniform shoals of fish. However, recent work has indicated that individuals may experience, or value, their predation hazard differently depending on their own size in relation to that of other group members: single large fish, but not small ones, appear concerned about their oddity in a shoal. Here I show that the apparent wariness of large fish is also expressed in a frequency-dependent manner, closely conforming to what is predicted if the oddity effect is responsible for their behavior. Using foraging activity of individuals as a means to evaluate their predation risk, I demonstrate with shoals comprising 12 threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) that large fish forage least actively when in a shoal consisting of 2 large and 10 small fish. An increase in the number of large fish to 4 among 8 small individuals clearly results in an increase in their foraging activity. However, having reached an equal frequency with small fish in a shoal, large fish do not seem to change their foraging activity much even when their number in a shoal increases further. In contrast, foraging activity of small sticklebacks remains fairly constant throughout the entire range of tested shoal compositions, providing further evidence that small and large fish respond to their oddity differently."

Mustached tamarin groups were spread over larger areas than those of saddleback tamarins. Group size and behavior affected group spread and interspecific proximity: larger groups of both species were dispersed over greater areas, and the larger troop had the lowest degree of interspecific proximity. Behavior also affected group spread and interspecific proximity: when traveling individuals were spread over a larger area, and the distance between heterospecifics was greater than when stationary. We examined spatial proximity using data on the distance from nearest neighbor. Overall, distance to nearest neighbor was not affected by group size. Based on specific behaviors, foraging saddleback tamarins were significantly nearer conspecifics than to mustached tamarins. Tamarins have polymorphic color vision, and trichromats-having 3 types of visual pigment-versus dichromatic individuals' with two types of pigment-may be better at perceiving yellow or russet colored predators and conspecifics than their dichromatic counterparts are. Color vision status affected spatial positioning, with vigilant trichromats being further from their neighbors than their dichromatic conspecifics were. We discuss the findings with respect to the ecology of the species. Specifically, interspecific differences in group spread and spatial proximity are related to differences in the supports used, and the effect of troop size on interspecific proximity is related to increased resource competition. The finding that trichromats are further from their neighbors represents the first example of a behavioral correlate of color vision ability in a wild species with polymorphic color vision, and is explained through the perception of predation risk."
"Chapple, David G.","Ecology, life-history, and behavior in the Australian Scincid genus Egernia, with comments on the evolution of complex sociality in lizards.",Herpetological Monographs,,145,180,,2003,"Squamate reptiles generally have been ignored in the search for a unified theory for the evolution of sociality due to the perception that they exhibit little social behavior beyond territoriality and dominance hierarchies and display polygynous mating systems. However a growing body of research has revealed unsuspected levels of social complexity and diversity in mating systems within the squamate lineage, particularly among the members of the Australian Scincid genus Egernia. Several species of Egernia are amongst the most highly social of all squamate reptiles, exhibiting stable social aggregations and high levels of long-term social and genetic monogamy. Social complexity is widespread within the Egernia genus, with reports of social aggregations in 23 of the 30 described species. The purpose of this review was to examine the potential for the Egernia genus as a model system for study of the evolution of sociality and monogamy within squamate reptiles. Current evidence indicates there is substantial variability in social complexity both within and between species, with social organization covering the spectrum from solitary to highly social. Four highly social Egernia species are known to live in stable social aggregations consisting of closely related individuals (adults, subadults, juveniles; i.e., 'family' groups) that appear to utilize chemical cues to recognize group members (kin recognition). Enhanced vigilance against predators is one presumed benefit of group membership. Additionally, juveniles within social groupings appear to receive low levels of indirect parental care. Several Egernia species create seat piles that mark group territories. Three Egernia species exhibit long-term social and genetic monogamy and several inbreeding avoidance strategies have been documented. However, it is currently unknown whether monogamy is widespread within Egernia. Egernia species occupy a broad range of habitats, although most are terrestrial, saxicolous or semi-arboreal. Several species display an attachment to a permanent home site, generally a rock crevice, burrow or tree hollow. Egernia species take 2-5 years to mature, live for 5-25 years, and are viviparous with litter size positively correlated with body size. Several Egernia species are herbivorous, with the degree of herbivory increasing with body size and during ontogeny in larger species. Most smaller species are either insectivorous or omnivorous. Species of Egernia have a wide range of reptilian, avian, and mammalian predators. Several larger species possess several behavioral and morphological features to prevent their extraction from rock crevices, including highly modified keeled scales and numerous defensive behaviors. Color pattern polymorphism is present in five Egernia species. Potential ecological correlates of sociality and monogamy are discussed. The life-history hypothesis predicts long-lived, late-maturing species should evolve complex sociality. The habitat availability hypothesis relies on the assumption that refugia may be limited in some ecological settings, and group formation is a consequence of co-habitation of available refugia. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and testable predictions are formulated and discussed. Specific future research directions are outlined to take advantage of Egernia as a model system for comparative research on a lineage that represents an independent origin of social organization comparable to that found in birds and mammals."

With females weighing about half-as much as males, ibex are one of the most sexually dimorphic ungulate species. Time budgets and bite rates of different age, sex, and reproductive condition classes as well as of animals in different reproductive condition were compared to evaluate how sexual differences in body size and differences in energetic needs of lactating and non-lactating. females affects these measures. Adult males spent more time lying, standing and walking and less time grazing than adult females. Non-lactating females spent more time lying and walking and less time grazing than lactating females. Lactating females took the most bites per minute and adult males the fewest, while non-lactating females showed intermediate bite rates. Lactating. females fed less on bushes and more on graminoids than non-lactating females or. males. While the mean lengths of activity bouts did not differ between lactating-and non-lactating females, males grazed on average for a shorter period of time, stood and walked for longer than adult females: We concluded that differences in body size and in reproductive expenditures lead to differences in behaviour, probably leading to sexual segregation."
"Abramsky, Z; Rosenzweig, ML; Subach, A",The costs of apprehensive foraging,ECOLOGY,83,1330,1340,10.2307/3071947,2002,"We used a behavioral bioassay, in the form of foraging behavior of Gerbillus allenbyi, and the ideal free distribution to estimate the costs associated with risk of predation. Experiments were conducted in two pairs of 2-ha field enclosures. Risk of predation was introduced to one I-ha subplot of each pair of enclosures either by simulating the light of a full moon or by causing trained owls to fly over our experimental subplot. We used a titration method to estimate the energetic costs associated with risk of predation. We added seeds to the 1-ha subplot of each enclosure that experienced the risk of predation. The adjacent subplot served as a control. Without seed addition the subplot without risk of predation had more foraging activity: the foragers were avoiding the risk of predation. As the amount of seeds in the treatment increased, the gerbils responded smoothly and quantitatively and shifted their foraging activity back to the subplot with the seeds (and risk). At addition rates of 4.24-8.47 seeds per individual per ha per night (simulated-moonlight treatment) and 4.24-5.64 g seeds per individual per ha per night (owl-flights treatment) the seed addition compensated for the extra risk. At these rates the foraging activity on the two subplots of each enclosure was the same. Our results suggested that, when challenged by the threat of predation, G. allenbyi individuals spent at least 25% of their foraging time being vigilant."

However, the extent to which they use finder's share (i.e. amount of food eaten in a patch before other individuals arrive) as a cue when making these decisions is unknown. It is likely that the removal of finder's share decreases patch attractiveness to scroungers. However, it is unclear how large a finder's share must be to reduce attractiveness, or how this varies with food availability. To answer these questions, we recorded the patch-joining decisions of dominant goats, Capra hircus, when presented with a choice between an artificial patch where finder's share had been removed by a subordinate patch holder (producer), and one where the patch holder had just started eating. We used time spent feeding by a patch holder (10, 30, 60 and 120 s) as an index of finder's share size, and tested this using three food availabilities (40 g, 100 g and 300 g). At low (40 g) and intermediate (100 g) food availabilities, scrounging goats avoided the finder's share patch once the patch holder had fed for >= 30 s (i.e. 25% and 17% of the food removed, respectively). However, at the highest food availability (300 g), these goats continued to join the finder's share patch even after the patch holder had fed for 120 s (18% removed). Ultimately, our results indicate that goats weigh up both food availability and the finder's share when making scrounging decisions. Nevertheless, finder's share removal was less important in patches with more food. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

On the basis of observational data of predation by the desert monitor lizard (Varanus griseus caspius) on the great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus), a social rodent of desert Central Asia, we predicted that in a year after a peak in prey density, when the abundance of terrestrial predators is still high, the group mode of life of a prey species might become disadvantageous. Social groups could advertise themselves and attract predators. We therefore hypothesized that the probability of predation would be higher for gerbils in outlying social groups than in groups closely associated with each other, in larger compared with smaller groups, and in groups with an active adult male compared with solitary females with no resident male. We also analyzed whether the survival of gerbils and the stress levels in adult and juvenile males were related to frequency of visits by monitor lizards at gerbil colonies (isolated systems of burrows used by gerbil groups of any size), distance between colonies, and size of social groups. We found that frequency of visits by the monitor lizard depended on distance to the nearest neighboring colony. The more distant the gerbil colony, the more visits by the lizard and the lower the survival of juveniles. We also found a positive correlation between concentration of fecal corticosterone in young males and frequency of monitor lizard visits at colonies. This pattern was not as pronounced in adult males. Results did not support the hypothesis that larger groups would have higher predation because frequency of predator visits, distances to the nearest occupied colonies, and survival of juveniles did not correlate significantly with the size of family groups. There was no difference in survival of juveniles in colonies occupied by single females compared with colonies in which an adult male was present. These results suggest that there is a possible trade-off between competing strategies of antipredator behavior and that factors other than predation are influencing gerbil survival."
"Hall, CL; Fedigan, LM",Spatial benefits afforded by high rank in white-faced capuchins,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,53,1069,1082,10.1006/anbe.1996.0392,1997,"Group living is a source of both costs and benefits for animals. Benefits may include decreased predation risk, and an increased ability to find food and defend clumped resources; the most prominent cost is probably increased competition for food within the group. Presumably, animals will always try to minimize the cost they receive relative to the corresponding benefit. Since costs and benefits will vary between spatial positions within the group, animals should prefer those spatial positions with the lowest costs relative to benefits. For groups whose members are organized by a social dominance hierarchy, access to preferred spatial positions may be a benefit of high rank. We examined the relationship between dominance rank and spatial patterns in two groups of white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus. We expected the animals to be faced with two cost-benefit gradients: predation risk increasing from centre to edge, and depletion costs increasing from front to back. Depletion was a significant factor in the dry season but not in the wet season; therefore, presumably only the predation risk gradient was present in the wet season. Dominant animals were more central than their subordinate counterparts during both seasons, and within the centre, they preferred the most forward position during the dry season but not during the wet season. The absence of variation in agonism across spatial positions suggests that active exclusion of subordinates by dominant animals cannot explain the spatial patterns observed. Instead, we conclude that subordinates avoid dominant animals as a strategy to reduce contest competition. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Changes in behaviour can adversely affect wildlife, compromise assumptions of survey methods, and reduce the effectiveness of management operations. In this study, we investigated the behavioural responses of free-ranging feral goats to helicopters and the main determinants of alert behaviour in response to helicopters. Ground-based reporters made 784 observations of feral goat groups during 34 standardised helicopter surveys used to estimate abundance. Feral goats were often alert (44% of observations) and, in 31% of observations, moved (up to 1.5 km) in response to helicopter over-flights but no feral goats were observed to be injured nor did any post-partum females desert their young in response to over-flights. Regression analyses indicated that the distance from the helicopter and prior activity were the most important factors influencing the extent of alert behaviour and the distance moved in response to helicopter disturbance. The responses of herds of goats in different home ranges were variable, and cumulative survey time, type of helicopter and the density of herds also influenced behavioural responses. Results indicated that, while long-term effects of helicopter disturbance on feral goat behavioural ecology are minimal, short-term changes in behaviour frequently occur and should be considered when using helicopters to manage feral goats.

Adaptive hypotheses suggest that such flocking should be more likely in species that are vulnerable to predation due to their smaller size, their preference for more open habitats or their more active foraging mode. In addition, flocking is also thought to be promoted by prey clumpiness because clumps are more easily located by foragers in groups. I examined the relationship between ecological traits and the evolution of flocking at the family taxonomic level among all bird families using a phylogenetic approach. Flocking evolved more often in clades with a preference for clumped prey but also occurred with dispersed prey in groups with kin bonds. The role of predation effects was less clear. The likelihood of flocking actually increased with body mass and failed to correlate with habitat openness in the phylogenetically corrected analysis. Although flocking prevailed in clades with an active foraging mode, all clades with a non-active foraging mode showed a preference for dispersed prey, which on its own could account for the effect of foraging mode. The same effect could explain the relative lack of flocking among clades with nocturnal habits. Flocking occurred to the same extent across habitat types and climate zones. At the family level, the results so far indicate a major role for prey characteristics in the evolution of intraspecific flock-feeding in birds.

Previously, we showed that durations of learning flights are modulated in response to spatial uncertainty and profitability of a food source. Here, we examined whether longer learning flights allow bees to return to a goal with greater spatial accuracy. We found that longer learning flights performed at a new location increased the probability and accuracy of a bee's return to the departure point. After performing reorientation flights in response to uncertainty at a familiar location, bees continued to rely on previously learned information, but longer reorientation flights increased the likelihood that bees would use updated information acquired via reorientation flights. Longer reorientation flights performed in response to changes in the distribution and profitability of food within a familiar area decreased the likelihood that a bee would return to the departure point. These results suggest that longer learning flights have a greater influence on search than do shorter flights, but bees use the information obtained during the learning flights differently depending on the circumstances prompting the learning flights in the first place. Our studies reveal a richer picture of the function of learning flights than previously appreciated, and provide evidence of their role in the adaptive modi. cation of information gathering in response to ecological changes.

Tools and techniques used to monitor prairie dogs have important implications for the management and conservation of grassland ecosystems. Behavioral responses by prairie dogs to predators may offer an opportunity to improve techniques that rely on visually based survey techniques by increasing the visibility of individuals. We evaluated whether the use of a visual stimulus resembling a common predator could increase the number of white-tailed prairie dogs (C. leucurus) observed during visual count surveys conducted in June and July of 2017 in Wyoming, USA. We designed a visual stimulus consisting of a remote-controlled toy car fitted with a badger (Taxidea taxus) pelt. We found counts of prairie dogs increased from 14.2 (95% CI = 10.4-18.0) to 32.6 (95% CI = 24.1-41.1) individuals/4-ha plot when this visual stimulus was deployed. Our top model predicted counts to be 2.3 times greater when a visual stimulus was used. The increase in counts elicited by use of a visual stimulus may therefore improve the accuracy and efficiency of traditional visual counts and other visually based monitoring techniques for prairie dogs. By enabling managers to take advantage of behavioral responses, use of a visual stimulus as described here could aid efforts to monitor and manage prairie dog populations and consequently conserve prairie ecosystems.

Males, in all categories, spent most of their time foraging (65 % of overall time budget). There was a significant difference in time spent in aggressive and in miscellaneous (defecation. alertness to observer, scratching) activities based on habitat type: most aggressive encounters and miscellaneous activity occurred on hilltops of areas dominated by mata barrosa shrubs (Mulinum spinosum). It is likely that territorial finale guanaco behaviors are related to the resources defended rather than to any direct ability to attract potential mates."

The study area was in the Kiskunsag National Park, 50 km south of Budapest, Hungary (47 degrees 08'N; 19 degrees 07'E) and we compared areas of high and low predator incidence. Females spent longest incubating the eggs whereas males spent longest guarding the nests and both parents least timt foraging during those daily periods when predator incidence was highest, i.e. the activities of the parents were adjusted to take account of avian predator presence. Reproductive defence priorities for males were confirmed by the observation that they made more attacks and spent more time guarding the nest than did females and that their daily peak guarding activity coincided with peak predator presence. Parents showed a trade-off in activity that was related to the level of predator incidence. At high incidence of predators, the increased incubation by females and the increased nest guarding by males, which were responsible for a decline in foraging activity by both parents, were apparently an effective defence since these parents did not suffer greater clutch loss due to nest predation than did parents nesting in areas with lower incidence of avian predators."

Previous studies revealed that the predation pressure provided by carabids significantly regulates the ecological network of invertebrates. Nevertheless, there is no direct estimation of the predation risk on carabids, which can be an important proxy for the phenomenon called ecological trap. In our study, we aimed to explore the predation pressure on carabids using 3D-printed decoys installed in two types of forestry treatments, preparation cuts and clear cuts, and control plots in a Hungarian oak-hornbeam forest. We estimated the seasonal, diurnal and treatment-specific aspects of the predation pressure on carabids. Our results reveal a significantly higher predation risk on carabids in both forestry treatments than in the control. Moreover, it was also higher in the nighttime than daytime. Contrarily, no effects of season and microhabitat features were found. Based on these clues we assume that habitats modified by forestry practices may act as an ecological trap for carabids. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how ecological interactions between species may change in a modified forest environment."

We used video cameras to monitor sentinel monarch eggs and fourth instars on milkweed in southern Michigan to identify predators and determine if nocturnally-active species impose significant predation pressure. We observed ten arthropod taxa consuming monarch eggs and larvae, with 74% of egg predation events occurring nocturnally. Taxa observed attacking monarch eggs included European earwigs (Forficula auricularia L.), tree crickets (Oecanthus sp.), lacewing larvae (Neuroptera), plant bugs (Miridae), small milkweed bugs (Lygaeus kalmii Stal), ants (Formicidae), spiders (Araneae: Salticidae and other spp.), harvestmen (Opiliones), and velvet mites (Trombidiformes: Trombidiidae). Larvae were attacked by ground beetles (Calleida sp.), jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae), and spined soldier bugs (Podisus maculiventris Say).

This study was conducted in an urban park in Seoul, a metropolitan city with high population density and significant floating population and a region with high risk of dengue virus transmission. Mosquitoes were collected twice a month from May through October in 2015 using BG-Sentinel traps. The collected Ae. albopictus were used in blood meal source analysis and dengue virus detection, whereas in other captured mosquito species, only those fed on blood were used for blood meal source analysis. A total of 54,682 mosquitoes representing 7 genera and 12 species were collected. The blood meal sources for Ae. albopictus included mammals (71%), birds (26%), amphibians (2%), and fish (1%). In mammals, the major blood meal source was humans (61.1%). No dengue virus was detected in captured samples. However, since the results for blood meal source indicate that Ae. albopictus feed almost exclusively on humans, this mosquito is likely to become a major vector of dengue virus, once this virus enters the mosquito."

This may be due to differences in the biology of local Anopheles gambiae, the only vector on the islands. Survival rate and feeding frequency are two factors influencing vectorial capacity. Anophelines generally feed just once per gonotrophic (oviposition) cycle. Newly emerged insects, however, may feed two or more times during their first oviposition cycle thus increasing the likelihood of becoming infected. The reasons for multiple feeding are not clearly understood and it is still uncertain whether the behaviour is facultative or obligatory. We, therefore, determined survival and sporozoite rates, and examined the behaviour of An. gambiae from the two islands during their first gonotrophic cycle. Methods: The wing size of 1,410, abdominal condition of 687, gonotrophic age and mated status of 7,264 female M form An. gambiae collected by light-trap, landing catch, resting outdoors or in copula, was determined from four sites in the archipelago. Sporozoite rates assessed by ELISA in 15,533 females from Sao Tome and 2,111 from Principe were determined. Results: Estimated survival rates ranged between 0.834-0.849 per day in Sao Tome and 0.801- 0.818 per day in Principe. Sporozoite rates of 0.63% in Sao Tome were significantly higher than the 0.24% from Principe. Overall 49% of females mated on the second night after emergence before feeding, and 51% on the third night and thus fed before mating. The likelihood of mating before feeding increased with wing size. None of the 3,776 parous insects collected showed evidence of recent mating. All but two of the 198 females collected in copula had undeveloped ovaries. Mean wing sizes and the number of insects collected in a sentinel light-trap varied but the proportion of newly emerged insects in the collection did not. The estimated survival rate of the smallest insects was lower than other size groups, but the overall size distribution of each age group was normal. Parous insects were gonotrophically concordant. Conclusion: Differences in mosquito survival contributed to the lower sporozoite rates and endemicity of malaria on Principe compared to Sao Tome. On both islands all newly emerged insects blood fed on the second night following emergence but only became gonotrophically active on the third night after emergence. Smaller insects had a higher 'mortality/emigration' rate than larger ones. We suggest that insufficiency of Juvenile Hormone until the third day of adult life is responsible for gonotrophic inactivity and that by partitioning mating between the second or thirdday after emergence females maximise their chances of out-crossing."

Earth Observation (EO) is a valuable data source for detecting exposed soils on a large scale. In the last couple of years, the multitemporal compositing technique has been used for the generation of so-called exposed soil composites that overcome the limitation of temporarily coverage of the soils with vegetation as it is occurring at agricultural sites. The selection of exposed soil pixels from the stack of multispectral images is mainly done using spectral reflectance indices such as NDVI, NBR2 and others calculated on a per-pixel basis. The definition of the thresholds that are applicable to large areas such as regions, countries or continents is still a challenge and requires a reliable and robust sampling data base. In this study, the Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) is used to build exposed soil masks containing all pixels in a given time period showing at least once exposed soil. For this purpose, a modified vegetation index (PV) based on the NDVI is used to separate the soils from other land cover (LC) classes by two PV thresholds. The overall goal of this study is to derive and validate exposed soil masks from multi-year Landsat data stacks for Germany from 1984 to 2019. The first focus is set on the impact of a newly developed sampling approach of LC classes such as urban areas, deciduous forests and agricultural fields that are automatically derived from Corine Land Cover (CLC) data. The spectral-temporal behavior of these LC classes in PVmin/ max index composites show larger variability of the PV values compared to a manual sampling for selective LC classes such as urban areas. It reveals that the threshold definition method previously developed by Rogge et al. (2018) is not robust enough and the percentile rule used to define the Tmax threshold had to be adapted from 0.995 to 0.900. On the other hand, the sampling data base has proven to be robust across time and region. The second focus of the paper is to validate all generated exposed soil masks covering Germany for seven time periods from 1984 to 2019. A linear correlation analysis was performed comparing the SCMaP data with surveys from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) and the CLC inventories. The comparison with both datasets showed high regression coefficients (R2 = 0.79 to 0.90) with small regional deviations for areas in the Northern part of Germany. Strong correlation was found for time periods based on a higher number of cloud free Landsat images such as from 2000 to 2009. This demonstrates the high potential of SCMaP's to generate exposed soil masks based on an automated sampling and a robust threshold derivation. To contribute to soil erosion studies that need information about where and when soils are bare, accurate exposed soil masks in suitable time periods can be of great value."
"Weeks, P",Red-billed oxpeckers: vampires or tickbirds?,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,11,154,160,10.1093/beheco/11.2.154,2000,"Many recent studies have shown that classic examples of mutualism are either far more complicated than originally believed, or that they are not mutualisms at all. Red-billed oxpeckers (Buphagus erythrorhynchus) are just such an example of an adaptive story. These small birds feed almost exclusively on what they can glean from the skin of large African mammals. The relationship is obligate for the birds, and it is generally assumed that hosts benefit through a reduction in tick load. Although widely accepted in the literature, this theory has never been tested in the field. I excluded oxpeckers from cattle as part of a controlled field experiment in Zimbabwe to test this idea. Changes in adult tick loads were unaffected by excluding the birds. In addition, oxpeckers significantly prolonged the healing time of wounds and removed earwax. These results suggest that the oxpecker-mammal relationship is more complex than was previously thought."

This represents an excellent opportunity to investigate and improve our understanding of the behavior of extremely slow landslides, as well as of the long- to short-term controls of their activity. In urban settings, such landslides deserve special attention, as their cumulative movements can cause significant socio-economic damage. Here, we re-examine the case of a long-lived, deep-seated landslide in the Apennine Mountains (Italy) which was urbanized between the late 1970s and early 2000s. The case provides a rare opportunity to highlight the benefits of the integrated analysis of long-term (several years) borehole inclinometer measurements with 15 years of multi-temporal InSAR displacement data. We present evidence of the landslide composite nature and asymmetry, and draw attention to the recent period of accelerated movement that coincided with the foot failure event. This helps constraining the interpretation of the borehole and InSAR data and demonstrating the predominantly rotational landslide mechanism. We show how a detailed analysis of sparse inclinometer and more spatially continuous InSAR measurements, when combined with local rainfall records, can reveal long- to short-term patterns of temporal variability in landslide motions and allow anticipating the consequences of future landslide activity."

One of these functions, regulation of herbivorous insects by predators, shapes tropical communities through cascading trophic effects. An improved understanding of how predation pressure on herbivorous insects varies with reforestation strategy, management decisions, and landscape context would guide restoration practice. We measured predation pressure by birds and arthropods on dummy caterpillars in five forest types in Panama. These land covers represent natural and managed forest conditions: non-native monoculture plantation, native multispecies plantation, young natural forest succession, secondary gallery forest, and old-growth forest. We also placed dummy caterpillars in residential countryside, a heavily disturbed nonforest land cover. In three land covers, we surveyed bird communities to examine the relationship between predator abundance and predation pressure. Predation pressure from birds was lowest in the intensively managed plantations and highest in land covers with structurally complex vegetation: successional forest, gallery forest, and residential countryside. In the non-native plantation, bird predation increased with proximity to gallery forest. We found strong correspondence between bird abundance and bird attacks on dummy caterpillars. Arthropod predation pressure was highest in the native plantation but, unlike bird predation pressure, did not vary strongly by land cover. Our results suggest that ecosystem functions by insectivorous birds can be enhanced on reforestation lands by incorporating unmanaged areas and tolerating nonplanted understory vegetation. We recommend that, regardless of management objectives, forest managers adopt a holistic approach to reforestation to facilitate recovery of animal-dependent ecosystem functions."

Collared peccaries are herbivores and depend upon vegetation for food and cover. Coyotes (Canis latrans) are sympatric with collared peccaries and, in some areas, are significant predators of collared peccaries. Coyotes can affect prey populations directly by killing individuals and indirectly by influencing behavior, habitat use, and activity patterns. We evaluated the habitat use of collared peccaries in burned and unburned areas without coyotes present in 1998 and both with and without coyotes present in 2000. Collared peccaries used vegetation associations in the enclosure nonrandomly (P < 0.10), with less use of burned areas than unburned areas. However, coyotes did not appear to influence habitat use of collared peccaries in the enclosure."

Environmental noise, however, may disrupt the ability of animals to gather information in their environment. Therefore, social interactions could be disrupted by environmental noise, or adapted to mitigate the costs associated with compromised perception in noisy environments. Here we tested whether the presence of water caustics, a natural form of visual noise prevalent within shallow aquatic habitats, affects the social decisions of shoaling fish. In a classic experimental paradigm, individual three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, were given a choice between two conspecific shoals differing in size while immersed in different levels of visual noise. Fish showed greater social attraction towards conspecifics as noise levels increased, measured by a reduction in the distance they maintained from others. While sticklebacks only showed clear preferences for groups that had at least four more members than another group, there was no evidence that visual noise level influenced fish's preference to associate with these larger shoals, nor did it change the preferences for other shoal sizes. Our findings suggest that, at the group sizes tested, visual noise increases individual stickleback's social attraction towards conspecifics, but does not affect their decision to associate with the larger of two groups. Such changes to social behaviour may reflect the consequences of having a reduced ability to sample private, but not social, information in noisy environments. (c) 2021 The Authors.

To ascertain how group-foraging goats (Capra hircus) deal with these trade-offs, we asked 1) do goats use social information to make foraging decisions and 2) how do they adjust their intake rate in light of having attracted by other group members? To establish whether goats use social information, we recorded their initial choice of different quality food patches when they were ignorant of patch quality and when they could observe others foraging. After determining that goats use social information, we recorded intake rates while they fed alone and in the presence of potential competitors. Intake rate increased as the number of competitors increased. Interestingly, lone goats achieved an intake rate that was higher than when one competitor was present but similar to when two or more competitors were present. Faster intake rates may allow herbivores to ingest a larger portion of the available food before competing group members arrive at the patch. This however, does not explain the high intake rates achieved when the goats were alone. We provide 2 potential explanations: 1) faster intake rates are a response to greater risk incurred by lone individuals, the loss of social information, and the fear of being left behind by the group and 2) when foraging alone, intake rate is no longer a trade-off between reducing competition and acquiring social information. Thus, individuals are able to feed close to their maximum rate."

I investigated monospecific and heterospecific grouping by sibling species, eastern (Macropus giganteus) and western grey kangaroos (M.fuliginosus), together with smaller and less social red-necked wallabies (M. rufogriseus). I observed groups feeding in mornings and evenings on a grassy airfield in the Grampians National Park, western Victoria, Australia. Wallabies formed smaller monospecific groups than the kangaroos, maintained a greater nearest-neighbor distance, and moved more while feeding. Monospecific groups of the two kangaroo species were indistinguishable in size, composition, spacing, and feeding rates. The percentage of individual grey kangaroos feeding increased with group size in monospecific groups of up to six. Heterospecific groups of kangaroos formed frequently, and the percentage of individual eastern and western greys feeding was not affected by species composition of groups, suggesting that conspecifics and heterospecifics were equally valuable as feeding partners. By contrast, the-re were few associations between kangaroos and wallabies."
"STANFORD, CB",THE INFLUENCE OF CHIMPANZEE PREDATION ON GROUP-SIZE AND ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR IN RED COLOBUS MONKEYS,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,49,577,587,,1995,"The extent to which predation influences the grouping patterns and behavioural ecology of non-human primates is a matter of continuing debate, but there are few held studies in which predation has been observed frequently enough to test the hypothesis that predation is an important influence. Group size and anti-predator behaviour of red colobus monkeys, Colobus badius tephrosceles, were studied in relation to predation by chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Predation by Gombe chimpanzees had a major impact on red colobus group size and structure. Mean group size of red colobus living in the core hunting area of their chimpanzee predators was 46% smaller than the mean size of groups living in the periphery of the chimpanzees' hunting range. Chimpanzees fed mainly upon immature red colobus monkeys at Gombe, and predation by chimpanzees was the likely limiting factor on red colobus group size and population size. Despite high levels of predation, there were few differences between large and small groups in likely predator avoidance behaviour: foraging and resting height, or nearest-neighbour proximity, for any age/sex class when they were not in the proximity of chimpanzees. When parties of chimpanzees were present the spatial positioning of colobus changed; females and immatures increased their nearest-neighbour scores to adult males, and adult males decreased their nearest-neighbour distances as a part of their communal defence tactics. Predation by chimpanzees elicits different detection and defence strategies from red colobus than do aerial (raptors) or terrestrial (felids) ambush predators. This appears to be owing to the social nature of chimpanzee hunting and the effect of chimpanzee party size and composition on hunting success."

Because of their small body size, in combination with their solitary and nocturnal life style, it has been suggested that they mainly rely on crypsis to evade predators. However, recent studies revealed that nocturnal primates are not generally cryptic and that they exhibit predator-specific escape strategies as well as alarm calls. In order to add to this new body of research, we studied anti-predator strategies of nocturnal grey mouse lemurs experimentally. In order to elicit anti-predator behaviour and alarm calls, we conducted experiments with a carnivore-, snake- and raptor model. We also conducted playback experiments with mouse lemur alarm calls to characterize their function. In response to predator models, they exhibited a combination of anti-predator strategies: in response to carnivore and snake models, mouse lemurs monitored the predator, probably to assess the potential risk that emanates from the predator. In response to raptor models they behaved cryptically and exhibited freezing behaviour. All mouse lemurs, except one individual, did not alarm call in response to predator models. In addition, during playback experiments with alarm calls, recorded during real predator encounters, mouse lemurs did not emit alarm calls nor did they show any escape behaviour. Thus, as in other nocturnal primates/mammals, mouse lemurs do not seem to rely on routinely warning of conspecifics against nearby predators."

Studies aimed at understanding audience effects have typically examined effects of conspecific audiences on signaller communication. Less work has focused on heterospecific audiences, which present an important avenue of research for species that participate in mixed-species groups. Here we experimentally tested mixed-species flocks of Carolina chickadees, Poecile carolinensis, and tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor, for conspecific and heterospecific audience effects. Birds were trapped from naturally occurring flocks and held in seminatural outdoor aviaries, where we recorded calling. We found that chickadees and titmice were sensitive to the number of conspecifics in flocks when communicating via 'chick-a-dee' calls, which are social cohesion calls produced by both species. Chickadees also were sensitive to the number of titmice in flocks, but chick-a-dee calling behaviour in titmice did not differ with regard to the number of chickadees in flocks. Furthermore, when subject to playbacks of simulated risk, chickadees and titmice produced more chick-a-dee calls when more titmice were in a flock. After these playbacks, chickadees produced fewer chick-a-dee calls with increasing numbers of conspecifics in flocks, whereas titmice produced more chick-a-dee calls with increasing numbers of conspecifics in flocks. These results suggest that chickadees and titmice are sensitive to social factors within their mixed-species flocks when communicating, and that chickadees appear more sensitive to heterospecific presence than do titmice. We suggest this is due to the dominance status of the species in these flocks, where titmice are typically dominant over chickadees. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Alert distance (the distance between an animal and an approaching human at which point the animal begins to exhibit alert behaviours to the human) has been proposed as an indicator of tolerance mainly for waterbirds; however, little is known about its utility for other bird species. The factors that influenced alert distances of four bird species to pedestrian approaches in five large wooded fragments in the city of Madrid (Spain) were analysed. Location of human activity affected only Passer domesticus alert distances, which increased in the proximity of pathways. Habitat structure modified alert distances of all the species (Passer domesticus, Turdus merula, Columba palumbus, and Pica pica), increasing bird tolerance with greater availability of escape cover (shrub and coniferous cover, and shrub height). Alert distances varied among species, with large species being less tolerant of human disturbance than small ones. Alert distance appears to be a more conservative indicator of tolerance than flight distances, because it includes a buffer zone (the difference between alert and flight distance) in which birds may adapt their reaction to the behaviour of visitors. Alert distance may be used in the determination of minimum approaching areas, allowing people to enjoy their visit to parks, and birds to use patches for foraging and breeding without being displaced."

We explored the relative importance of these effects in determining first response delays (the time elapsed between the 'detectors' leaving and the start of the rest of the flock's escape) and main response delays (time taken for all nondetectors to escape) among redshank flocks to three stimuli that posed different levels of risk (an attacking hawk, an approaching harmless species and a stimulus that did not involve any obvious external threat). There was strong support for the economic hypothesis because first response delays increased with flock size during responses to low-risk stimuli, when we assume the cost of not escaping immediately was lower because of increasing benefits from the dilution and confusion effects. There was also strong support for the perceptual limit hypothesis because main response delays were explained entirely by spacing and got quicker as flock size increased. This suggests that, once the rest of the flock started to respond to the detectors, benefits gained through the dilution and confusion effects decreased rapidly, so that immediate escape was the optimal response. Escape response delays can therefore be explained by both hypotheses and we discuss the implications of our results for group-living theory.

The European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was originally described as solitarily living forest-dwelling species. In recent decades, it has expanded its range into urban and agricultural areas forming large aggregations in open habitats. Captive en-vironments are thought to mimic some challenges encountered in rapidly changing habitats, however, to date no study has assessed how roe deer social structure changes in captive conditions. In this study, we explored the social network of a small group of captive and unrelated roe deer over the course of a ten-month period using camera traps. We found that the roe deer established a temporally stable and non-random social network with the buck as the most central and dominant individual. In addition, we analysed affiliative interactions, which have not been described in roe deer yet. We found that the affiliation network consisted not only of preferential associations between the buck and other females, but also between females, whereby a young female played a central role. The seasonal changes in roe deer' gregariousness observed in the wild were also observed in the captive population with an increase in association strength and social interactions in autumn. These results suggest that roe deer kept in a group setting in captivity seem to flexibly adjust their social behaviour; thus, supporting the assumption that roe deer show a high social flexibility that facilitates adaptations to various habitats."

Heuristically, mental fatigue refers to a feeling of tiredness or exhaustion, and a disengagement from the task at hand; it manifests as impaired cognitive and behavioral performance. In order to effectively reduce the undesirable yet preventable consequences of mental fatigue in many real-world workspaces, a better understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms is needed, and continuous efforts have been devoted to this topic. In comparison with conventional univariate approaches, which are widely utilized in fatigue studies, convergent evidence has shown that multivariate functional connectivity analysis may lead to richer information about mental fatigue. In fact, mental fatigue is increasingly thought to be related to the deviated reorganization of functional connectivity among brain regions in recent studies. In addition, graph theoretical analysis has shed new light on quantitatively assessing the reorganization of the brain functional networks that are modulated by mental fatigue. This review article begins with a brief introduction to neuroimaging studies on mental fatigue and the brain connectome, followed by a thorough overview of connectome studies on mental fatigue. Although only a limited number of studies have been published thus far, it is believed that the brain connectome can be a useful approach not only for the elucidation of underlying neural mechanisms in the nascent field of neuroergonomics, but also for the automatic detection and classification of mental fatigue in order to address the prevention of fatigue-related human error in the near future.

"Rottenborn, SC",The use of coastal agricultural fields in Virginia as foraging habitat by shorebirds,WILSON BULLETIN,108,783,796,,1996,"I studied temporal abundance patterns and use of cover types by shorebirds foraging in coastal croplands on the eastern shore of Virginia from March 1991 through February 1992. A total of 21,254 shorebirds of 21 species was observed foraging in agricultural croplands. Shorebird abundance reached a peak during spring migration and was lower during fall and winter. Shorebird species richness was highest in fall and lower in spring and winter. Some species appeared to use fields primarily as alternate foraging habitat when preferred intertidal habitats were covered by high tides, whereas other species foraged in fields regardless of tidal height. Most species showed highly significant positive associations with plowed fields (bare earth) and negative associations with herbaceous vegetation >10 cm tall. Associations with vegetated cover of <10 cm varied seasonally, tending to be positive in spring and negative (or with no association) in fall and winter for most species. Because most shorebirds foraged on the cover type providing the least cover from predators (plowed fields), the observed cover associations may reflect differences in predator detection or foraging efficiency among the cover types."

Some habitat features could provide both thermal and security cover, or both concealment and escape cover; but in other cases, habitat features such as vegetation could impose a tradeoff between opposing functions of cover. Cover that conceals an animal from a predator also could reduce the animal's visibility and thus, its ability to detect a predator early enough to escape capture. We quantified the opposing functional properties of cover (concealment and visibility) and evaluated the relationship between these properties using continuous measures in sagebrush-steppe and grassland habitats. We hypothesized that concealment and visibility would be inversely related and that the slope of this relationship would differ among sites with varying density and patchiness of shrub vegetation, imposing differing tradeoff scenarios. Concealment and visibility were inversely, but not perfectly related, implying that animals must make tradeoffs between the properties of cover, but they could achieve higher levels of one property while giving up relatively less of the other. In addition, we examined potential tradeoffs by pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis) by comparing concealment and visibility at locations used by rabbits with measurements collected at random locations. At a small scale, pygmy rabbits traded off visibility for concealment in dense and sparse vegetation, but not in patchy vegetation. Although cover is an intuitively simple concept, it is functionally more complex, and this study provides insight into the opposing mechanisms of cover that might influence habitat use. Our work provides an initial step towards more fully understanding how cover functionally relates to predation risk."

Inequalities between individuals represent a major force driving patterns of animal dispersion. Here we use a novel approach to the analysis of feeding competition in large groups, based on photographic sequences of barnacle goose flocks over time. The spatial distributions of individuals derived from these photos were used to describe how individual feeding performance may be affected by patch depletion caused by other members of the flock. This was assessed indirectly by estimating the variation in prior grazing time experienced by individuals.2. The most successful foragers in a flock (i.e. those experiencing the least prior grazing time) are largely unaffected by depletion arising during the life span of the flock, while the least successful foragers experience very substantial depletion. Furthermore, for the less successful individuals, the average level of depletion increases continuously with both flock size and time spent in the flock.3. Skew in depletion experienced could not be assessed accurately, although it is likely that there is moderate right skew, i.e. a few individuals do very badly, but more than half do better than the mean.4. This study suggests that the degree of depletion experienced is related to position within the group, while previous studies of this system have shown that there is strong competition for the better positions. Dominance status is therefore likely to be a strong determinant of feeding performance. Subordinate individuals, being unable to obtain leading positions, may be forced to adopt alternative strategies to improve feeding performance, such as moving more frequently in order to maximize time in smaller or more recently formed groups."

Several studies have highlighted the link between tadpole group density and their activity level, confirming that, usually, living in groups brings several antipredator benefits. However, nearly all studies have focused on the average behavioural responses of tadpoles tested in groups. In this study, we explored the effects of living in groups of three different sizes (1, 5 and 25 individuals per group) on the antipredator behaviour of individual green toad, Bufotes balearicus, tadpoles. We first assessed their basal activity and then examined changes in mobility rate and total distance after exposure to the chemical cues of predatory dragonfly, Aeshna cyanea, larvae. For both the preand poststimulus activity levels, we also tested the effects of the presence of conspecifics' chemical cues in the experimental tub. Our results showed that (1) a previous brief (8 days) experience of group living is sufficient to affect the basal level of activity of individual tadpoles, which increased with group size; (2) tadpoles that were reared alone did not lower their activity further when exposed to predators' odour; (3) the antipredator response of high density-reared tadpoles decreased in the presence of conspecifics' cues, supporting the so-called dilution effect, which, anyway, may need a minimum group size to be apparent. We conclude that both previous group-rearing experience and current perception of the surrounding environment may affect anti predator behaviour in individual tadpoles.

Elk behavioral responses to wolf- and human-predation risk were similar; however, responses to human-predation risk were stronger than responses to wolf-predation risk. These results suggest that predation risk from wolves or human hunters may result in elk spending more time on private rangelands away from public-land winter ranges, which may exacerbate problems of landowner tolerance of elk on livestock pastures. However, increased movement and changing grouping patterns on winter ranges may also disperse elk grazing impacts and lessen elk impacts on any one area.

The restrictions issued in many places due to COVID-19 provide a rare opportunity to examine wildlife behavior in nature reserves with reduced human presence, and to reveal the impact of human visitation on the behaviors and fitness of local wildlife species. In 2019 and 2020 we placed trail cameras next to two natural springs in the Israeli Negev Desert, Ein-Avdat and Ein-Shaviv, located 9 km apart. Both sites serve as the main water source for local Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) populations, but Ein-Avdat is situated within a popular national park into which visitors' entrance was restricted due to COVID-19 regulations in 2020, while Ein-Shaviv is more remote and thus attracts only few visitors regardless of COVID-19 regulations. Our study revealed that during 2020, ibex in Ein-Avdat arrived to drink earlier in the day and the population's Female:Kids ratio more than doubled. These changes were not observed in Ein-Shaviv. We found that the daily number of visitors in Ein-Avdat affected the arrival time of ibex to the water pool. We conclude that the reduced number of visitors to Ein-Avdat in 2020 compared to 2019 may have allowed ibex to arrive in preferred hours, and may have contributed to the increased kid-to-females ratio. Our study shows that behavioral adaptions to human visitation in nature reserves might carry a high fitness cost."

Gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) are overrepresented in the diets of crowned eagles in Kibale National Park, Uganda, and adult male mangabeys are represented more than females. We focused on the behavior of adult male gray-cheeked mangabeys living in social groups in Kibale National Park (1) to clarify the interactions between mangabeys and eagles that might put adult males at greater risk and (2) to better understand individual variation in behavioral responses to predators. Adult male mangabeys in five groups responded to observer-confirmed presence of crowned eagles 88 times over a 13-month period. While all males gave alarm calls, only the highest-ranking male in each of four groups chased eagles. These males had elevated levels of fecal cortisol metabolites in the days immediately after they engaged in active defense, suggesting that they perceived such behavior as risky. In the one group where male ranks were unstable and there were no infants, no male was observed to chase eagles. We suggest that males pursue the dangerous tactic of chasing eagles only when they are likely to have offspring in the group. Males in larger groups also spent less time alarm calling to crowned eagles (from first to last call in a group), and our observations confirmed that the duration of their alarm calls was related to eagle presence. Thus, eagles spent less time around larger mangabey groups. Alarm calling by adult male mangabeys may signal to this ambush predator that it has been detected and should move on."

We used observations of coyotes (Canis latrans) hunting deer to test whether the distance at which white-tails and mule deer alerted to coyotes was related to their vulnerability to predation. Coyote encounters with both species were more likely to escalate when deer alerted at shorter distances. However, coyote encounters with mule deer progressed further than encounters with white-tails that alerted at the same distance, and this was nor due to species differences in group size or habitat. We then conducted an experiment in which a person approached groups of deer to compare the detection abilities and the form of alert response for white-tails and mule deer, and for age groups within each species. Mule deer alerted to the approacher at longer distances than white-tails, even after controlling for variables that were potentially confounding. Adult females of both species alerted sooner than conspecific juveniles. Mule deer almost always looked directly at the approacher as their initial response, whereas white-tails were more likely to flee or to look in another direction with no indication that they pinpointed the approacher during the trial. Mule deer may have evolved the ability to detect predators earlier than white-tails as an adaptation to their more open habitats, or because they need more time to coordinate subsequent anti-predator defenses.Corresponding author: Susan Lingle, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.

"Blumstein, DT",Quantifying predation risk for refuging animals: A case study with golden marmots,ETHOLOGY,104,501,516,,1998,"Although a variety of behaviors expose animals to some risk of predation, there is no accepted way to compare their relative risk. For animals that retreat to refugia when alarmed by predators, the proportion of time devoted to each out-of-refuge behavior multiplied by the total time required to return to a refuge can be used to compare a behavior's relative predation risk. Total time to return to a refuge is a function of both response time - the time required to respond to an increased risk of predation-and travel time-the time required to flee to a refuge once alarmed. Quantifying these components can illustrate how animals minimize exposure to predators. Golden marmots (Marmota caudata aurea) were a refuging prey species used to examine the utility of this measure and to understand how marmots minimized their risk of exposure to predation. Golden marmots devoted different amounts of time to looking, foraging, self-grooming, and playing. To estimate the behavior-specific time required to return to refugia, the location of different activities was noted and a behavior-specific travel time was calculated. Alarm calls were played back to marmots engaged in different behaviors to determine, in a standardized manner, if there were behavior-specific response times. Marmots appeared to minimize their predation risk by performing most behaviors close to refugia. Results suggest that foraging was the riskiest behavior, largely because marmots foraged far from refugia and spent about 30% of their time foraging. While sample sizes were small, results also suggested that play, a rare adult behavior, exposed animals to predation because of a relatively long response time."

However, some studies suggested that the number of neighbours under surveillance may play a more important role in affecting food intake rate than flock size. In addition, the effect of the number of neighbours should also depend on the position of an individual within a flock. To test these hypotheses, we examined the effects of flock size, number of neighbours and position within a flock on foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate of wintering greater white-fronted geese, Anser albifrons. We observed the foraging behaviours of 490 individual geese from 71 flocks during December 2016-March 2017 at Shengjin Lake, Anhui, China. We found that mean foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate were not influenced by flock size, whereas, at the individual scale these variables were significantly affected by the number of neighbours and position within a flock. Moreover, the effect of the number of neighbours on the foraging parameters did not differ between central and peripheral individuals, despite central individuals always having greater foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate regardless of the number of neighbours. Both the decreased foraging time and decreased foraging efficiency indicated a potential increase in cryptic competition from neighbours. More neighbours contributed to a decreased intake rate. Our study highlights the possible effects of cryptic competition among neighbours on their foraging behaviour. We hypothesize that an increase in intraspecific competition between neighbours in areas of shrinking wetland habitats may contribute to population declines of wintering geese and other wildfowl.

A novel avian visual fixation strategy,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,72,,,10.1007/s00265-018-2455-0,2018,"A central assumption in behavioral research is that the observer knows where an animal is looking; however, establishing when an animal is gazing (i.e., visually fixating on an object) has been challenging in species with laterally placed eyes. We quantitatively tested three fixation strategies proposed in the literature for birds, using European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). We did not find strong support for any of the three strategies, despite high statistical a priori power (93%). However, we did observe a new visual fixation strategy that we labeled monocular alternating fixation. In this strategy, starlings moved their heads to make multiple fixations with a single eye before switching to the other eye and repeating the same process. Additionally, we established that individuals favored using the left over the right eye, supporting that laterality in starlings is left-eye dominant. The newly observed fixation strategy may be associated with the high level of intra-retinal variation (density of photoreceptors, overall sensitivity of visual pigments, etc.) in the starling retina. From a functional perspective, this monocular alternating fixation strategy may be beneficial to integrate the different types of information gathered by the different portions of each retina more quickly. We discuss the implications of our results for designing and interpreting behavioral experiments that require an understanding of where a bird is looking.Significance statementThis is the first study to quantitatively test three hypotheses in the literature about how animals with laterally placed eyes look at objects. We found that there was not strong support for any of these three strategies, but found support for a newly described strategy for birds to look at objects (i.e., multiple looks with a single eye before switching to the other eye)."

In nonhuman primates, social grooming has been used to test predictions in both contexts: reciprocal altruism or biological markets. Specifically, in species in which males cannot coerce females to mate, males may attempt to interchange grooming for mating, particularly when females are fertile and mating opportunities are more likely to arise. We tested whether wild white-handed gibbon males from Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, increased their grooming activity when the female partner was fertile. Adult females and males of our study population are codominant (in terms of aggression), they live in pairs or small multimale groups and mate promiscuously. We analysed grooming episodes during 2760 observation-hours in 12 groups separately for females' reproductive condition (cycling/pregnant/lactating) based on noninvasive measures of ovarian hormone activity. We found that males groomed females more than vice versa and more grooming was exchanged when females were cycling than during pregnancy or lactation. The number of copulations/day was elevated when females were cycling, and females copulated more frequently with males on days when they received more grooming. When males increased their grooming efforts, females also increased their grooming of males, perhaps to equalize give and take. Although grooming might be reciprocated because of intrinsic benefits of receiving grooming, we conclude that males also interchange grooming as a commodity for sexual opportunities during a female's fertile period.

This stock is currently under a three-year management cycle, and the current assessment provided catch advice for 2016-18. The assessment also identified an indicator (based on 3 year projections of DFO research vessel (RV) total (2+) biomass) that could be used to determine whether a full assessment is warranted during interim years. The current assessment was based mainly on a new state-space population dynamics model (Northern Cod Assessment Model, NCAM) that integrates much of the existing information about the productivity of the stock. Key features of the new model are that it provides annual estimates of natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) rates along with measures of uncertainty; the model also estimates catch and requires an interval identifying a likely range of catch (upper and lower bounds). The model integrates information from DFO RV autumn trawl surveys (1983-2015), Sentinel fishery surveys (1995-2014), inshore acoustic surveys (1995-2009) fishery catch age compositions, and partial fishery landings (1983-2015), and tagging (1983-2015). The latest assessment indicated that stock abundance (ages 2+) has increased from 194 million cod in 2005 to 894 million in 2015. Total biomass (ages 2+) has increased from 78 Kt in 2005 to 539 Kt in 2015. Spawning stock biomass (SSB) has increased from 25 Kt in 2005 to 300 Kt in 2015. Recruitment (age 2) improved slightly in the last decade and the average number of age 2s from the 2011-13 year classes corresponds to about 25% of the numbers of age 2s observed in year classes of the 1980s. Stock status is improving, increasing from 3% of Blim in 2005 to 34% of Blim in 2015, but SSB has been well into the critical zone since the stock collapse. Three year projections (to 2018) were also undertaken to investigate the potential impact of a range of catch options from zero catch (no fishing) to a 5-fold increase in catch, based on model estimates of total catch for 2015 (6,900 t). The results indicated a high probability of achieving a 3-year 28% SSB interim growth milestone over the full range of catch options. Projections also indicate a low risk (<4%) that SSB will decline by 2018 to below the 2015 value, but also a low probability (5-8%) that the stock will grow out of the critical zone and exceed Blim in 2018. The stock is projected to grow but still be much less than Blim (60-66%) and remain in the critical zone in 2018 over the full range of catch options considered, including no fishing. Consistency with the DFO decision-making framework incorporating the precautionary approach requires that removals from all sources must be kept at the lowest possible level until the stock clears the critical zone."
"Libra, Martin; Tulai, Salape; Novotny, Vojtech; Hrcek, Jan",Elevational contrast in predation and parasitism risk to caterpillars in a tropical rainforest,ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,167,922,931,10.1111/eea.12851,2019,"Invertebrate predators and parasitoids are among the most important natural enemies of insect herbivores. Yet, the strength of natural enemy pressure along an altitudinal gradient and interactions between the groups of natural enemies (such as predation on parasitized prey) are not well known. Various methods are used to reveal the mortality factors of herbivores. Predation pressure is usually assessed through exposure of artificial prey. However, this method cannot provide information about the attacks of parasitoids, or their eventual interactions with predators. Furthermore, artificial or dead prey might not attract predators because they do not show expected host behavior, and this method mostly cannot distinguish between predation and scavenging. For the first time in a tropical rainforest, we quantified elevational contrast in mortality factors using exposure of live caterpillars. We exposed a total of 800 live caterpillars of Talanga excelsalis moresbyensis Strand (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) on saplings of Ficus copiosa Steud. (Moraceae) at two elevations in primary tropical rain forest in Papua New Guinea (200 and 1 200 m a.s.l.). We exposed the caterpillars in two treatments: exposed to and protected from invertebrate predators and parasitoids. Disappearance of caterpillars was significantly higher in the exposed treatment. Furthermore, caterpillar disappearance was significantly higher in lowlands than in highlands (43 vs. 12%). We consider the vast majority of the disappearance to be due to predation, as migration of the caterpillars from the focal trees was not observed (except one caterpillar). This estimate of invertebrate predation rate corresponds with studies which used artificial caterpillar models. No significant difference in parasitism rate between the two elevations was observed (12 vs. 13%). The combination of the disappearance and parasitism rate patterns means that larval parasitoids face stronger pressure from invertebrate predators through higher predation of their hosts in the lowlands than in the highlands."
"Hegyi, Z; Sasvari, L",Costs and benefits of interspecific coloniality in breeding waders,FOLIA ZOOLOGICA,46,303,314,,1997,"Nest position, laying and hatching data, agressive interactions between foragers, and causes of hatching failures were recorded in lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), redshank (Tringa tetanus) and black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa) breeding on 380 ha of meadows in Kiskunsag National Park, 50 km south of Budapest (47 degrees 08'N; 19 degrees 07'E). Meadows were flooded artificially every autumn, but no water management or agricultural activities were carried out during the breeding seasons over the 8 year study period, 1988 - 1995. All three species laid clutches in their preferred nest sites during the early laying period, and this resulted in the formation of single-species colonies. Preferred nest sites for lapwings were areas of low vegetation a long way from the water. Godwits preferred high vegetation near the water, whereas redshanks showed a preference for areas mid way between the two latter. In preferred areas, where single species-colonies developed, the frequency of aggressive interactions was higher than in mixed colonies or on solitary nest sites. In mid and late laying periods, pairs nested in nonpreferred sites, presumably due to competition, and this produced mixed-species colonies or solitary nest sites. Lapwings benefited from reduced effects of predation and flooding by rainfall in three-species colonies, where they attained their highest hatching success. Godwits benefited from nesting with lapwings and achieved their highest hatching success in two-species colonies because they nested further from the water and lost fewer clutches from flooding than in single-species colonies. Redshanks suffered nest losses due to attacks of neighbouring lapwings and achieved their highest hatching success in two-species colonies where they bred with godwits. The conspecific and heterospecific interactions produced colonies with various compositions that reflected the balance of costs and benefits for each species to achieve its highest hatching success."
"Stears, Keenan; Shrader, Adrian M.",Increases in food availability can tempt oribi antelope into taking greater risks at both large and small spatial scales,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,108,155,164,10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.07.012,2015,"Differences in food availability and predation risk can influence how herbivores use landscapes. As a result, trade-offs between costs and benefits can influence habitat and patch selection. To determine how oribi antelope, Ourebia ourebi, weigh up costs and benefits when making habitat and patch level foraging decisions, we measured giving-up densities in artificial patches. First, we determined large-scale habitat use, and then explored how different variables explained patch use within habitats. When the availability of food within patches across the different habitats was equal, oribi preferred to feed in short and tall grasslands and avoided woodlands. Furthermore, the avoidance of woodlands extended into the surrounding grasslands, resulting in oribi feeding less intensively in grassland areas within 15 m of the woodlands. Within the safe grassland habitats, oribi preferred to feed in patches close to tall grass (i.e. escape cover), and where they could see beyond 2 m. These results suggest that oribi select habitats and patches in relation to perceived predation risk (i.e. predation costs outweigh potential food intake benefits). However, when we increased food availability within woodlands, oribi increased their large-scale risk-taking behaviour and fed in these woodlands. Furthermore, this increased risk taking extended to small-scale foraging decisions whereby an increase in food availability within woodlands caused oribi to increase their relative usage of patches that had sight lines as well as patches that were closer to potential ambush sites. Ultimately, these results highlight how changes in food availability can determine the degree to which herbivores are willing to increase their risk-taking behaviour, and how these changes can affect overall landscape use.

However, few studies have directly tested whether predation risk alters the way other variables influence prey behavior. Here we use information theory (Akaike's Information Criterion, AICc) in a novel way to test the hypothesis that the decision-making rules governing elk behavior are simplified by the presence of wolves. With elk habitat use as the dependent variable, we test whether the number of independent variables (i.e., the size of the models) that best predict this behavior differ when wolves are present vs absent. Thus, we use AICc scores simply to determine the number of variables to which elk respond when making decisions. We measured habitat use using 2,288 locations from GPS collars on 14 elk, over two winters (14 elk winters), in the Gallatin Canyon portion of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. We found that the use of three major habitat components (grass, conifer, sage) was sensitive to many variables on days that wolves were locally absent, with the best models (Delta AlCc <= 2) averaging 7.4 parameters. In contrast, habitat use was sensitive to few variables on days when wolves were present: the best models averaged only 2.5 parameters. Because fewer variables affect elk behavior in the presence of wolves, we conclude that elk use simpler decision-making rules in the presence of wolves. This simplification of decision-making rules implies that predation risk imposes selection pressures that do not allow prey to respond to other pressures in ways that they otherwise would. If the affected processes are important, then this indirect effect of predation is likely to be important."
"Templeton, JJ; Giraldeau, LA",Vicarious sampling: The use of personal and public information by starlings foraging in a simple patchy environment,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,38,105,114,10.1007/s002650050223,1996,"Group foragers may be able to assess patch quality more efficiently by paying attention to the sampling activities of conspecifics foraging in the same patch. In a previous field experiment, we showed that starlings foraging on patches of hidden food could use the successful foraging activities of others to help them assess patch quality. In order to determine whether a starling could also use another individual's lack of foraging success to assess and depart from empty patches more quickly, we carried out two experimental studies which compared the behaviour of captive starlings sampling artificial patches both when alone and when in pairs. Solitary starlings were first trained to assess patch quality in our experimental two-patch system, and were then tested on an empty patch both alone and with two types of partner bird. One partner sampled very few holes and thus provided a low amount of public information; the other sampled numerous holes and thus provided a high amount of public information. In experiment I, we found no evidence of vicarious sampling. Subjects sampled a similar number of empty holes when alone as when with the low and high information partners; thus they continued to rely on their own personal information to make their patch departure decisions. In experiment 2, we modified the experimental patches, increasing the ease with which a bird could watch another's sampling activities, and increasing the difficulty of acquiring accurate personal sampling information. This time, subjects apparently did use public information, sampling fewer empty holes before departure when with the high-information partner than when with the low-information partner, and sampling fewer holes when with the low-information partner than when alone. We suggest that the degree to which personal and public information are used is likely to depend both on a forager's ability to remember where it has already sampled and on the type of environment in which foraging takes place."
"Santoyo-Brito, Enrique; Nunez, Herman; Cooper, William E., Jr.; Fox, Stanley F.",Comparison of Escape Behavior Between Solitary and Grouped Liolaemus leopardinus Lizards from the Central Chilean Andes,HERPETOLOGICA,76,285,289,,2020,"Optimal escape theory states that animal prey counterbalance costs and risks before fleeing from predators. The theory seeks to explain the variation in distance between the predator and prey when the prey initiates flight (flight initiation distance [FID]). Although group living is commonly observed in the animal kingdom, it is not the predominant social behavior in squamates. Thus, studies of flight responses of grouped or social lizard species are very scarce. The Chilean lizard Liolaemus leopardinus is a highly social species and individuals of different age classes and sexes form social groups on rock outcrops where it is also common to observe solitary conspecifics. The flexible social behavior of L. leopardinus makes it a good model species to compare FID in solitary and grouped individuals. We measured escape behavior in solitary and grouped juvenile and adult L. leopardinus. We conducted trials on 61 solitary lizards and 14 grouped lizards (one focal individual in each group ; maximum group size = 3). We found that FID, with basking habitat temperature (BHT) as a covariate, was significantly shorter in grouped L. leopardinus. This is a novel finding for a social lizard. The correlation between FID and distance to nearest refuge (DNR) was not significant, and DNR and BHT were not different between solitary and grouped lizards. In total, 38 lizards entered a refuge (29 solitary and 9 grouped individuals), mostly rock refuges. In this subsample, the correlation between distance fled and DNR was highly significant. The FID of those individuals that entered a refuge was not different than that of individuals that did not enter a refuge (with BHT as a covariate). Our finding that FID was shorter in grouped lizards was consistent with (1) a dilution effect that decreases individual risk of predation and/or (2) coincidental cooperation for indirectly enhanced threat detection. In the second interpretation, grouped lizards may spend less time vigilant and more time thermoregulating, waiting for some signal of enhanced predation risk by other individuals in the group."

Among the biotic and abiotic factors acting to prompt plastic responses, the social environment has been proposed as being one of the primary modulating forces on behaviour. Being part of a group has particular influence on the expression of risky behaviour in that added eyes and ears serve to decrease a group member's vulnerability to predation resulting in the mean behavioural expression of behaviours such as activity and/or exploration increasing with group size. A large body of work has documented such group size effects. However, as this process may operate at the individual level it is unclear how the social environment affects the consistent expression of personality. Thus, we examined the interactive effects of behavioural phenotype and social context on the stability of individual behaviour in the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata. Lizards were exposed to a series of assays measuring activity, exploration and boldness in groups of one, two, four and eight. Repeatability was determined across group size treatments and the combined effects of social context and behavioural type on behavioural plasticity were assessed. We found that the predicted patterns of group size effects were only observed when each lizard's behavioural phenotype was considered. Inactive and shy lizards increased their behaviour with increasing group size whereas active and bold lizards exhibited the opposite pattern. Additionally, the degree to which an individual adjusted its behavioural response was contingent upon its behavioural phenotype, with slow lizards showing higher levels of responsiveness than fast lizards. Despite this plasticity, between-individual differences in the expression of activity, exploration and boldness persisted. Thus, our study provides strong evidence that the effects of an individual's personality are stronger than those of group size.(c)& nbsp;2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, supporting evidence remains scant. As part of a broader study of grey-cheeked mangabey, Lophocebus albigena, dispersal in Kibale National Park, Uganda between October 1996 to February 1999, we investigated starvation and mortality risks within a sample of 27 radiotagged mangabey males. Each male was contacted on average three times a week to collect data on spatial relations, habitat use, activity patterns and fates. We assessed risks by comparing data from 'isolated' (greater than or equal to 200 m from the group) males with data from 'within-group' males. We assessed starvation risks by comparing proportions of time spent in feeding, foraging and moving, comparing rates of movement during focal samples, and comparing proportions of time that males spent in different habitat types and canopy levels. We assessed mortality risks by comparing scanning rates and mortality events of within-group and isolated males. Isolated males spent significantly more time scanning, but we could detect no other significant differences in time allocated to different activities by the two categories of males. Nor could we detect differences between within-group and isolated males in the use of habitat types and canopy levels. At least three of five established mortality events involved males known to be isolated from groups. Given that males were found isolated only 11% of the time, it is estimated that isolated males were at least 12 times as likely to die as within-group males. These results suggest that dispersing males may not face increased risk of starvation, but are at higher risk of mortality (primarily through predation by eagles) than nondispersing males.

Proactive adjustments are generally well-studied, whereas the frequency, strength and duration of reactive adjustments remain largely unknown. We studied the space use and habitat selection of GPS-collared zebras Equus quagga from 2 to 48 h after an encounter with lions Panthera leo. Lion-zebra encounters generally occurred close to artificial waterholes (<1 km). Two hours after an encounter, zebras were more likely to have fled than stay when the encounter occurred in more risky bushy areas. During their flight, zebras selected grasslands more than usual, getting great visibility. Regardless of their initial response, zebras finally fled at the end of the night and reached areas located far from waterholes where encounters with lions are less frequent. The large-scale flights (similar to 4-5 km) of zebras led to a local zebra depression for lions. Zebras that had fled immediately after the encounter resumed their behaviour of coming close to waterholes on the following day. However, zebras that had initially stayed remained far from waterholes for an extra 24 h, remaining an elusive prey for longer. The delay in the flight decision had different short-term consequences on the lion-zebra game. We reveal that the spatial context of the encounter shapes the immediate response of prey, and that encountering predators induces strong behavioural responses: prey flee towards distant, safer, areas and have a constrained use of key resource areas which are at the heart of the predator-prey game at larger spatio-temporal scales. Nighttime encounters were infrequent (once every 35 days on average), zebra responses were short-lived (<36 h) but occurred over a large spatial scale (several km)."

By altering cost-benefit trade-offs of foraging, variations in group size and predation risk can influence plant selection by herbivores. This influence may vary seasonally, depending on how foraging constraints vary throughout the year. Empirical evidence of these combined effects remains limited, especially in natural settings. We evaluated the spatial association between wheat sedge, Carex atherodes, and bison, Bison bison, foraging under predation risk during summer and winter. To maximize their energy intake rate, bison should feed on Carex atherodes. We found that the strength of selection for foraging sites with C. atherodes decreased with increasing risk of wolf, Canis lupus, encounter in winter, but not in summer. Bison faced greater risk in winter than in summer. Selection for C. atherodes was further influenced by group size. Larger bison groups displayed stronger selection for C. atherodes in winter but weaker selection in summer. Seasonal variations in group-size effects can be explained by changes in the relative costs and benefits of social foraging. Bison groups are much larger in summer than winter, implying potentially stronger competition among bison foraging on C. atherodes in summer. Carex atherodes is more inconspicuous in winter than in summer, thereby increasing the value of social information during winter months. We suggest that predation risk and spatial heterogeneity of highly profitable food influence the foraging decisions of bison differently in summer and winter because of seasonal differences in cost-benefit trade-offs.

We analyzed long-term data of red deer (Cervus elaphus) group sizes collected at 3 timescales in Bialowieya Primeval Forest, Poland, from 1986 to 2003. On the daily scale, group size differed among periods of the day for females in summer (P = 0. 001) and autumn (P = 0.04) but not winter (P = 0. 18). Group size of males did not differ (P > 0.35) among the periods of day during any season. On the seasonal scale, both sexes had largergroup sizes in winter than summer, and males were always more solitary than females. At the annual scale, multiple-regression analysis explained 96% (r(2) = 0.957) of deer grouping patterns. Human hunting had the greatest influence (sr(i)(2) = 0.414), followed by acom crop (sr(i)(2) = 0.012) and snow cover (sr(i)(2) = 0.008). Intense hunting by humans during a 5-year period appeared to cause increases in group sizes, even while red deer densities decreased. The disruption of the normally positive relationship of deer density to group size apparently affected predator-prey relationships, consequently red deer numbers continued to decline even after hunting pressure was relaxed. Our results indicate caution should be used when reducing red deer numbers by dramatic increases in hunting because the resulting behavioral and ecological changes in deer have implications that extend well beyond the season and year, with important consequences for the long-term stability of the population, especially in areas where large carnivores are present."

When hunted, however, they may have to adjust their behaviour further or differently to cope with this additional mortality risk. Here, we investigated whether African large ungulates would adjust their behaviour in response to hunting risk (i.e. risk of being shot by human hunters). We predicted that they would shift their use of surface water, a key and scarce resource in African savannas, from day hours to night hours to reduce the risk of encountering human hunters. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes to record the temporal drinking niche of three nonhunted ungulates (i.e. impala, Aepyceros melampus, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, sable antelope, Hippotragus niger). We also monitored waterholes in hunting areas in the vicinity of Hwange National Park. In Hwange National Park, the three species avoided waterholes at night, when the risk of natural predation was higher. Conversely, in the hunting areas, all three species visited waterholes more often at night. Impala and greater kudu, however, were less prone to switch towards night-time use of waterholes in hunting areas compared to sable antelope, although all three species were exposed to similar hunting risk. Our results suggest that hunting may force African ungulates to shift their visits at waterholes from day hours towards night hours, but that the magnitude of this shift may be constrained by the predation risk imposed by large nocturnal carnivores. We conclude that species preyed upon by natural predators adjust their antipredator behaviour in response to the additional risk of predation imposed by hunting.

Group size was inversely correlated with understory coverage, and hazel grouse foraging alone used sites with more cover than hazel grouse foraging in flocks in both mixed forest and coniferous plantations. Groups were larger in forests with less understory coverage, but larger groups were also found at sites with more food. The winter diet of hazel grouse was mainly buds and catkins of trees in the genera Salix, Betula and Alnus."

In African savannas, human-mediated changes to woody cover affect perceptions of risk and foraging decisions by large herbivores. Through cafeteria-style feeding trials, we presented two common, browsing ungulates (Guenther's dik-dik [Madoqua guentheri] and impala [Aepyceros melampus]) with branches from four tree species that varied in their relative investment in mechanical and chemical defenses. We conducted trials in habitats that were perceived as risky to either dik-dik (i.e., open habitat) or impala (i.e., bushland habitat). We found that dik-dik preferred to eat thorny trees low in tannin content within bushland habitats, while the larger-bodied impala preferred tannin-rich but thorn-less branches within open habitats. Risk-induced habitat use homogenized browsing pressure in the lower canopy, but increased heterogeneity in browsing pressure in the upper canopy. In addition, plant defenses neutralized the effects of risk, and foraging height on browsing pressure. Our results demonstrate how foraging experiments typically the basis for field studies on species coexistence can be extended to make inferences about consumer-resource dynamics in human-modified landscapes."

In this context, different-aged individuals are expected to respond differently to seasonal variations because nutritional requirements and predation risk can vary with age. We investigated adult and juvenile European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) habitat use in a Mediterranean ecosystem of central Spain, during spring, summer and winter. Relationships between adult and juvenile rabbit pellet abundances and 11 environmental variables related to food availability and refuge density were analysed by means of multiple regression, and evaluated using information theory to identify the set of models best supported by the data. Density of warren entrances was the more constant predictor of habitat use for juvenile rabbits in all the seasons. Herbaceous vegetation volume had a negative influence and was the strongest predictor for adult rabbit habitat use in spring and winter. In summer, green vegetation cover became the strongest positive habitat use predictor. These results suggest that adults prefer to forage in low volume swards ensuring a wide sensory range for the detection of approaching predators. However, the arrival of summer and its associated food depletion forces them to shift toward more open productive areas where green vegetation persists, but at the expense of higher predation risk. Seasonal variation induces minor changes in juvenile habitat use due to their strong dependence on warrens. Thus, our results show that rabbit habitat use is influenced by animal age and seasonal variations in resources. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."

We assessed whether leopards hunted in certain habitats disproportionately to their availability and we investigated the factors influencing selection of feeding habitats. We also compared the number of kills and relative success rates of observed hunts in different vegetation types with available prey biomass and the degree of cover within each habitat. Leopards preferred hunting in habitats where prey was easier to catch rather than where prey was more abundant. However, in contrast to expectations, the apparent 'catchability' of prey was not proportional to the amount of cover provided by each habitat type. Instead, the probability of a kill occurring was greater in areas with intermediate cover levels, and these habitat types were favoured by leopards for hunting. There was no significant difference in the success rates of observed hunts in different habitats, suggesting that reduced detectability of prey in denser vegetation was the principal factor governing the decreased occurrence of kills there. Kleptoparasitism was relatively uncommon at Phinda, and there was no significant difference in the number of kills lost to other predators, or the likelihood of a carcass being hoisted in different vegetation types. Our results suggest that leopards are not 'supergeneralists' as widely portrayed and, at least in their choice of hunting habitat, show a degree of specialization that is previously undocumented. We suggest this is likely to influence local population densities and resilience to threats, and we discuss the need for fine-scale understanding of the species' ecological requirements in planning for its conservation.

This study examined the behaviors of captive-reared whooping cranes (Grus americana) upon their release in Florida to determine if rearing treatments may affect the behavior of the birds and how these affect their chances of survival in the wild. Individually tagged birds were observed at the rearing facility, the U.S. Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland, from hatch to 20 weeks of age and at the release site in Central Florida for up to 6 weeks post release. The rearing treatments were parent reared (PR), hand reared (HR), and hand reared with exercise (ARE). Observations at the rearing facility are described in a previous paper. At the release site, each bird was observed for 5 min every morning (0700-1000 h) and late afternoon (1500-1800 h) during the 6-week study period. Our results indicated that most of the time, the n = 34 birds were foraging (46.03 +/- 1.48%), followed by nonvigilant (20.89 +/- 0.73%), vigilant (19.21 +/- 0.72%), or performing comfort behaviors (11.61 +/- 1.28%). Data were analyzed using mixed models repeated measures ANOVA. There were no significant behavioral differences between HR and HRE birds. PR birds were found in larger groups than HR birds during the first 2 weeks post release and greater than HR and HRE birds afterwards. This may be interpreted as an antipredator strategy,for birds that relied on parental guidance during rearing. HR and HRE birds foraged more than PR birds during the first 2 weeks post release and PR birds were more vigilant during the first 2 weeks post release. Across rearing treatments, the percentages of time spent foraging and engaged in vigilant behaviors during rearing were positively correlated with their behavior upon release. If any of these behaviors can be demonstrated to have relevance for the survival of the whooping cranes after release then it may be possible to establish behavioral interventions to increase the frequencies of such behavior, so that they are perpetuated after release.

We provided equal feeding opportunities for bark-foraging bird species across seasons, cleared and uncleared woody understories, edge-to-interior habitat and tree diameters in a deciduous oak forest in north-eastern Illinois, USA, to determine habitat preferences of these bird species. We determined habitat preferences by quantifying patch-use intensity.2. Patch-use intensity was greater in the breeding season than in the non-breeding season, and in interior than in edge habitat. In addition, however, we found interactions among the habitat variables. For instance, these bird species showed significant preferences for foraging in woodland interior habitat and on large diameter trees in the breeding season, but not in the non-breeding season.3. Foraging preferences were further affected by understorey clearing, with preference for interior over edge habitat reversed in the cleared habitat in the non-breeding season. This effect may reflect unintended consequences of topography, an uncontrolled factor outside the experiment protocol.4. Overall, the results suggest that patch-use results from the response of the bird species to effects of vegetation variation from edge to interior habitat on both microclimate and predation risk. Those effects of vegetation may disappear or diminish when understorey vegetation is removed or reduced."

Grouping is known to reduce an individual's time investment in costly antipredator behaviours. Whether grouping might similarly provide a spatial release from antipredator behaviour and allow individuals to use risky habitat more and, thus, improve their access to resources is poorly known. We used mosquito larvae, Aedes aegypti, to test the hypothesis that grouping facilitates the use of high-risk habitat. We provided two habitats, one darker, low-risk and one lighter, high-risk, and measured the relative time spent in the latter by solitary larvae versus larvae in small groups. We tested larvae reared under different resource levels, and thus presumed to vary in body condition, because condition is known to influence risk taking. We also varied the degree of contrast in habitat structure. We predicted that individuals in groups should use high-risk habitat more than solitary individuals allowing for influences of body condition and contrast in habitat structure. Grouping strongly influenced the time spent in the high-risk habitat, but, contrary to our expectation, individuals in groups spent less time in the high-risk habitat than solitary individuals. Furthermore, solitary individuals considerably increased the proportion of time spent in the high-risk habitat over time, whereas individuals in groups did not. Both solitary individuals and those in groups showed a small increase over time in their use of riskier locations within each habitat. The differences between solitary individuals and those in groups held across all resource and contrast conditions. Grouping may, thus, carry a poorly understood cost of constraining habitat use. This cost may arise because movement traits important for maintaining group cohesion (a result of strong selection on grouping) can act to exaggerate an individual preference for low-risk habitat. Further research is needed to examine the interplay between grouping, individual movement and habitat use traits in environments heterogeneous in risk and resources.

This premise assumes that the receiver wombat is able to distinguish between faeces from different sources. To examine this theory, four types of faeces (male wombat, female wombat, dingo and a plastic control) were placed into the enclosures of 12 captive wombats. Behaviour, inter-individual distance and enclosure use were recorded during the period of placement, as well as the period before and the period after. When faeces were present, the wombats used concealed locations more often than other periods (mean%: pre-treatment: 71.3, treatment: 75.6, post-treatment: 72.7; P < 0.05). During the same period they also reduced grazing (mean min/period: pre-treatment: 15.8, treatment: 6.9, post-treatment: 13.1; P=0.0002) and walking activity (mean min/period: pre-treatment: 85.2, treatment: 66.9, post-treatment: 78.2; P = 0.01), indicating an increased perception of risk. Wombats approached the dingo faeces 5.6 times per treatment period, which was greater than for the control (3.0: P = 0.004) or female wombat faeces (3.7: P = 0.049). They also avoided other wombats most when male wombat faeces were present (8.3 retreats/period) compared to the control (4.5: P = 0.02). or female wombat (4.3; P = 0.01). There was a residual effect of increased wombat avoidance the period after presentation of dingo faeces (9.6; P <= 0.05). It is concluded that the southern hairy-nosed wombat can differentiate between faeces from different species and sex of conspecifics, and that predator faeces and those from male conspecifics increase wombat avoidance behaviour either during or after presentation.

The influences of sensory properties in the development of food preferences are well known. Attention as well may play a role in this process. Indeed, attention enhances information processing of emotionally salient objects or events by selecting them from the environmental context in which they are embedded. This study was aimed at investigating the relationship between acceptability of vegetables, food neophobia and taste responsiveness (measured as responsiveness to 6-n- propylthiouracil-PROP) and the attentive responses to vegetables that differ in sensory properties. 120 adults (20-24 years old, 74.2% women) were recruited and characterized for Food Neophobia and PROP responsiveness. To assess the interferences between emotional and attentional processes a food version of the Emotional Stroop Task was used. Attentional bias was measured through reaction times (RTs) to word stimuli, which included 16 vegetables characterized by generally appealing (e.g. 'sweetness', 'mildness') or unappealing (e.g. 'bitterness', 'astringency') sensory properties, and 16 emotionally neutral objects presented as control. A clear association between vegetable liking scores and sensory properties was found in this study, confirming the categorization of appealing and unappealing vegetables. Furthermore, results showed significantly higher RTs for vegetables than for neutral objects, demonstrating that vegetables were more emotionally salient than objects. Furthermore, the interference scores, computed as the differences between average RTs to unappealing/appealing vegetable words and average RTs to neutral words, for vegetables with unappealing sensory properties were higher than those for vegetables characterized by appealing sensory properties, indicating a greater attentional bias for unappealing vegetables. A strong inverse correlation between liking scores and RTs (r = -0.83) was found. No effect of food neophobia and PROP status was found on interferences scores, while PROP supertasters showed higher RTs for vegetables in general. The study showed that attention is particularly grabbed by vegetables with unappealing sensory properties, thus indicating that attention play a role in vegetable acceptability."

Installing restoration plantings is one method used to build habitat such as beach dunes where dunes have been lost, potentially creating habitat for dune-dependent species. We compared use of natural vegetated dunes, open sand gaps, and restoration plantings (habitat treatment) by Perdido Key beach mice (Peromyscus polionotus trissyllepsis) over 3years using tracking tubes to assess the value of restoration plantings for beach mice. Tubes were monitored in two seasons (early and mid-summer), and under new and full moon conditions. Mice used restoration plantings less than natural vegetated dunes but more than open sand gaps, which suggests restoration plantings may facilitate movement of mice across fragmented areas. Both season and moon phase influenced the effect of habitat treatment, interactions which may be attributable to perceived risk associated with movement under a combination of different conditions of ambient light, vegetation cover, and habitat novelty. Our results show restoration plantings provide habitat for movement and foraging, and may ameliorate some consequences of sea level rise and storms for beach mice and potentially other dune-dependent species into the future."

When the ground was completely snow-covered, bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus were die commonest prey, and the owls hunted more in forest than could be expected from random use. When snow-free ground appeared, the owls switched their prey and habitat; field voles Microtus agrestis and root voles M. oeconomus became the commonest prey, and clear-cuts and forest were used in proportion to availability. Snap-trapping showed that bank voles were commoner in forest than in clear-cuts, while field and root voles occurred almost only in clear-cuts. Snow-tracking showed that long small mammal trails (>1 m) were commonest in forest, short trails (<1 m) were equally common in the two habitat types, and ventilation holes were commonest in clear-cuts. Thus, prey animals occurring above the snow were probably more available to the owls in forest than in clear-cuts. When the snow melted, prey availability therefore increased in clear-cuts relative to that in forest. Thus, the owls seemed to select their microtine prey indirectly by selecting the habitat according to gain. Although the ratio of field and root voles to bank voles in the prey delivered to the nests increased as the ratio of clear-cut to forest increased among the habitats used by the hunting owls, field and root voles were consistently delivered more than could be expected from the owls' habitat use. The most likely reason is that these voles move slower than bank voles and are more easily taken by the owls once encountered."

Jays always initiated flock movement, and flickers followed. Flickers were more likely to forage when they accompanied jays than when they were alone. While jays searched under and around oaks for acorns and grasshoppers, flickers probed for subterranean ants. We found no evidence that flickers attempted to rob the jays' acorn caches, and we observed no agonistic encounters between the two species. Avian predators approached mixed flocks on six occasions, and in each case flickers responded to jay alarm calls by flying with the jays into oak foliage. All predation attempts were unsuccessful. We conclude that Northern Flickers most likely were associated with Mexican Jays in winter because of increased security from predation, and not because of shared resources."

The results showed that the species was clearly nocturnal but varied greatly in the number of daily activity bouts showing bimodal patterns in winter, trimodal patterns in spring and summer, even tetramodal patterns in autumn. It is possible that they are the most active in autumn and they reduce activity times per bout in winter to reduce energy loss arising from prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, as a survival strategy. Squirrels were observed for a total of 1680 h, they devoted 65.71% +/- 1.64 of time to resting. Feeding accounted for 16.82% +/- 0.64 of observation time. Other behaviors included self-grooming, watching, locomotion and so on. The percentages of nighttime spent in each of all behaviors varied greatly in some time period among different seasons, especially near early evening and midnight. This may be ascribed to variation in photoperiod."

Their effect on vegetation has been widely studied but less is known about the effects of such vegetation changes on other animals. We studied how changes in the vegetation caused by elephants influence the selection of microhabitats by five African herbivore species (giraffe, kudu, steenbok, impala, and zebra) in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. There was no clear significant effect of overall elephant-induced vegetation changes on microhabitat selection except for the small species (steenbok and impala) that used vegetation modified by elephants preferentially. This is consistent with a medium-term browsing facilitation hypothesis. More subtle possible effects were detected for larger browsers (giraffe and kudu). They selected areas with broken and uprooted plants and avoided coppiced areas. All of the browsers selected sites characterized by plants uprooted and broken by elephants, which were associated with a higher visibility, and ultimately a better probability of detecting an approaching predator, suggesting that perceived predation risk plays an important role in microhabitat selection. These results illustrate how elephants can initiate indirect effects that influence microhabitat selection by other herbivores. Understanding the indirect effects of elephants through changes in food availability and predation risk thus needs further investigation. The results of this study do not provide support for the hypothesis that elephant-induced changes in the structure of habitats have caused the declines in the populations of the other herbivores in the study area.

SCHISTOGYNUS),ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL,30,224,228,,2019,"Mixed-species flocks of birds represent an ecological phenomenon resulting from a diversity of complex interactions and evolutionary pressures. Tropical and temperate forests include many examples of passerine birds that interact by forming mixed-species flocks and by eavesdropping on the alarm calls produced by heterospecifics. In the mixed-flock systems of the Amazonia, species of antshrikes (Thamnomanes sp.) have been shown to provide other flock members valuable information regarding threats from predation through their frequent alarm calls. Several species of flock attendees respond to the alarms of antshrikes with predator-avoidance behaviors, but no study has yet shown a reciprocal relationship between flock members and flock-leading antshrikes. Apparently distinct from mixed-flock systems of other forests, there has been little evidence to support that flock-leading species of antshrikes benefit from the alarm signals of other flock members. Using alarm signals recorded during in situ exposures of mixed-flock species to trained raptors, we conducted a playback experiment on 16 different mixed flocks to see to what degree antshrikes may be eavesdropping on the alarms of Myrmotherula antwrens. Eight Dusky-throated Antshrikes (Thamnomanes ardesiacus) and eight Cinereous Antshrikes (T. schistogynus) were presented with i) conspecific alarms, ii) White-flanked Antwren (Myrmotherula axillaris) alarms, iii) Grey Antwren (M. menetriesii alarms), and iv) a control. The results of our experiment support that the alarms of the two species of antwrens elicit a significant response from both species of antshrikes. Our model also shows that the responses of antshrikes to antwrens' alarms are indistinguishable from their response to conspecific alarms, yet different from a control (Marginal R-2 = 0.36, Conditional R-2 = 0.37). This suggests that highly social flock-leading species such as Thamnomanes antshrikes may benefit from the information provided by flock mates regarding predators. Furthermore, these patterns are consistent with eavesdropping interactions observed within mixed-flocks in ecologically similar but geographically distant forests."

To address the influence of roadside habitat on the federally threatened Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), we compared foraging effort, the amount of food collected, and estimated energy intake in three habitat types: (1) edges along a paved road (roadside), (2) edges created by human-maintained habitat without a road (pasture), and (3) natural scrub-dominated areas with minimal human-maintained edges (interior). We used focal watches of male breeders during three stages of the breeding season (incubation, nestling, and fledged young) in two consecutive years to assess variation in food availability and energetic intake among the three habitat types. Florida Scrub-Jays in roadside habitats handled (consumed, cached, or fed to their mate or offspring) significantly more food items and spent less time foraging during the nestling stage than interior and pasture jays, but no differences in handled food were found among the three habitat types during the incubation and fledgling stages. Although they spent less time foraging, roadside jays had higher rates of energy intake than interior and pasture jays during the incubation stage. There were no differences in these measures of foraging during the incubation, nestling, and fledgling stages between interior and pasture jays. Our results suggest that roads or roadside habitat, not simply edge habitats, have a positive effect on food availability and energy intake in Florida Scrub-Jays, although the patterns differ across breeding stages.

Relatively suitable aquifers have been formed in complex formations in northwest Shahrood due to the presence of carbonate rocks as well as erosion and tectonic forces in the region. This study aims to identify and separate the calcareous formations that can form karst aquifers in the study area. As a result of erosion and tectonic forces, the rocks of the region exhibit spectral fluctuations, making it difficult for mapping geological formations using multispectral images. Therefore, Landsat 8 satellite-based images were processed by adopting the minimum noise fraction (MNF), independent component analysis (ICA), and band ratio (BR). The indices of calcareous formations and shale formations were created by the BR through the spectral behavior of pure pixels. Moreover, the support vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood (ML) were employed for classification. The SVM classifier proved more capable of classification than the ML classifier, and the transform ICA outperformed the MNF in the separation of formations. The lithological maps were extracted using the SVM with an overall accuracy (OA) of 68.04%. Furthermore, a method decision tree (DT) was employed to improve the classification accuracy. The DT classifier was then utilized to reclassify lithological maps that were classified by SVM and ML through morphological characteristics and indices of formations The DT classifier improved the lithological map accuracy by 10%. The boundaries of calcareous formations were extracted from non-calcareous formations with an accuracy of 93%, and the regional constructions were separated with an accuracy of similar to 80%. Finally, the lithological map was developed with a kappa of 0.734 and an OA of 78.59%. (C) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)"

We aimed to describe travel-related health problems in business travelers.Methods: GeoSentinel Surveillance Network consists of 64 travel and tropical medicine clinics in 29 countries; descriptive analysis was performed on ill business travelers, defined as persons traveling for work, evaluated after international travel 1 January 1997 through 31 December 2014.Results: Among 12 203 business travelers seen 1997-2014 (14 045 eligible diagnoses), the majority (97%) were adults aged 20-64 years; most (74%) reported from Western Europe or North America; two-thirds were male. Most (86%) were outpatients. Fewer than half (45%) reported a pre-travel healthcare encounter. Frequent regions of exposure were sub-Saharan Africa (37%), Southeast Asia (15%) and South Central Asia (14%). The most frequent diagnoses were malaria (9%), acute unspecified diarrhea (8%), viral syndrome (6%), acute bacterial diarrhea (5%) and chronic diarrhea (4%). Species was reported for 973 (90%) of 1079 patients with malaria, predominantly Plasmodium falciparum acquired in sub-Saharan Africa. Of 584 (54%) with malaria chemoprophylaxis information, 92% took none or incomplete courses. Thirteen deaths were reported, over half of which were due to malaria; others succumbed to pneumonia, typhoid fever, rabies, melioidosis and pyogenic abscess.Conclusions: Diarrheal illness was a major cause of morbidity. Malaria contributed substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly among business travelers to sub-Saharan Africa. Underuse or non-use of chemoprophylaxis contributed to malaria cases. Deaths in business travelers could be reduced by improving adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis and targeted vaccination for vaccine-preventable diseases. Pre-travel advice is indicated for business travelers and is currently under-utilized and needs improvement."

However, very little studies exist about their population and ecology in the country. The present study, therefore, investigated habitat analysis and population status of three falcon species; red-headed merlin Falco chicquera, common kestrel Falco tinnunculus and saker falcon Falco cherrug, in district, Chakwal Pakistan. Eight potential sampling sites were selected through surveillance surveys. Line transects were established in the selected sites for data collection and monthly visited from May 2009 to June 2010. For habitat analysis, data were recorded about trees using Point-centered quarter method, while shrubs and herbs were estimated using quadrate method and analyzed in terms of density and frequency of trees, shrubs and herbs, and Importance Value Index (IVI) for tree species. Red-headed merlin was found in five sites with average population of 0.238 +/- 0.06 birds /km(2), common kestrel in five sites with mean density of 0.246 +/- 0.05 birds /km(2), whereas saker falcon in only two sites having average density of 0.245 +/- 0.06 birds /km(2).

The highest grooming rates occurred when most winter ticks, Dermacentor albipictus, were blood-feeding. Elk at Elk Island National Park (EINP) and Jasper National Park (JNP) oral-groomed most during October-November, when larval ticks were engorging, with a secondary peak of grooming occurring during February-March-April, when nymphal and adult ticks were engorging. Elk at JNP supported 3 times the density of ticks and groomed 2-4 times more frequently than elk at EINP. Extensive grooming resulted in hair loss on JNP elk, with highest prevalence of hair loss in months with high grooming rates. These results support the prediction of the tick-challenge principle that hosts will groom more frequently when the threat of tick infestation is greater. At JNP, calves 1-6 weeks old groomed at 6-10 times the rate of cows, supporting the prediction of the body-size principle that smaller animals will groom more than larger animals. These patterns of grooming in elk may reflect an intrinsic grooming clock selected to optimize the tick-removal benefits of grooming in accordance with the constraints imposed by the Canadian winter."

Yet, how male and female deer in the urban environment associate, behave socially, and the evolutionary implications of that behavior remains unstudied. We examined predictions of the predation risk and the social factor hypotheses to explain intersexual grouping patterns and social behavior observed in white-tailed deer inhabiting the small city of San Marcos (population size similar to 45 000) in central Texas. Two routes were surveyed weekly from a vehicle at dawn and dusk for 1 year. Group size, composition, distance to vehicle, and alarm state of deer to the vehicle were recorded. Focal animal sampling was used to measure the time males and females spent and number of aggressions within one body length of each other when in groups. Female-only groups were most prevalent year round followed by mixed-sex groups, which increased in prevalence in summer and during the mating season. Alarm state was weakly related to group size but not to group composition. Males were farther apart and more aggressive than females in groups. Proportion of males in mixed-sex groups declined with increased group size. Intersexual patterns of grouping and social behavior of urban deer supported the social factor hypothesis but not the predation risk hypothesis."

In Eurasian woodcocks, Scolopax rusticola, habitat use may reflect this trade-off because meadows, where most birds spend the night, are characterized by a higher risk of predation and a higher biomass of food (earthworms) than the woods, used by day. We monitored activity of 34 woodcocks fitted with tiltswitch radiotags Young birds were more active than adults, probably because they were less efficient at foraging. In general, nocturnal activity was inversely correlated with air temperature and with daylight foraging activity, suggesting some compensatory mechanism, modulated by thermoregulatory constraints. Individual activity patterns differed, and we classified woodcocks according to three main wintering strategies: 'always', 'sometimes' or 'never' visiting fields at night. The decision to fly to fields at night seemed to be taken every evening according to the amount of daylight foraging activity in woods and the air temperature. After feeding in a rich patch of food on a mild day, woodcocks did not have to risk going to meadows. Conversely, in patches of fewer food resources or at lower temperatures or both, woodcocks could not meet all their energy requirements without going to fields at night (where there was always sufficient food) and eventually, changing their diurnal sites. Therefore, the trade-off between feeding and predation risk depends on how efficiently birds find a rich patch of food in the forest and exploit it optimally during the day.

The relationship between available biomass and short-term rate of intake (functional response) of herbivores is expected to provide a link between their food supply, and their distribution.2. The functional response of captive wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) on artificially produced broad-leaved (Lolium perenne L.) and narrow-leaved (Festuca ovina L.) grass swards was quantified.3. The general prediction that habitat selection varied with biomass, and reflected the potential rate of intake defined by the functional response, was also tested. The main alternative predictions, that both intake rate and habitat selection increased asymptotically with biomass, or were biased towards intermediate habitat standing crop biomasses, were distinguished.4. There was no relationship between biomass and short-term rate of intake on the narrow-leaved Festuca swards, but on the broad-leaved Lolium sward the short-term rate of intake increased asymptotically with biomass.5. In a field experiment on Lolium swards, a population of free-living wild rabbits selected the shortest swards with the lowest biomasses, and which provided the lowest potential rates of intake.6. Results demonstrate that free-living wild rabbits do not select habitats that provide the maximum potential rate of intake, nor did they select foraging habitat with intermediate standing crops. It is suggested that their selection of foraging areas in these grasslands which typify rabbit foraging habitat, is dominated by antipredator considerations rather than purely by rate of intake."

We observed behavior of free-living birds, in particular greenfinches (Carduelis chloris), blue tits (Parus caeruleus) and great tits (P. major), feeding on peanuts contained in wire-mesh feeders set out in 5 rows at 5-m intervals progressing away from the edge of woodland. Two identical patches of peanuts were available and were approximately 300 m apart. Prior to treatment, all birds preferred to feed closest to the woodland. We applied cinnamamide (0.6% mass/mass), an avian repellent, to peanuts in the preferred rows of 1 patch (row 1 nest to the wood iri the first veer of the experiment, and rows 1-3 in the second year). All birds avoided treated peanuts. When row I was treated, the number of tits feeding on rows 2-3 increased, and many of the green finches moved away from the treated patch to the untreated patch. Whem rows 1-3 were treated, a few tits moved Lo feed on row 1, but most birds left the treated patch and numbers increased on the untreated patch, which suggested they flew to the untreated patch. Modifications of feeding behavior brought about by the presence of cinnamamide varied among species. Such modifications may have been related to differences in social organization: tits were relatively solitary feeders and were also probably establishing territories at the time of the experiment (Feb-Mar), whereas greenfinches fed and flew in large flocks. Thus, it wits likely easier for greenfinches to fly between patches than the tits. Only when eating untreated peanuts at their local patch involved feeding greater than or equal to 20 m from cover did most tits leave the patch. probably for the untreated patch. Bird pests tend to be flock feeders, thus an effective and appropriately formulated chemical repellent may be an effective tool for modifying the behavior of bird pests in order to reduce damage."

Wildlife managers have attempted to capitalize on this innate behavior by using visual barriers, with varying degrees of success, to induce black-tailed prairie dogs (C. ludovicianus) to emigrate from or abandon a colony or preclude them from colonizing a valued area. We examined the behavior and movements of adult female black-tailed prairie dogs in response to both a visual barrier (SB Tensar((R)) snowfence, Tensar Polytechnologies, Morrow, Georgia) that had a see-through visibility of 60% and no visual barrier on 4 6- to 15-ha colonies in central Nebraska, USA. We applied visual barriers to the centerline of 2 colonies after depopulation of half of each colony. Prairie dogs did not respond to the visual barriers as expected. They did not consistently increase the frequency of vigilant or aggressive behavior, the size of use-areas, or the distance of their use-areas from the visual barriers. The number of prairie dogs within 50 m of visual barrier fences did not decline over a 2-month period. Surprisingly, frequency of foraging behavior increased for prairie dogs in the vicinity of a visual barrier.

We compared the frequency and duration of visits and the feeding efficiency of a mixed-species wintering bird flock among feeders set up at three heights within woods, at the edge between woods and dense shrub, and in open fields to investigate the feeding height preference of birds and its relationship to the extent of openness of the sites. Carolina chickadees (Parus carolinensis Audubon, 1834) and tufted titmice (Parus bicolor L., 1766) accounted for 96% of the total number of visits to feeders and 95.9% of the total time spent on feeders. Birds tended to visit higher feeders and feeders in the woods and at edge sites more frequently than they visited lower feeders and feeders in open fields. Birds also spent more time on higher feeders and feeders in the woods and at edge sites than on lower feeders and feeders in open fields. However, the feeding height preference changed over the course of observations, and different patterns were observed at different sites. In the woods and at the edge, bird visits shifted to the lower feeders earlier; in contrast, birds preferred higher feeders throughout the period of observation in open fields. Feeding efficiency was lower at open sites than in woods and at edge sites, but birds spent the least time per seed on low feeders at open sites. Seeds on higher feeders and in woods or at edge sites were removed faster. Regardless of the height and locality of feeders, birds preferred energy-rich oil-type seeds over energy-poor striped seeds."

Such prolonged parental care could lead to postponed dispersal of the offspring and thereby facilitate the formation of kin groups. We tested whether alpha birds in Siberian jays protected their independent, retained offspring by giving alarm calls during simulated predator attacks. We compared the responses to predator attacks simulated by flying a hawk model over a dyad of birds on a feeder for dyads composed of an alpha bird and either a relative or a nonrelative. Alpha females were nepotistic in their alarm-calling behaviour, in that they called more frequently when accompanied by their retained offspring than by unrelated immigrants, but alpha males called indiscriminately. This difference in alarm calling could reflect dominance relationships in Siberian jay groups, because the presence of immigrants may be less costly to alpha males, but alpha females are more vulnerable to competition from immigrants. Alarm calls were usually given during escape, when both individuals in the dyad had left the feeding site. However, results of a playback experiment suggest that alarm calls conveyed information about danger and incited an immediate escape reaction. Our results indicate that alarm calling can be nepotistic, and that factors other than kinship influence alarm-calling behaviour. Nepotistic antipredator behaviours are benefits that offspring can gain only in their natal territory. Hence, in the absence of preferential treatment by their parents, offspring may be more likely to disperse and kin groups are prevented from forming.

We modeled the relative influences of nest age, temporal variation in nest success and habitat-related covariates at two spatial scales (nest-site and patch scale) on daily nest survival during incubation for eastern wild turkeys Meleagris gallopavo silvestris in a mixed-use landscape. Daily survival rate of turkey nests during incubation increased as percent understory cover (vegetation < 1 m tall) increased and decreased with increasing density of woody shrubs and saplings and herbaceous stems < 1 m tall (understory vegetation density) around the nest. We suggest that nest survival may be dependent on a balance of sufficient understory cover around nests to provide concealment for hens and nests, but with understory vegetation density below levels that reduce the hen's ability to detect a predator or to escape after detecting a potential threat. The balance between sufficient understory cover and limited density of understory vegetation occurred where understory (< 1 m tall) cover exceeded 50% and understory vegetation density was < 25 stems/m(2). Models that included variables related to the patch scale (e.g. fragmentation, edge and dominant land-cover class in a patch) did not receive strong support, demonstrating the relative importance of finer scale nest-site variables over patch-scale variables in determining survival of wild turkey nests in our highly variable mixed-use landscape."

In the latter case, prey respond to perceived predation risk through proactive or reactive risk management strategies occurring at different spatial and temporal scales. The predator-prey space race and landscape of fear concepts are useful to better understand how predation risk affects prey behavioral decisions and distribution. We assessed predation risk effects in a terrestrial Arctic community, where the arctic fox is the main predator of ground-nesting birds. Using high-frequency GPS data, we estimated a predator activity landscape corresponding to fox space use patterns and validated with an artificial prey experiment that this predator activity landscape correlated with the predation risk landscape. We then investigated the effects of the fox activity landscape on multiple prey species, by assessing the anti-predator behavior of a main prey (snow goose) actively searched for by foxes, and the nest distribution of several incidental prey species. We first found that snow geese showed a stronger level of nest defense in areas highly used by foxes, possibly responding with a reactive strategy to variation in predation risk. Then, nests of incidental prey reproducing in habitats easily accessed by foxes had a lower probability of occurrence in areas highly used by foxes, suggesting these birds may use a proactive risk management strategy by shifting their distribution away from risky areas. For incidental prey species nesting in microhabitat refuges difficult to access by foxes, probability of nest occurrence was independent of predation risk in the surrounding area, as they avoid risk at a finer spatial scale. By tracking all individuals of the dominant predator species in our study area, we demonstrated the value of using predator space use patterns to infer spatial variation in predation risk. Overall, we highlight the diversity of risk management strategies in prey sharing a common predator, hence refining our understanding of the mechanisms driving species distribution and community structure."

When the early development of such traits conflicts with predator protection, we expect that male calves will exhibit risk-taking behavior, Such as high activity level and increasing distance from mother, to a greater extent than female calves. We investigated sex differences in mother-calf distance, calf activity levels, and calf mortality in a semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) population. The results show that male calves stray farther away from their mothers, exhibit a higher level of locomotive behavior in terms of play and walking, and are more vulnerable to predation than are female calves. Although mother-calf distance increased over time in 1- to 6-month-old calves, no evidence was apparent for an increase in sex difference in mother-calf distance over this period. The results suggest a trade-off between predation vulnerability and investments in behavioral traits thought to be important for future reproductive success and Suggest that these sex-related differences in behavior are apparent as early as 6 months of age."

While fairly extensive knowledge exists for the direct effects of wolf predation threat (e.g., cattle death and injury losses, elevated stress), our understanding of wolf-caused changes in cattle behavior and the associated cascade of potential indirect effects on cattle resource selection, diet quality, activity budgets, and energetic relationships is still largely in its infancy. We investigated whether wolf presence affected the daily travel distance of Global Positioning System(GPS)-collared cattle under a replicated, Impact-Control study conducted inwestern Idaho and northeasternOregon during 2008-2012. Cattle in three Control (Oregon) study areas, where wolf presence was consistently low, traveled farther per day (13.7 +/- 0.396 SE km day(-1)) than those in three Impact (Idaho) study areas (11.4 +/- 0.396 SE km day(-1)) with moderate to high wolf presence. At Control study areas, cattle traveled farthest per day in July (13.2 +/- 0.355 SE km day(-1)) and were least mobile in October (11.8 +/- 0.365 SE km day(-1)), but daily travel distances were similar across all months for cattle in Impact study areas. This observational study provides evidence suggesting cattle in mountainous grazing areas alter their spatial behavior in response to gray wolf presence. These behavioral changes have energetic consequences that could potentially impact cattle productivity and ranch economics.

The overwintering Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis) feeds on crop remains in farmlands; thus, reasonable conservation management of this type of farmland that surrounds wetlands is critical for the overwintering populations of the Black-necked Crane; however, it is not clear how the Black-necked Crane chooses the foraging land in the farmland. Methods A thorough field positioning survey of all foraging sites in farmland areas around the Caohai Wetland and a sampling analysis of habitat selection by the Black-necked Crane were conducted during the winters from 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. Results Multiple factors contributed to the selection of foraging habitat in farmlands, i.e., food factors (crop remains and tillage methods) > human disturbance factors (distance to road and settlement) > topography factors (slope aspect), listed according to the strength of influence. Additionally, Black-necked Cranes tend to choose farmland sites where there was no machine tillage, the crop remains were > 500 g/m(2), the distance to residences ranged from 100 to 500 m, the distance to roads ranged from 50 to 100 m, and the slopes exhibited western or eastern aspects. As the winters progressed, the volume of the edible crop remains declined, and the influences of the other main factors also changed, i.e., the factors of human disturbance (distance to road and settlement) became less important, while the effect of the food factor (crop remains) was strengthened. Thus, the foraging sites near the road became more important. Conclusion The farming area surrounding the Caohai Wetland is very important for the overwintering Black-necked Crane. Food factors and human disturbance factors are the main factors that influence the choice of feeding ground."

Population dynamics and selection pressures will depend on the identity of dominant predators in the system, and these may vary substantially among habitats. Arthropods emerge as chief predators on caterpillars in the understorey of non-montane tropical forest, whereas birds dominate elsewhere. In a tropical forest in Uganda, Africa, we evaluated marks on dummy caterpillars that differed in size, material (clay vs. dough), colourant, and plant species on which dummy caterpillars were exposed. We included live caterpillars to estimate the extent to which studies using artificial caterpillars reflect actual levels of predation. Ants and wasps were the most important damagers of dummy caterpillars, whereas bug and beetle damage was very rare, and no bird or small mammal damage was observed. Daily attack rates did not differ significantly from apparent mortality of live caterpillars (daily mortality = 12.1%), but dummy caterpillars made from dough were attacked more frequently (daily attack rate = 18.4%) than those from clay (daily attack rate = 6.9%). Caterpillars of different colour and size, and caterpillars exposed on different plant species had the same chances to be predated. This is in contrast to results from temperate area studies where birds dominate and are not affected by dummy caterpillar material, but prefer larger caterpillars. Our results are consistent with dominant predators on tropical forest caterpillars being invertebrates that are more chemically than visually oriented, so that: (1) material used for dummy caterpillars is important, (2) background matching is relatively unimportant, and (3) being large may have less of a cost. These patterns in predation might facilitate polyphagy and evolution of large body size in tropical Lepidoptera."
"Arellano, Blanca; Roca, Josep",Urban landscapes and night time Urban Heat Island,REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS V,11535,,,10.1117/12.2573599,2020,"The study of urban heat islands (UHI) is of great importance in the context of climate change (CC) and global warming. Cities accumulate heat in urban land covers as well as in built infrastructures, representing true islands of heat in relation to their rural (less artificialized) environment. The densest urban spaces as well as the industrial and commercial areas are characterized by accumulating more heat during the day. On the other hand, the areas of lower density, the Urban Sprawl, tend to have a better climatic behaviour. The lower density as well as the greater amount of vegetation in the Urban Sprawl areas reduce the UHI during daylight hours.Nevertheless, the literature on urban climate has highlighted the singular importance of the nighttime UHI. It is during the night that the effects of UHI become more apparent, due to the low cooling capacity of urban construction materials and is during nighttime that temperatures can cause higher health risks, leading to the aggravation of negative impacts on people's health and comfort in extreme events such as heat waves becoming more and more frequent and lasting longer. However, the study of nocturnal UHIs is still poorly developed, due to the structural problems regarding the availability of land surface and air temperature data for night time.This paper aims to develop a model for nocturnal UHI using data from Landsat thermal bands (with spatial resolution of 30 square meters per pixel) and contrasting Landsat's very limited nighttime images with daytime ones. The contrast allows the construction of cooling models of the LST based on geographical (longitude, latitude, distance to the sea, DTM, slope, orientation, etc.) and land covers characteristics (density, vegetation and building indexes, impervious surface, and others parameters). Said models will allow evaluating the nighttime LST of the different urban landscapes: historical centers, ensanches, discontinuous urban fabrics (of different densities), scattered building areas and industrial and commercial areas, trying to clarify the nightly UHI of Urban Sprawl. The case study is the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (636 km2, 3 3 million inhabitants)."

The study was conducted over one year in three different areas (urban, rural and pasture). We made monthly observations of the foraging strategies used by the species and the habitats they selected. Possible variations in availability of resources over the twelve months of the study did not influence the type of foraging used by the three species. Significant differences between the foraging strategies used by the species were observed in relation to the foraging site, specifically the foraging substrate. Soil, grass and paving were the foraging substrates that were most used by all three species, indicating that they are ground-foraging birds. Differences in the time spent in the foraging areas were significant between species; Z. auriculata remained in the foraging area for the longest time, often foraging in a group, suggesting a possible adaptation of this species in order to obtain a greater amount of resources. Adapting to anthropological environments without continuous forest cover could be one of factors that the most influential in the selection of habitat by the three species of Columbidae. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed differences between the proportions of herbaceous and gramineae plants, paving, plantations and shrubs in the habitats selected by each species. We also concluded that differences in the time spent in the foraging areas and between foraging substrates are factors contributing to the ecological separation of the three species and therefore allowing their coexistence in the region."

We tested the hypothesis that group size and level of risk interact to affect the levels of antipredatory behaviour in the group-living sun skink, Lampropholis delicata. We controlled the size of lizard groups (N = 1, 2, 4, 8 or 12 females) and altered predation risk by providing either a basking tile covered with chemical cues from a predator (high risk) or one without scent (low risk). The time allocated to individual antipredatory behaviour decreased significantly with increasing group size. The relation between group size and time allocated to individual antipredatory behaviour was nonlinear and asymptotic, and did not change under low and high risks of predation. However, group size and predation risk interacted to affect significantly the time that lizards allocated to antipredatory behaviour. When the overall risk from predators was high, individual responsiveness decreased strongly as group size became larger. In contrast, when the overall risk from predators was low, individual responsiveness decreased weakly as group size became larger. Consequently, the time that lizards allocated to antipredatory behaviour under different risks of predation converged as group size increased.

We compared aspen growth patterns in an area burned by the 1988 fires to aspen growth patterns in an adjacent unburned area. Elk (Cervus elaphus L.) are the principal ungulates that use this area to meet foraging needs. Within a 2 m x 6 m belt transect established in each aspen thicket, we measured aspen densities and recorded annual browsing and height information on the three tallest post-1988 aspen stems. We found greater densities (p < 0.01) in the burned area relative to the unburned area. A decline in the percentage of stems browsed in the burned area began in 1997, with no measured browsing occurring since 2001. In contrast, the percentage of stems browsed in the unburned area began declining in 2002, with 41% of stems still being browsed in 2004. We hypothesize that the combined effect of fire and a subsequent decrease in herbivory following wolf reintroduction facilitated aspen growth. We further propose that, in addition to any changes in elk density in recent years, a recoupling of fire with increased predation risk from wolves may create a positive feedback loop that improves aspen recruitment.

While many species are limited to seeking safety under cover or under ground, some birds can fly away from their predators and escape to trees. If birds in fact 'feel' safer (e.g. perceive less risk) in trees, we would expect them to tolerate closer approach by a potential terrestrial predator. Another component of safety is at which point the animal detects an approaching threat, which we expected to increase with eye size, assuming eye size is a surrogate for visual acuity. We used the distance birds moved away from an approaching human [flight initiation distance (FID)] as a metric to determine whether birds associated a lower risk of predation by being in trees, and we used the distance at which birds first displayed alert behaviors from an approaching human (alert distance) to determine if birds with larger eyes had higher detection distances. Although some species were affected by tree height, we found no clear pattern that birds assessed themselves to be at a lower risk of predation when they were greater than or equal to3 m above the ground compared with being <3 m above ground. In the 10 species for which height had any significant effect on FID, birds greater than or equal to3 m off the ground had greater FIDs in six species, but the remaining three species had the opposite response. While we found a significant positive relationship between eye size and alert distance in 23 species, the relationship was not present in a phylogenetic analysis using independent contrasts, which suggests that the apparent relationship was influenced strongly by the association between the studied species. Together, these results suggest that birds do not obviously associate being in a tree with safety, and that variations in visual acuity, per se, cannot be used as a general indicator of differences in alert distances, as previously suggested in the literature."

Why broiler chickens stay near walls and how density affects this,APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,124,97,103,10.1016/j.applanim.2010.02.007,2010,"Broiler chickens are reported to be close to walls at higher densities. The reason for this is not clear, since evolutionary theories would suggest that birds should attempt to be in the middle of the flock.We studied the spatial distribution (during weeks 4-6) of broiler chickens stocked at 2.4, 5.8, 8.8, 12.1, 13.6, 15.5. 18.5 and 21.8 birds/m(2) (in 3.3 m(2) pens), to investigate the underlying reasons for the pattern of spatial distribution. Three possible reasons were considered: seeking cover from predators in the centre of the flock, seeking cover from predators near walls, and avoidance of disturbances by conspecifics. Spatial distribution was analysed by comparing the number of birds in four separate parts of the pen (inner, inner middle, outer middle and outer). Apart from effects on spatial distribution, birds were predicted to have their behaviour disturbed more often by other birds in the flock as the overall density in the pen increased, leading to shortened bouts of behaviour and an increase in adjustments of the sitting or lying posture.We found that higher treatment density led to shorter sitting and preening bouts (P=0.024 and P=0.013), and a sharper decrease in walking bout length as weeks progressed (density x week, P=0.025). In addition, birds adjusted their sitting or lying posture more often at higher densities (P<0.001). indicating an increased number of disturbances.Preference for the wall area occurred when overall density in the pen peaked (in the last week of rearing, at treatment densities above 12.1 birds/m(2)). On the other hand, more animals were present in the centre of the pen than at the edges at some of the densities in weeks 4 and 5. Because of its occurrence at peak density, avoidance of disturbance seems the most likely explanation for wall preference. Thus, increased use of the wall area may be an indicator that birds are experiencing crowding. (C) 2010 Elsevier By. All rights reserved."

Cover can be both obstructive, reducing the visibility of the surroundings and hindering escape, and protective, providing refuge. We investigated how the provision of cover (long grass) affected (1) the escape behaviour and (2) the alarm call behaviour of Common Starlings Sturnus vulgaris responding to a model hawk during a simulated attack. Starlings always retreated away from the predator and sometimes alarm-called. Their escape trajectory was close to the ground when escaping in long grass, which could be explained by either tall swards hindering take-off or such swards being used as protective cover. On short grass their escape trajectory was much steeper (> 45 degrees). We also investigated the use of alarm calls in Starlings according to predictions arising from the costs and benefits to callers and receivers. Callers could benefit from using alarm calls through dilution or confusion if their use initiates flock departures, thus reducing their probability of being targeted. If there is no cost to the producer of alarm calls we predicted that detectors should call at all times to gain these benefits (i.e. irrespective of grass length), but if their use is costly we predicted that they would be used only when the benefits outstrip the costs. In this case we would predict that alarm calls would be given when other (visual) signals were impaired on long grass but not when they were effective on short grass. Starlings used alarm calls on long grass when visibility was reduced more frequently than on short grass, suggesting that calling has a cost to the producer. The contrasting escape strategies of Starlings in relation to a relatively small (10 cm) change in grass height demonstrates the potential importance of habitat structure in determining predation risk."

Smoke from large wildfires can travel long distances and have a harmful effect on human health, the environment, and climate in other areas. More recently, in 2018-2019 there have been many large fires. This study focused on the wildfires that occurred in the United States of America (USA), Brazil, and Australia using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) and a TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Specifically, we analyzed the spatial-temporal distribution of black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) and the vertical distribution of smoke. Based on the results, the highest detection of smoke (similar to 14 km) was observed in Brazil; meanwhile, Australia showed the largest BC column burden of similar to 1.5 mg/m(2). The meteorological conditions were similar for all sites during the fires. Moderate temperatures (between 32 and 42 degrees C) and relative humidity (30-50%) were observed, which resulted in drier conditions favorable for the burning of fires. However, the number of active fires was different for each site, with Brazil having 13 times more active fires than the USA and five times more than the number of active fires in Australia. However, the high number of active fires did not translate to higher atmospheric constituent emissions. Overall, this work provides a better understanding of wildfire behavior and the role of meteorological conditions in emissions at various sites."

Identifying ways in which the invader are poorly suited to its new range might provide novel opportunities for biocontrol.The spread of cane toads (Bufo marinus, native to central and South America) through tropical Australia has created major ecological problems. Although many native predators cannot deal with the toxins of the invasive toads, 'meat ants' (Iridomyrmex reburrus) kill and consume many metamorph toads. Might this be a mismatch between the invader and its newly invaded range, whereby the morphology, locomotor ability and/or behaviour of cane toads renders them vulnerable to a predator that poses little danger to native anurans?To explore this possibility, we measured habitat use and activity patterns in meat ants, metamorph cane toads and metamorphs of seven native frog species (Litoria bicolor, L. caerulea, L. dahlii, L. nasuta, L. rothii, Limnodynastes convexiusculus, Opisthodon ornatus) in standardized enclosures in the laboratory.Unlike the frogs, (1) toads selected open microhabitats and were active diurnally, thus increasing encounter rates with meat ants; (2) toads failed to detect and evade approaching ants; (3) toads exhibited poor locomotor ability (short slow hops, reflecting their small size and short limbs); and (4) toads frequently relied on an ineffective defence mechanism (crypsis) when attacked.In combination, these traits rendered cane toad metamorphs far more susceptible to predation by meat ants than were any of the native frogs tested. That vulnerability presumably reflects lack of coevolution between cane toads and Australian ants.The inability of invasive toads to escape predatory native ants might be exploited to reduce cane toad numbers, by manipulating ant densities and/or locations during periods of toad metamorph emergence."

Testing the memory capacity of the animals after antipredator training is important to evaluate if the application of the training is worthwhile. A group of IS captive-born greater rheas was studied at Belo Horizonte Zoo. Eight birds were antipredator trained and seven birds were not. After the end of the antipredator training sessions, we run four memory tests at 40, 55, 70 and 88 days after training was completed. The memory tests consisted of showing a predator model to the rheas and recording their behavioural responses. It was measured the capacity of antipredator information storage, the influence of the group size on the behaviour of the birds and the influence of the antipredator training on the elicitation of the correct behavioural responses of the birds when confronted by a predator. The results showed that the rheas retained predator recognition for almost three months, that the group size affected the responses of the birds (more defence behaviours expressed when tested alone) and that the antipredator training is essential to elicit the adequate antipredatory responses, since untrained birds behaved in a tranquil manner when confronted by a predator model. We concluded that antipredator training is worthwhile for future reintroduction programs for greater rheas, since their memory capacity is considerable."
"Krause, J; Godin, JGJ",Influence of prey foraging posture on flight behavior and predation risk: Predators take advantage of unwary prey,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,7,264,271,10.1093/beheco/7.3.264,1996,"Foraging in animals is often associated with characteristic body postures, such as the head-down posture. When foraging conflicts with the ability to detect predators or to flee, individuals may incur a greater risk of mortality to predation than otherwise. Here we investigate the influence of different foraging postures (horizontal versus nose-down body posture) on the ability of individuals to respond to approaching predators and on the risk of mortality to predation in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Individuals engaged in nose-down foraging were assumed to be able to visually scan a smaller area for predators and to escape less effectively due to their body posture, and thus are more vulnerable to stalking predators than horizontally foraging ones. In a first experiment, we separately exposed nonforaging, horizontally foraging, and nose-down foraging guppies to an approaching cichlid fish predator model. Nonforaging guppies reacted sooner to and initiated flight further away from the approaching model than did foraging fish collectively and horizontally foraging individuals responded sooner to the model than nose-down foraging ones. Comparing all test guppies, nose-down foraging individuals were the most likely not to exhibit any response to the predator model. When presented with a simultaneous choice of two guppies behind a one-way mirror, individual blue acara cichlid (Aeguidens pulcher), a natural predator of the guppy, preferred to attack foraging guppies over nonforaging ones and nose-down foraging guppies over horizontally foraging individuals. In a final experiment with free-swimming cichlids and guppies, we demonstrated that individual risk of predation for guppies foraging nose down was greater than for guppies foraging horizontally, and both were at greater fisk than nonforaging guppies. This latter result is consistent with the above differences in the guppy's responsiveness to approaching predators depending on their foraging behavior, and with the finding that cichlid predators preferred fish that were less likely to show any response to them. Ou; results therefore indicate that the ability to respond to approaching predators and the risk of mortality to predation in the guppy is strongly influenced by their foraging activity, and in particular their foraging posture, and that cichlid predators preferentially select less wary and more vulnerable guppies."

A.",Seasonal and landscape effects on the biotic resistance of forest communities to experimental insect introductions,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,46,614,625,10.1111/een.13009,2021,"1. Natural enemies play an important role in the regulation of many forest insect populations. The hypothesis that these organisms also reduce invasion potential is one element of a concept known as biotic resistance. While many studies have shown that the abundances of natural enemies are affected by landscape structure and diversity, seasonality, and host tree species, this study tests the hypothesis that these factors affect the biotic resistance of forest communities to invasion by a non-native tussock moth.2. At 20 sites on Vancouver Island, Canada, spanning a range of natural to urban forests, small populations of the rusty tussock moth, Orgyia antiqua, an exotic polyphagous tussock moth, were introduced. Introductions were repeated at three different periods in the year, on coniferous and deciduous host trees, and included both late-instar larvae and pupae. The survival of these small populations was monitored in relation to four landscape variables measured around each site.3. Spring introductions had significantly lower mortality rates than either early or mid-summer introductions. There was little difference in predation rates between coniferous and deciduous host trees. The amount and type of forest cover in the landscape had important, but seasonally dependent, effects on survival that likely reflect changes in the habitat requirements of a shifting community of generalist predators.4. Based on the results, this study concludes that landscapes with intermediate forest cover are the least resistant to invasion by early feeding species such as the rusty tussock moth."
"Whittingham, Mark J.; Devereux, Claire L.",Changing grass height alters foraging site selection by wintering farmland birds,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,9,779,788,10.1016/j.baae.2007.08.002,2008,"Grassland is a valuable habitat for many farmland bird species, some of which have declined in Europe. Successful management of this habitat is important to benefit these species. Recent studies have suggested little correlation between food abundance and bird use in grasslands instead providing access to food may be crucial. We tested the importance of manipulating sward height (via mowing) on the distribution of wintering birds in agriculturally managed grass fields using two within-field experimental designs. In experiment 1, we investigated the effect of two treatments (mown once and control). In experiment 2. we investigated the effects of four treatments (mown once early. mown once late. mown early and late. and control).Mown plots supported higher abundances of foraging kestrels, thrushes mid starlings. In contrast meadow pipits and grey herons preferred unmown plots with longer grass. These differences are probably explained by differing anti-predation strategies, increased food abundance for species that prefer above-ground invertebrates (e.g. more food for rneadow pipits on longer swards) and increased food accessibility, on short grass swards (e.g. for starling, thrush spp.). There were limited effects of multiple mowing events on plot use suggesting one early winter mowing, treatment may suffice to create favourable conditions for species that prefer shorter swards.Providing grassland heterogeneity should benefit a range of wintering farmland birds. Although we use mowing to change grass sward height, our findings may also apply at other times of year when livestock grazing may be a more practical solution.

Compared with same-aged, free-living juveniles, captive juveniles (housed in large outdoor enclosures) are more likely to respond to playbacks, to exhibit more exaggerated initial responses (e.g. enter a burrow vs. freeze) and to remain alert longer following playbacks of alarm and non-alarm calls. Two studies were conducted to identify the factors contributing to these response differences. Postemergent rearing environments (such as the opaque enclosure walls that limited visual and auditory stimulation in captivity, or the increased number of conspecifics and natural alarm calls that free-living juveniles experienced) could not account for the majority of response differences between captive and free-living juveniles (Study 1). To determine if the attenuated responses of free-living juveniles were due to foraging pressures, we compared the behaviours of food-provisioned captive juveniles with those of non-provisioned captive juveniles. Although sample sizes were small, no differences were evident in the development or expression of responses as a function of foraging pressure. Next, the development of captive juveniles was compared with that of juveniles reared in the field but housed in captivity after emergence (Study 2). Differences in the response patterns of field-reared and captive-reared animals matched the differences reported previously, as the responses of field-reared animals observed in captivity mirrored those of free-living juveniles that remained in the field. Thus, the differences in alarm-call responses originally observed between captive and free-living juveniles are attributed to their pre-emergent, but not post-emergent, rearing histories.Captive pups experienced levels of auditory, visual, tactile, and olfactory stimulation that were greater than those typically experienced by free-living pups. The increased exposure to conspecific alarm calls may have primed captive pups to respond more often and more intensely to the auditory stimuli they heard as juveniles. Sensitivity to early rearing environments may be adaptive for young ground squirrels if it facilitates the development of antipredator behaviour patterns that are appropriate for the local predator environment (e.g. openness of habitat, frequency of predators, availability of refuges)."

The Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) at Lincoln Park Zoo, USA, participate in voluntary cognitive research sessions in two touchscreen testing booths adjacent to their home enclosure, which are in view of the public. As other anthropogenic influences, such as loud noise levels, have been shown to induce attention bias effects in zoo primates, we wanted to determine if visitors also created cognitive bias effects for these macaques. Therefore, we sought to evaluate if and how the macaques' testing participation and performance changed in response to the presence and number of visitors, and what any changes might mean for their welfare. Taking advantage of the zoo's closure in response to COVID19, we conducted 10 test sessions when the zoo was closed and 10 test sessions after reopening. Across all 20 test sessions, we recorded ambient sound levels (dB) and, when visitors were present, we also recorded visitor numbers and their location near the exhibit. Between when the zoo was closed and open, we did not find a difference in the macaques' participation rates (p = 0.45) or task accuracy (p = 0.62) in an identity match-tosample paradigm. However, we found the macaques' response latencies were significantly faster when the zoo re-opened (p < 0.001) and with visitors present, but that the macaques did not avoid the testing booth that was closer to visitors. Considering the number of visitors, we found that the macaques completed most of their trials when small crowds were present (1-20 visitors) - the most common crowd size we recorded - but the macaques' task accuracy did not differ across crowd size categories. Based on our findings, we found no clear evidence that these macaques were impacted by the return of zoo visitors and remain confident that such voluntary touchscreen opportunities can be an engaging aspect of animal lives in zoo settings."
"Wheatley, Rebecca; Niehaus, Amanda C.; Fisher, Diana O.; Wilson, Robbie S.",Ecological context and the probability of mistakes underlie speed choice,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,32,990,1000,10.1111/1365-2435.13036,2018,"Movement is fundamental to the ecology of animals, and an animal's choice of movement speed determines the duration, energetic costs, and probability of success of any given activity. It is often assumed that animals should use maximum speeds when escaping from predators, but an increasing number of studies find animals rarely move as fast as they can in nature because faster speeds come with a greater chance of mistakes. Mathematical modelling suggests that, when escaping predators, prey animals should optimise speeds to simultaneously outrun their pursuer and minimise their probability of slipping. This can be particularly important when running along narrow structures like branches. When foraging, however, animals should avoid moving at high speeds, which are often energetically costly and decrease the ability to detect food or predators.In this study, we examined how trade-offs between speed and probability of slipping influenced the speed choice of wild antechinus (Antechinus mysticus) during escaping and foraging behaviours. We also examined how this trade-off affected foraging behaviour.Antechinus ran significantly faster when escaping (1.2070.033m/s) than foraging (0.1450.002m/s), and slipped 37% more often during escapes. However, foraging antechinus still slipped frequently on narrow branches, despite running an order of magnitude more slowly than they did on wide branches. Furthermore, antechinus slipped at lower speeds when foraging than they did when escaping, suggesting that avoiding mistakes is less highly prioritized when foraging.Antechinus visited the feeding station accessed by a wide branch more frequently (and ate more while there) compared with feeding stations accessed by narrow branches, even when those branches were 33% or 67% shorter. This suggests that foraging decisions may be based on potential limitations to speed and the probability of slipping over distance to cover.Though activities such as running can be fundamental to animals' fitness, a general framework to understand how animals select speeds in nature is still being developed. We test the assumption that animals choose running speeds to minimise their motor mistakes, and demonstrate the cost of mistakes is likely to be different across ecological and behavioural contexts."

Using fine-scale spatial analyses, we examined how proximity to human settlements affects antipredator responses of ungulates. We studied seven common ungulate species (Kirk's dik-dik, Thomson's gazelle, impala, common warthog, common wildebeest, common zebra and Masai giraffe) in the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem in northern Tanzania. In zebra and giraffe, flight responses to humans were significantly more likely when closer to settlements; however, there was a weak relationship between flight responses and distance to settlement in all other species. While there was largely a weak relationship between proximity to human settlements, the distribution of settlements in the landscape appears to affect wildlife behaviour, suggesting that animals perceive and respond to spatial variation in risk exerted by humans.Resume Alors que les populations humaines croissent et entrent de plus en plus en contact avec la faune sauvage, il est important de bien comprendre comment les perturbations des hommes modifient le comportement de la faune.

"Moriarty, Katie M.; Epps, Clinton W.; Zielinski, William J.",Forest thinning changes movement patterns and habitat use by Pacific marten,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,80,621,633,10.1002/jwmg.1060,2016,"Simplifying stand structure to reduce fuel density is a high priority for forest managers; however, affects to Pacific marten (Martes caurina) movement and connectivity are unknown. We evaluated whether thinning forests to reduce fuels influenced movements of Pacific marten. We collected movement paths from 22 martens using global positioning system telemetry to evaluate habitat selection and describe movement patterns. We quantified motion variance, speed, and path sinuosity in 3 stand types that differed in structural complexity (i.e., complex [dense], simple [thinned], and open). We hypothesized marten movement would differ between stand types and predicted that 1) martens would select stand types with increased structural complexity (complex>simple>open); 2) movements would increase in complexity (sinuosity, motion variance) and decrease in speed when martens traveled through stands with increased structural complexity; 3) speeds would increase during summer, indicating increased movement during the breeding season; and 4) males would move more rapidly because of their larger home ranges. Martens traveled 0.5-27.2km/day and an average (SD) of 1.4 (0.4) km/hour. Martens selected home ranges with fewer openings compared to the study area overall. Within home ranges, martens strongly selected complex stands over simple stands and openings. Speed and movement complexity were most consistent over time and movements were more sinuous and slower in complex stand types compared with openings and simple stands. Movement was erratic and more linear in openings than in both complex and simple stands. In simple stands, movement patterns were intermediate between complex stands and openings. Females generally moved more slowly, sinuously, and less variably compared to males. Martens moved more quickly, less sinuously, and more variably during winter compared to summer. However, martens avoided stands with simplified structure, and the altered patterns of movement we observed in those stands suggested that such treatments may negatively affect the ability of martens to forage without increased risk of predation. Fuel treatments that simplify stand structure negatively affected marten movements and habitat connectivity. Given these risks, and because treating fuels is less justified in high elevation forests, the risks can be minimized by applying treatments below the elevations where martens typically occur.

"Whiting, Martin J.; While, Geoffrey M.",Sociality in Lizards,COMPARATIVE SOCIAL EVOLUTION,,390,426,,2017,"Lizards, snakes and amphisbaenians (worm lizards) form a monophyletic group (the squamate reptiles), which contains 9,712 species (Uetz & Hosek, 2015) in 61 families (Wiens, et al., 2012). New species are constantly being described, particularly with the advent of modern molecular systematics and improved access to remote regions. Consequently, this group is likely to be considerably larger in the future (Pyron, et al., 2013). Not only is this a taxonomically diverse group of terrestrial vertebrates, but species occupy a wide range of habitats and ecosystems, and occur on all continents except Antarctica. Furthermore, they span a wide range of body sizes and forms from miniature chameleons and geckos that perch comfortably on a matchstick, to reticulated pythons in excess of 6 m in length. While snakes have traditionally been viewed as a group separate from lizards (e.g. different suborders in traditional taxonomic terms), they are in fact embedded within lizards such that some lizards are more closely related to snakes than they are to other lizards (Wiens, et al., 2012; Pyron, et al., 2013).Squamate reptiles display a wide array of life history strategies, reproductive tactics, and social behaviors that frequently bring males and females into conflict and which are invariably further influenced by high levels of male contest competition (Baird, 2013). As a consequence, most species are polygynous, polyandrous, or both (polygynandry), and many are territorial (Stamps, 1977). However, some species also occur in stable social aggregations (Gardner, et al., 2016). Of these, a small proportion live in family groups with a socially and mostly genetically monogamous parental unit. Interestingly, a single radiation of lizards in Australia (Egernia group of scincid lizards) (Figure 13.1), commonly forms long-term pair bonds and have a particularly high incidence of family[GRAPHICS]living (Chapple, 2003; While, et al., 2015; Gardner, et al., 2016). The Egernia group is a Melanesian-Australian radiation (Gardner, et al., 2008) consisting of seven genera (Egernia, Liopholis, Lissolepis, Bellatorias, Cyclodomorphus, Tiliqua, and Corucia), and is so called because the former Egernia genus was paraphyletic and split into four monophyletic genera. This review will focus primarily upon the evolution of kin-based sociality in lizards with a heavy emphasis on the Egernia group. We draw upon data from snakes only when it helps inform the evolution of kin-based sociality in typical lizards. Our review is therefore admittedly biased towards lizards because our overall goal is to advance our understanding of the evolution of sociality in general, but kinbased sociality in particular.Lizards provide a unique opportunity to understand the early evolution of vertebrate sociality because (1) social behavior is relatively simple and easily quantifiable, (2) social behavior is not obligate (e.g. most species exhibit facultative or temporary forms of group living), and (3) there is enough variation in social strategies, both within and between species, to allow for meaningful tests. In lizards, mating systems vary from monogamy to polygynandry, parental care if present is typically through parent-offspring association (i. e. presence of parent deters potential predators, particularly conspecific adults), with social bonds and interactions between parents and offspring typically less complex than in many avian and mammalian systems (While, et al., 2014a). As such, they offer great potential as models for understanding transitions to more complex forms of social structure and for uncovering the mechanisms that triggered the initial origins as well as the maintenance of family living and sociality in animals (Chapple, 2003; Doody, et al., 2013; While, et al., 2015). To understand the evolution of kin-based sociality in lizards, it is important to first consider the nature of social interactions in lizards more generally, since social selection (sensu Lyon & Montgomerie, 2012) acts on all aspects of social interactions that might lead to pair bonding and group formation (Kavaliers & Choleris, 2013)."

Variable demographic rates can manifest themselves between habitat types in the form of source-sink dynamics where populations in sink habitats would not exist without the addition of migrants from source habitats.Aims. Arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii pleisus (Osgood, 1900)) occupy a large geographic area in northern Canada and live in a variety of habitat types, including boreal forest, low-elevation meadows and alpine meadows, providing an opportunity to investigate the possible existence of source-sink dynamics.Methods. We hypothesised that arctic ground squirrels in the south-western Yukon exhibit demographic characteristics indicative of source-sink dynamics. Boreal forest habitat could be a sink in spite of previous high squirrel densities, whereas meadows could be a source. We investigated this by mark-recapture live-trapping and radio-telemetry.Key Results. In the boreal forest in the Kluane region, we found reduced recruitment, reduced population growth rates (l), and reduced survivorship for radio-collared individuals that moved from low-elevation meadows into the boreal forest. There was no evidence from radio-collared juveniles of dispersal from high-density ground squirrel populations in alpine meadows down into boreal forest.Conclusions. Boreal forest is a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels. Source-sink dynamics observed between low-elevation meadow and boreal forest habitats appear to result from increased predation pressure in the boreal forest. The result has been a near extirpation of boreal forest arctic ground squirrels in the Kluane region since 1998.Implications. Because the source areas of low-elevation meadows occupy only 7-9% of the lowland habitat, recolonisation of boreal forest sites has been very slow. Whereas alpine populations remain high in 2011, boreal forest populations remain near zero. Alpine populations do not appear to be a source for the boreal forest."

The present study examined the changes in performance of three different simple mental task tests after a simulated heavy workload task (similar to 450 kcal/h) in a hot humid environment (30 degrees C WBGT) The treatment was repeated, with work time slightly extended and cognitive tests were repeated to test the stability of the cognitive measures male participants (n = 10) completed two trials (one with a novel cooling vest device and work duration of 98 3 +/- 39 5 min, and without cooling with a duration of 73.5 +/- 26.7 min) and were given short-term memory, arithmetic, and reaction time/tracking tests before and after each trial (termination criterion was a core temperature of 38 7 degrees C) Although sonic individuals displayed practical significant changes, both positive and negative, there were no significant differences (p > 0 05) found between the mean pre-post scores for any of the three tests oil either trial. Comparisons of post-post scores for all three tests showed lower correlation than pre-pre test comparisons suggesting the heat and physical activity did alter cognitive performance. The arithmetic style test appeared to be the most suitable and reliable of the three tests to detect changes in cognitive function.Relevance to Industry. The results of this study are in agreement with past research suggesting that alterations in cognitive function for individuals exposed to physical activity in a hot environment may increase, decrease or change very little While mental processing alterations may widely vary after heat exposure between individuals. a repeated application of an arithmetic style test could help predict workers who will be most negatively affected. Recognition of these individuals could allow supervisors to more effectively manage workers and possibly make the work environment safer in instances where a mental mistake may result in an accident math is a universal and well rehearsed skill that is unlikely to change over short periods of time. The materials needed to conduct a mathematical skill tests are minimal in comparison to other methods, appear to be repeatable within subjects and are both time and cost efficient.

We examined the predatory behavior of smooth-billed anis (Crotophaga ani) on butterflies, and the spacing behavior of the butterflies which were concentrated on a mineral-rich beach on the Cristalino River, in Mate Grosso, Brazil. We studied eight of the most regularly occurring butterfly species which came each morning to engage in puddling. Most species of butterfly were closely associated with conspecifics, although nearest-neighbor distance varied among species. The pierids - yellows (Aphrissa statira, Phoebis trite), oranges (Phoebis argante), and sometimes whites (Daptoneura leucadia) - formed very dense groups (or clusters) of up to 1,000 individuals occasionally joined by a few kite swallowtails (Eurytides spp.). Most other butterfly species formed small groups (e.g., daggerwings, Marpesia spp.) or were dispersed individually and non-clumped over the beach (e.g., dingy purplewing, Eunica monima). Anis foraged using two strategies: rapid frontal attack on dense groups of butterflies (yellows, oranges, whites), and a stealthy approach to solitary butterflies (mainly purplewings) or those in small groups. For yellows, the most common butterfly caught by anis, the capture rate reached over 6 per 15 min per ani, and about 8% of those captured managed to escape. Capture rates were much lower for the other species. Time of day, age of the ani (adult or young-of-the-year), and total number of each butterfly species present accounted for variation in the number of each species captured by anis. The number of butterflies captured per 15 min increased as the number of butterflies present increased, but reached a threshold beyond which the capture rate did not increase. The capture rate per individual butterfly (individual risk) decreased with group size up to a group of 40 individuals and remained low with further increases. Thus a butterfly in a group of 100 was no less likely to be eaten than one in a group of 40. For individual ani forays into dense groups of pierids, an individual ani was unable to catch more than 16, regardless of group size. These data confirm the dilution effect of group size for butterflies; each individual yellow or orange was less at risk from ani predation when in a group."

Cost and risk tradeoffs are especially critical for flocks of wintering waterbirds foraging in lake wetlands. Waterbirds losing suitable habitats face insufficient food supplies and high levels of disturbance, affecting their foraging activities. Our objective was to study the effects of food abundance and disturbances on flock size and the structure of Hooded Crane flocks wintering at Shengjin Lake and, as well, to understand the response of wintering waterbirds to habitat degradation for future management decisions and protection of the population.Methods: We investigated food abundance, disturbances and flock foraging activities of the wintering Hooded Crane in several foraging habitats of Shengjin Lake from November 2013 to April 2014. Flock size and structure were observed by scan sampling. Data on food abundance and disturbances were collected by sampling. Flock size and structure were compared among three wintering stages. The relationship between food resources, disturbances and flock size were illustrated using a generalized linear model.Results: In the early and middle wintering periods, the Hooded Crane used paddy fields as its major foraging habitat, where the number of foraging birds and flocks were the highest. During the late period, the cranes took to meadows as their major foraging habitat. The variation among foraging flock was mainly embodied in the size of the flocks, while the age composition of these flocks did not change perceptibly. Family flocks were notably different from flock groups in size and age composition. The results of a generalized linear model showed that the food abundance had a marked effect on foraging flock size and age composition, while disturbances had a significant effect only on flock size. From our analysis, it appeared that the combined effect of the two variables was significant on the size of the foraging flock, but had less impact on age composition.Conclusions: Food abundance and disturbances affected the flock size of the Hooded Crane. With abundant food and high disturbances, flock sizes increased owing to cooperation in foraging. To avoid competition and maximize foraging benefits, flock size reduces with an abundance of food but low disturbance. By trading off risks and costs, the cranes showed flexible flock distributions and a variety of foraging strategies to maximize benefits and to improve their fitness."

Individuals with different levels of activity budgets, however, may have a hard time synchronizing their behavior to each other without incurring a cost. We predicted that the age and sex structure of a group would affect synchronization levels within a group because of differing individual activity budgets. Individuals in same-sex-age groups were hypothesized to show higher levels of activity synchrony than individuals in mixed sex-age groups. We investigated activity synchrony in adult mate, adult female, subadult, and mixed sex-age groups of Alpine ibex - one of the most sexually dimorphic ruminant species. Activity budgets and movement rates were measured to calculate synchrony of activities between group members in June and July 1999. Adult males were more synchronized with group peers than either females or subadults of both sexes. However, while adult males were synchronized in 81 % when in bachelor (adult mate) groups, they were only synchronized in 65% of the time when in mixed sex-age groups. Adult females were synchronized 61% of their time when in mixed sex-age groups and 69% when in female groups. Individual subadult males displayed higher synchrony when in bachelor or female groups than when in mixed sex-age or subadult mixed-sex groups. Subadult groups and mixed sex-age groups showed the lowest degree of synchrony of all group types. In general, animals in groups of same body-sized individuals were more synchronized with their group members than animals in mixed body-size groups. Two and three year-old males did not adjust their time spent lying to the group but their time spent walking, They also tended to change their time spent grazing and standing according to group type. Among subadults, females spent more time foraging than males but less time lying and standing. There was no difference in time spent walking. Bachelor and subadult groups had the greatest movement rates while female groups were relatively sedentary within escape terrain. Individuals in escape terrain did only marginally synchronize their behavior to each other likely because groups did not move much and synchrony was presumably less important. We conclude that habitat type, group movement rates, and a group's sex-age composition may affect the extent to which an individual will synchronize its activities to the other group members."

"Kikuchi, Ryunosuke",Adverse impacts of wind power generation on collision behaviour of birds and anti-predator behaviour of squirrels,JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION,16,44,55,10.1016/j.jnc.2007.11.001,2008,"Wind power is a fast-growing energy source for electricity production, and some environmental impacts (e.g. noise and bird collision) are pointed out. Despite extensive land use (2600-6000 m(2)/MW), it is said that most of these impacts have been resolved by technological development and proper site selection. The results in this paper suggest that: (i) wind farms kill millions of birds yearly around the world, and the high mortality of rare raptors is of particular concern; (ii) wind farms on migration routes are particularly dangerous, and it is difficult to find a wind power site away from migration routes because there is no guarantee that migration routes will not vary; (iii) according to the presented model of collision probability, the rotor speed does not make a significant difference in collision probability; the hub is the most dangerous part, and large birds (e.g. raptors) are at great risk; and, (iv) based on the field observation of squirrels' vocalisation (i.e. anti-predator behaviour), there are behavioural differences between squirrels at the wind turbine site and those at the control site. Noise from wind turbines (when active) may interfere with the lives of animals beneath the wind turbines.US Government guidelines and the Bern Convention's report have described adverse impacts of wind energy facilities on wildlife and have put forward recommendations. In addition to these documents, the following points derived from the discussion in this paper should be noted for the purpose of harmonising wind power generation with wildlife conservation: (i) engineers need to develop a turbine form to reduce the collision risk at the hub; (ii) institute long-term monitoring, including a comparison between bird mortality before and after construction; and (iii) further evaluate impacts of turbine noise on anti-predator wildlife vocalisations.

We examined how tourists approach free-living kangaroos during encounters in a popular tourism destination in South Australia. We then simulated the typical properties of approaches to quantify the behavioural reactions of two kangaroo species the Red Kangaroo (Macropus ruins) and the Euro (M. robustus erubescens). We also accounted for the disturbance context such as varying environmental conditions (time of day, cover, wind speed) and other factors (species, sex class, grouping) that potentially modify the kangaroos' flight response.Approach varied by access (on-trail, off-trail), transport (on-trail: hiking, driving; off-trail: hiking) and approach style (on-trail: tangential/continuous, tangential/stop-and-go; off-trail: direct/continuous, direct/stop-and-go, direct/stop-and-go/talking, tangential/zigzag/stop-and-go). On-trail, 53% of kangaroos took flight when the closest distance to them was approached whilst (by design) all subjects off-trail took flight. The mean (+/- 1 SE) flight initiation distance (FID) was significantly shorter following an on-trail (78 +/- 2.7 m) than an off-trail approach (90 +/- 2.7 m). Kangaroos fled less often (41% vs. 75%) and spent more time in maintenance activities (40% vs. 10%) if approached in a vehicle than on foot. The mean FID and flight length (FL) after approach on foot was reduced when made in a stop-and-go fashion without talking. Euros fled at a significantly shorter FID with a shorter FL than Red Kangaroos, and so did females with obvious pouch-young compared to females with young-at-foot. FID was shortest if the approach was made in the evenings, the habitat provided cover and the day was calm.The results suggest that wildlife tourists should be educated to the best choice of approach behaviour and viewing conditions to reduce aversive reactions in kangaroos and mediate closer observations to the visitors' greater satisfaction and the kangaroos' better welfare. Our study also shows the benefit of a two-stage approach where the detailed observation of human behaviour serves as a prerequisite to an experimental study on wildlife response.

The NDVI seasonal dynamics in a year with normal weather conditions includes four main phases including the 1st phase of spring NDVI increasing, the 2nd phase of the productivity maximisation of the dominant vegetation, the 3rd phase of the summer progressive decrease in photosynthetic activity in response to the heat and lack of moisture, the 4th phase of low photosynthetic activity lasting from midsummer to the late autumn. The dependence of NDVI on vegetation productivity during its maximum development in the Pre-Urals Steppe in 2016 was described by the linear regression equation. Vegetation productivity on 20 June 2010 and that on 20 June 2016, calculated by the linear regression equation, were compared. The comparison revealed that in 2010, the decline in productivity during vegetation maximum development varied between 19% and 65% depending on the type of plant community. The following plant communities were the least resilient to drought: communities of fallow lands on the locations of previous true steppes, communities which appeared under the influence of overgrazing in the locations of the previous true steppes and the communities of meadow-steppes. Good moistening resulted in a slight decline in productivity communities located in topographical depressions. Productivity of plant communities with early-spring growth of dominating species declined to a lesser degree as the communities are located on a well-warmed surface. Some biological features of the Caragana frutex + Spiraea crenata vegetation type also result in the less decline in productivity. The NDVI coefficient does not accurately reflect productivity at the end of the growing season. Therefore, patterns of declines in productivity of similar vegetation types during the drought in Trans-Urals region in 1998 were used to project the autumn decline in vegetation productivity during the drought in the Pre-Urals Steppe. Based on these findings, the average vegetation productivity in the Pre-Urals Steppe in autumn in dry 2010 were four to five times lower than that during the maximum plant development in 2016 which had favourable weather conditions. As the height of vegetation considerably reduces during drought, the availability of pasture forage may sharply drop in winter, especially if a deep snow cover accumulates and unevenly distributes according to terrain relief. In the Pre-Urals Steppe, only some steppe communities, covering about 20% of the area, are the most accessible to supply Przewalski's horses with dry pasture forage in winter. Projecting the winter supply of pasture forage after a severe drought should be based on the assumption that the forage availability may reduce by 8 to 10 times as compared with calculated summer productivity in a year with favourable weather conditions. In this regard, there is a need to make stocks of hay for feeding horses in winter after a drought. For potentially repeated droughts the sufficient amount of hay to feed Przewalski's horses in the Pre-Urals Steppe over two winter seasons should be stocked in years with normal precipitation as it will be difficult to make the stock in a dry year.For a final assessment of the accessibility of winter pasture forage stock for Przewalski's horses in the Pre-Urals Steppe, some additional field studies of productivity of the main vegetation types at the end of the growing season using the harvest method are necessary as well as an analysis of the distribution and height of snow cover on the territory in years with high winter precipitation."
