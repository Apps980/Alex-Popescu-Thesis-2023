Previous work showed that Florida scrub-jays are sentinels more often when given supplemental food. Here we measured how birds in pairs reacted when their mates were fed. Scrub-jays were sentinels less when their mates were fed, demonstrating compensation. Indirect evidence suggests that this compensatory decrease in sentinel behavior was smaller than the increase in sentinel behavior by their mates. In addition, males in newly established groups were sentinels less often.",NA

We examined further detailed aspects of this cooperative behaviour, including the suggestion that by engaging in this behaviour sentinels advertise their status and gain social prestige. Chosen sentinel locations were higher, but no more exposed, than the best alternative locations within 25 m. Sentinels started off closer to the centre of the foraging group than when sentinel bouts were terminated. Change-overs between sentinels were nearly always due to previous sentinels terminating their own bout. On the rare occasions when bouts were interrupted by upcoming sentinels, physical contact or aggression was extremely rare. Dominant males tended to terminate sentinel bouts of other birds, interrupting especially the dominant females. Other than this, there was no effect of an individual's sex or dominance rank on any aspect of sentinel change-overs or location choice when acting as a sentinel. There were also no differences in any sentinel activity between simple family groups, and those more complex nonfamily groups within which individuals compete for reproduction. Rates of alarm calling did not differ between group members, although dominant males did make more territorial calls to neighbouring groups while acting as a sentinel. Therefore, we found relatively little evidence that individuals compete for the chance to act as a sentinel as a means of showing off within groups of Arabian babblers. Instead, our study confirms the primary function of sentinels as a system of cooperative vigilance. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",NA

Groups of this species consisted of two to seven birds (N = 25). Sentinels were present (mean +- sd) 62% +- 9% of the time, and most sentinel bouts lasted from less than one to six minutes (although in some occasions for more than 30 min.). Overlap of two or more sentinels occurred on average only 3.2% of the time with birds on guard. Sentinels commonly gave contact calls in the beginning and/or at the end of a sentinel bout. The group size had no effect on time with sentinels. However the encounter rate between raptors and groups significantly influenced the time guarded. The results of this study suggests that the ability of sentinels to detect predators may play a central role as an anti-predator device.",NA

Bednekon (1997, American Naturalist, 150, 373-392; 2001, Annales Zoologici Fennici, 38, 5-14) game-theoretic model assumes that group members trade the need to forage against the advantages of earlier risk detection when sentinelling. The model predicts that in the presence of another sentinel which may provide timely alerts, a sentinel will terminate its sentinel bout earlier when its energy level drops below a threshold that is higher than the depletion threshold that would incentivize it to resume foraging if it were sentinelling alone. We propose a complementary hypothesis, that this effect of shortened sentinel duration in the presence of another sentinel will be more pronounced for subordinate group members, for whom the fierce competition they suffer while foraging gets attenuated when a groupmate sentinels. We tested these hypotheses in Arabian babbler, Argya squamiceps, groups by comparing sentinel activity under natural conditions vis-a-vis sentinel activity in a feeding experiment in which one or two individuals were fed. In natural conditions, dominant males not only acted as sentinels longer and more often, but they also initiated a larger share of their sentinel bouts when another group member was already on guard. Following experimental feeding ad libitum, in line with the game-theoretic predictions (1) the probability of starting a sentinel bout was not affected by the presence of another sentinel, nor by its sex or rank, and (2) sentinel bouts that terminated in the presence of another sentinel were significantly shorter than sentinel bouts ending alone. Our findings suggest that the seemingly systematic exchange of sentinels may be a consequence of differential needs and incentives rather than active coordination.

Sentinel behaviour involves a unique cooperative system of dedicated look-outs which protect members of their social group from attack by predators. Using detailed observations from groups of Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps, we tested the original theoretical suggestion that cooperative sentinel systems are simply the result of individually selfish state-dependent patterns of behaviour.2. Sentinel effort and the number of sentinel bouts per individual per hour were greater for males than females, and both increased with individual dominance status within the group.3. Sentinel behaviour was unaffected by group social structure, in terms of patterns of relatedness and the number of potential breeders.4. Total group sentinel effort increased with group size, while the effort per individual decreased irrespective of sex and dominance rank. Simultaneous sentinel behaviour by two or more birds was very rare, but increased with group size.5. Sentinel effort followed seasonal fluctuations in food availability, but not peaks of raptor migration through the study site.6. Body mass was greater for males than females and was positively related to dominance rank. Overall, body mass explained much of the variation in individual sentinel effort both within and between birds. However, data on individual foraging performance could not be related to changes in body mass and thus to differences in sentinel effort.7. Sentinel behaviour in groups of Arabian babblers therefore confirms many of the predictions arising from state-dependent models of cooperative, yet individually selfish, sentinel behaviour.",NA

If sentinel behavior involves a foraging-predation risk trade-off, animals should be sentinels more when fed supplemental food. When individual Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) were fed fragments of peanuts, during the following 30 min they shifted 30% of their time from foraging to sentinel behavior. In a follow-up experiment, we fed either one or two members in each group. As before, the jays reduced their foraging and spent much more time as sentinels when given supplemental food. In each treatment, pairs were sentinels simultaneously considerably less often than expected by chance. The dramatic shift from foraging to sentinel behavior suggests that for Florida scrub-jays sentinel behavior brings substantial benefits for no greater cost than that of lost opportunities to forage. Because the results held for simple mated pairs of scrub-jays, we argue that kin selection and social prestige are not necessary to explain sentinel behavior.",NA

Specifically, we made four predictions: 1. Helpers participate to a non-trivial degree in sentinel behaviour; 2. Breeding pairs with helpers spend less time on sentinel behaviour and hence more time foraging; 3. Breeders with helpers have more protected foraging time; and 4. Groups with helpers have greater total sentinel time.Results of the two studies agreed on most major points and even, in many cases, on minor points and quantitative aspects. Non-breeding adult helper birds participated in sentinel watches almost as much as breeders in their group. In winter, breeding pairs with one or more helpers decreased their own sentinel time compared with that of unassisted pairs. However, in the one study, the concomitantly increased available foraging time of breeders was no better protected by another group member being on sentinel than in the lone pairs. Results of the other study showed a significant increase of protected foraging time for breeding males only. In winter, groups with helpers did not have increased total sentinel time; time was either the same (Study A) or significantly less (Study B). During nesting, breeders with helpers did not, decrease their sentinel effort relative to lone pairs. Instead, groups with helpers had a sentinel for more time. These results are interpreted as indicating that, in winter, sentinel behaviour is more important to antiraptor defense in lone pairs than larger groups. In groups with helpers the mere addition of extra pairs of eyes and ears may render formal sentinel behaviour less necessary, so breeders can decrease their sentinel time and increase their foraging time. During nesting, additional sentinels may be important for increased nest protection. The presence of helpers contributing to predator detection may thus be an important factor in the better annual survival and nesting success of breeders that have helpers (WOOLFENDEN & FITZPATRICK 1984).",NA

All floaters acted as sentinels and uttered 'alarm calls'. This suggests that sentinel activity is due at least, in part, to selfish motives. Floaters sentinelled less than they did as group members, with the decrease in sentinel activity sharper for ex-dominants than for ex-subordinates. One possible explanation for these differences is that sentinel activity is aimed not only at detecting predators, but also at detecting foreign conspecifics. Within a group, the latter incentive is stronger for breeding dominants than for subordinates, whereas all floaters alike may be trying to detect the owners of the territory in which they were roaming but also to avoid being detected by them. Other possible explanations are that floaters have less time and energy for sentinel activity because they are weaker or because foraging is more difficult in a foreign territory. This may be especially so for dominants who used to enjoy privileged access to food in their group. No significant difference was found in the rate of sentinels' 'alarm calls' between floaters and group members, suggesting that their main purpose is predator-prey communication, of which warning groupmates may be a side benefit.",NA

Turdoides squamiceps have proven consistent with state-dependent models of individually selfish anti-predator strategies. Here we demonstrate experimentally that sentinel effort within groups is determined simply hy individual state. The two highest-ranking males in eight groups were separately fed a supplement of mealworms each for one day at a time. Control days before and after each treatment confirmed that Ilo carry-over effects occurred, and that most normal sentinel activity was carried our by alpha males, then beta males and then by. the rest of the group. When supplemented. both alpha and beta males exhibited similar marked increases in sentinel activity relative to control days. Unsupplemented males and the rest of the group incompletely compensated for these increases with reductions in sentinel effort. Differences in individual bod! mass within groups reflected natural and experimental variation in sentinel effort. Alpha and beta males weighed more than other group members, and gained mass only when supplementally fed.

Use of such social information is expected to be adjusted according to its reliability, but experimental tests are rare and tend to focus just on alarm calls. We use detailed behavioral observations, acoustic analyses, and playback experiments to investigate how differences in sentinel dominance status affect the behavioral decisions of foraging dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula). Dominant individuals acted as sentinels considerably more often than subordinate group members and used higher sentinel posts for guarding, making them potentially higher-quality sentinels in terms of experience and optimal positioning for predator detection. Surveillance calls produced during sentinel bouts contained vocal information about dominance status. Playback experiments showed that foragers used surveillance calls to detect sentinel presence and identity, and adjusted their vigilance behavior accordingly. When a dominant sentinel was on duty, compared with a subordinate groupmate, foragers increased reliance on social information, gathered less information through personal vigilance, and focused more on foraging. Our study contributes novel evidence that a major benefit of individual- and class-specific vocalizations is the potential to assess differences in caller information quality.",NA

The optimal balance between sentinel activity and foraging may differ among dominant and subordinate individuals, as dominants are more efficient foragers. Two theoretical models pertain to this balance and predict when individuals with different foraging abilities should switch between the two activities on the basis of their energetic state. In one of these models, individuals must attain a critical energetic level by dusk to pass the night, and in the second model fitness is monotonically increasing with the energetic state. We tested these models in the cooperatively breeding Arabian babbler, Turdoides squamiceps. We measured the length of sentinel bouts and the gaps between them both in natural conditions and following experimental feeding. Following feeding ad libitum, subordinates expanded their sentinel bouts significantly more than dominants in comparison with natural conditions. These findings are consistent with the first model, but not with the second. In the experiment, we measured the mass of mealworms consumed by each individual following a sentinel bout relative to its body mass. This ratio was larger for subordinates, indicating that they ended their sentinel bouts at a lower energetic state than dominants. This finding is consistent with the second model, but not with the first. Immediately after eating ad libitum, in 62% of the cases the first behavior performed by the babblers was a new sentinel bout, but in 17% it was a mutual interaction with a groupmate, indicating that social interactions also play a role in the trade-off vis-a-vis sentinel activity.",NA

Explanations of the evolution of sentinel behavior have frequently relied on kin selection or reciprocal altruism, but recent models suggest that guarding may be an individual's optimal activity once its stomach is full if no other animal is on guard. This paper provides support for this Last explanation by showing that, in groups of meerkats (Suricata suricatta), animals guard from safe sites, and solitary individuals as well as group members spend part of their time on guard. Though individuals seldom take successive guarding bouts, there is no regular rota, and the provision of food increases contributions to guarding and reduces the Latency between bouts by the same individual.",NA

Evidence of a role for intrasexual competition in sentinel behavior,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,27,1461,1470,10.1093/beheco/arw064,2016,"Although the evolutionary mechanisms that favor investment in cooperative behaviors have long been a focus of research, comparatively few studies have considered the role that sexual selection may play. For example, evolutionary explanations for sentinel behavior (where 1 individual assumes an elevated position and scans the surroundings while other group members forage nearby) have traditionally focused on the inclusive fitness benefits arising from its effects on predation risk, while its potential role in defense against intrasexual competitors remains largely unexplored. Here, we provide experimental evidence of a role for sentinel behavior in intrasexual competition, in a cooperatively breeding songbird, the white-browed sparrow weaver (Plocepasser mahali). First, dominant males sentinel substantially more than other group members (even when controlling for variation in age and body condition), consistent with a role for sentineling in intrasexual competition for mates and/or territory. Second, experimental playback of an unfamiliar male's solo song elicited a marked increase in sentineling by the dominant male, and the vocal response to the playback also positively predicted his sentinel effort following the simulated intrusion. A second experiment also suggests that sentineling may facilitate mounting rapid anti-intruder responses, as responses to intruder-playback occurred significantly earlier when the dominant male was sentineling rather than foraging at playback onset. Together, our findings provide rare support for the hypothesis that sentinel behavior plays a role in intrasexual competition, and so highlight the potential for sexually selected direct benefits to shape its expression in this and other social vertebrates.",NA

While it is well established that there is variation due to differences in the costs and benefits for individuals of different sex, age and dominance status, shorter-term social, internal and environmental factors are also likely to be important. Sentinel behaviour, where individuals adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates forage, offers an opportunity to test hypotheses about context-dependent differences in contributions to group behaviour. Here we used field experiments to manipulate the conspecific audience, satiation state and perceived danger level of dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, to investigate how sentinel contributions are modulated by individual context. In addition to standard measures of sentinel behaviour (likelihood of becoming a sentinel, number of bouts, bout duration), we considered within-bout behaviour in terms of surveillance calls and attentiveness (head-scanning rate and distraction levels). We found that the presence of a neighbouring forager (audience) decreased sentinel contributions, while individuals increased their sentinel investment when satiated and experiencing an increased danger level. Changes in head-scanning rate provided evidence for an interaction between the effect of satiation and danger levels, demonstrating that sentinel attentiveness was influenced by changes in context. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour is strongly context dependent, with effects seen in initial bout and bout quantity decisions, as well as within-bout characteristics, and that individual contributions to group behaviours can vary depending on social, internal and environmental factors.

Though the sentinel duty was shared by other members of the group, the breeding birds and other older birds acted more often as sentinels and for a longer duration.

Time spent as a sentinel (perching and scanning from conspicuous locations within sight of the nest) increased with group size, but successful and depredated nests did not differ significantly in sentinel time, and sentinels did not appear to coordinate their vigilance. Both breeder and helper males acted as sentinels, and both were more vigilant when nests contained nestlings than when they contained eggs. Breeders with helpers spent more time as sentinels than those without helpers. Presence of a sentinel reduced the time feeding adults spent pausing to scan when approaching and leaving the nest. Thus, vigilance could enable a male to detect a predator and decoy it away from the nest site or prevent it from locating the nest by deferring feeding visits of other provisioners, but we could not demonstrate that it reduced nest predation by the major nest predator, the Pied Currawong (Strepera graculina).

Predation risk is affected by a range of ecological, social and individual variables, which can fluctuate over different timescales. In general, current risk levels are known to influence the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates are engaged in other activities. However, there has been little consideration of whether decisions made at different stages of a sentinel bout are affected in the same way by perceived predation risk and whether the same level of behavioural plasticity is exhibited when making these different decisions. Here we used detailed behavioural observations and a playback experiment to investigate the behavioural choices of dwarf mongoose sentinels at three different stages of a bout (before, start, during). Individuals were more likely to begin a bout, and did so sooner, following alarm calls, which are immediate, direct indicators of elevated risk. Sentinels selected an initial height from which to guard depending on factors that tended to vary in the medium term (hours), choosing higher positions in denser habitat and less windy conditions. In contrast, decisions about bout duration were made in relation to short-term (seconds/minutes) changes in information, with sentinels guarding for longer when an alarm call was given during a bout, and terminating bouts sooner when groupmates moved out of sight. Our results demonstrate that sentinel decisions are influenced by both direct and indirect indicators of likely predation risk and that sentinel behaviour is adjusted flexibly with regard to information presented on various timescales, highlighting the complexity of decision-making processes.

In addition, individuals may engage in sentinel behaviour and other forms of vigilance, which benefits other group members not only by reducing the risk of predation, but also by allowing them to reduce their own vigilance. It remains unclear, however, whether these vigilance behaviours are selfish, and the benefits to other group members simply an unselected by-product, or whether they are forms of cooperation, and the benefits to group members a selective force favouring the behaviour. In meerkats, Suricata suricatta, both female and male helpers were more likely to perform sentinel behaviour after dependent pups had started joining the group on foraging trips. In addition, female helpers performed more bipedal vigilance and found less food when pups were in the group.

In the former, the onus has been on ecological and demographic factors that select for offspring philopatry; in the latter, the importance of factors such as foraging success and predation risk are more typically emphasized. We examined the association between predation risk and both group size and foraging behaviour in the chestnut-crowned babbler, Pomatostomus ruficeps, a family-living cooperatively breeding bird that does not appear to face classic ecological or demographic constraints on dispersal and breeding. Groups were more likely to encounter, and be attacked by, avian predators when dependent young were present. Large groups were also more likely to encounter a predator, but less likely to be attacked by it, consistent with a benefit of group living through early predator detection or confusion effects. In addition, the average risk of predation for a given individual was reduced in large groups compared to small ones, owing to the dilution effect. That predation might partly select for group living in this species is boosted by findings showing reductions in ground foraging and increases in sentinel behaviour when predation risk was higher. We conclude that predation might represent an important force selecting for sociality in chestnut-crowned babblers, and highlight the need for future studies to consider more explicitly inherent benefits to group living in the evolution of vertebrate cooperative breeding systems. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, examples of such facultative responses are rare. Here, we investigate the response of cooperatively breeding pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) to the drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis), an avian kleptoparasite that regularly follows pied babbler groups, often giving alarm calls to alert the group to predators but also occasionally giving false alarm calls in order to steal food items. We show that pied babbler response to drongos varies markedly according to babbler group size. In small groups, where there are few individuals available to act as sentinels, babblers sentinel less when a drongo is present and respond strongly to drongo alarm calls. However, in large groups, where there are many individuals available to participate in predator vigilance, babblers sentinel more often when a drongo is present, rarely respond to drongo alarm calls, and aggressively displace drongos, with a consequent decline in the number of successful kleptoparasitism events.

We also evaluated the influence of group size on these behaviors. During 60 h of observations on each species, the association was studied in a periurban area in Brazil with scan samplings. The presence of F. rufus increased the frequency of foraging while reducing the time that M. saturninus dedicated to alert/sentinel behaviors.

Although substantial evidence exists for intraspecific variation in responses to other anthropogenic disturbances, this possibility has received relatively little experimental attention with respect to noise. Here, we used field-based playbacks with dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula) to test how traffic noise affects vigilance behavior and to examine potential variation between individuals of different age class, sex, and dominance status. Foragers exhibited a stronger immediate reaction and increased their subsequent vigilance (both that on the ground and as a sentinel) in response to traffic-noise playback compared with ambient-sound playback. Traffic-noise playback also resulted in sentinels conducting longer bouts and being more likely to change post height or location than in ambient-sound playback. Moreover, there was evidence of variation in noise responses with respect to age class and dominance status but not sex. In traffic noise, foraging pups were more likely to flee and were slower to resume foraging than adults; they also tended to increase their vigilance more than adults. Dominants were more likely than subordinates to move post during sentinel bouts conducted in traffic-noise trials. Our findings suggest that the vigilance-foraging trade-off is affected by traffic noise but that individuals differ in how they respond. Future work should, therefore, consider intra-population response variation to understand fully the population-wide effects of this global pollutant.",NA

This hypothesis has been supported in the context of recreational activity in natural environments but it is unknown whether it also applies to urban animals. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the sentinel (territorial vigilance), foraging and vocal behaviours of an urban-dwelling bird, the Rufous Hornero Furnarius rufus, between weekdays and weekends (and holidays) within a university campus in central Brazil. The level of human activity (noise, traffic and pedestrian flow) increases greatly on weekdays on this campus. We predicted that the birds would perceive a greater predation risk and would need to adjust their acoustic signals in response to anthropogenic noise on weekdays. Thus, we expected that the birds would spend more time as sentinels and less time foraging, and would sing for longer periods and at a higher pitch on weekdays than on weekends. We also expected weaker duet responsiveness (answering partner-initiated song) on noisier weekdays than on weekends, assuming that noise would disrupt signal transmission between partners. We found that birds spent slightly more time (similar to 4%) in sentinel behaviour and less time (similar to 2-5%) foraging on weekdays than on weekends, but these effects were small and not statistically significant. Birds were equally likely to sing solos, start duets and answer partner-initiated duets on weekends and weekdays. Finally, phrase duration and acoustic parameters of duets were similar on weekends and weekdays. Our results provide little support for the weekend effect hypothesis, suggesting that these urban-dwelling birds may be habituated or indifferent to periodic variation in human activity levels.",NA

These out-group threats are predicted to affect subsequent within-group interactions (e.g., affiliation and aggression) and individual behavior (e.g., foraging and vigilance decisions). However, experimental investigations of such consequences are rare, especially in natural conditions. We used field-based call playbacks and fecal presentations on habituated wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula)-a cooperatively breeding, territorial species-to examine postinteraction responses to the simulated threat of a rival group. Dwarf mongooses invested more in grooming of groupmates, foraged closer together, and more regularly acted as sentinels (a raised guard) after encountering indicators of rival-group presence compared to control conditions. These behavioral changes likely arise from greater anxiety and, in the case of increased vigilance, the need to seek additional information about the threat. The influence of an out-group threat lasted at least 1 h but individuals of different dominance status and sex responded similarly, potentially because all group members suffer costs if a contest with rivals is lost.

We used hair dye to dull epaulets of free-living territorial males prior to pair formation to determine if manipulated males experienced disadvantages in comparison with control males. We found no differences between control males and males with dulled epaulets in territorial behavior (territory size, song rate, trespass rate, and loss of territory), paternal care (time spent on territory and in antipredator sentinel behavior, and response to a model crow to simulate the threat of predation), pairing success (number of social mates), apparent reproductive success (numbers of nesting attempts, eggs/nest, nestlings/egg, and fledglings/nestling), or realized reproductive success (numbers of within-pair, extra-pair, and total fledglings as determined by DNA fingerprinting). We then used a meta-analysis of 11 published studies of Red-winged Blackbirds to determine if there is an overall effect of epaulet color or size on male-male competition, female choice, or reproductive success. Our results show that epaulet size has a small positive effect on male reproductive success, but epaulet color has no effect on male-male competition, female choice, and male reproductive success. One explanation for the seeming contradiction between studies that show that epaulets are necessary for territory defense and those that conclude that epaulets are not currently under selection is that epaulets serve as one of several cues of species recognition, especially among males at close range. An alternative explanation proposes counter-balancing intersexual advantages and intrasexual disadvantages of epaulet expression. Additional studies are needed to test these alternatives.",NA

Coordinated vigilance, including unique sentinel behavior, is rare in nature, since it is time-consuming and limited in terms of benefits. No evidence showed animals adopt alternative vigilance strategies during antipredation scanning yet. Considering the nonindependent nature of both synchronization and coordination, we assessed whether group members could keep alert synchronously or in a coordinated fashion under different circumstance. We studied how human behavior and species-specific variables impacted individual and collective vigilance of globally threatened black-necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) and explored behavior-based wildlife management. We tested both predation risk (number of juveniles in group) and human disturbance (level and distance) effects on individual and collective antipredation vigilance of black-necked crane families. Adults spent significantly more time (proportion and duration) on scanning than juveniles, and parents with juveniles behaved more vigilant. Both adults and juveniles increased time allocation and duration on vigilance with observer proximity. Deviation between observed and expected collective vigilance varied with disturbance and predation risk from zero, but not significantly so, indicating that an independent vigilance strategy was adopted by black-necked crane couples. The birds showed synchronized vigilance in low disturbance areas, with fewer juveniles and far from observers; otherwise, they scanned in coordinated fashion. The collective vigilance, from synchronized to coordinated pattern, varied as a function of observer distance that helped us determine a safe distance of 403.75 m for the most vulnerable family groups with two juveniles. We argue that vigilance could constitute a prime indicator in behavior-based species conservation, and we suggesting a safe distance of at least 400 m should be considered in future tourist management.",NA

We found that males were more likely to be at the front of group progressions, especially in contexts of increased risk, were more vigilant, sometimes to the point of becoming sentinels, were more active in mobbing, and were far more likely to counter-attack felids and monkey-eating raptors than females did. Our evaluation showed that these services may be an expression of male parental care or aimed at bonded partners, but we also encountered many cases in which non-sires, unrelated to either females or immatures, provide them. We hence investigate explanations invoking group augmentation or costly signalling.

Male vigilance may function as a deterrent of extrapair copulation attempts (EPCs) or to ensure male survival, because males of sexually dimorphic species may be more conspicuous to predators than females. However, vigilant males may act as antipredator sentinels to enhance female survivorship, which may also allow females to feed and rest more efficiently, thereby enhancing their ability to form clutches. We attempted to distinguish between the male benefits and female benefits hypotheses by studying the behavior of unpaired males and paired Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) during the preincubation period. Paired males were, on average, four times more vigilant than unpaired males and their mates, which suggests that elevated levels of vigilance by paired males does not function primarily for self-protection against predators. Males were not more vigilant during the female's fertile period, contrary to the paternity assurance hypothesis. Male vigilance during feeding bouts was highest when pairs fed alone near shore-a condition in which feeding was likely more risky. Male vigilance was positively correlated with female feeding when females fed near shore, but not at other times. During resting bouts, males were vigilant 14 +/- 0.01% of the time in all conditions. We suggest that male vigilance may be important to enhance female survival, especially when females feed under risky conditions.",NA

Polyandrous trios consisted of a female and male breeder, as well as a subordinate co-breeding male. Pale chanting goshawk males performed most of the interspecific territorial maintenance duties, as well as participating in aggressive intraspecific interactions against other males on territory borders. Intraspecific territorial interactions were almost exclusively recorded in high-quality habitat, Karroid Broken Veld, and probably functioned in the defence of foraging habitat and potential mates. In this habitat, males of polyandrous families largely occupied exclusive sections of a territory. It is suggested that the cost of defending territories in Karroid Broken Veld was offset by the co-breeder's contribution to high-risk, intraspecific territorial defence. During the nestling period females of polyandrous trios stayed at nesting sites for longer periods than did monogamous females and all males, enabling these females to guard the nest and act as sentinels. Predation of nestlings was recorded at the nests of monogamous pairs, but not at those of polyandrous trios. Go-breeders did not guard the nesting site but contributed directly to nest defence by either coming to the female's aid when solicited, or attacking potential predators when present at the nesting site. Go-breeders may also have helped indirectly, through activities such as provisioning prey to females that relieved them of their hunting duties. We suggest that the female's nest guarding and the resulting lower nest predation may hold reproductive and fitness benefits for polyandrous breeders.",NA

In addition to reproductive skew, group members may also exhibit social skew, where some individuals show particular behaviors more often than others. Significant social skew in behaviors such as anti-predator defense or social interactions may influence survival and reproduction. Therefore, social skew has the potential to translate into reproductive skew and affect group productivity. We measured social skew across groups in a population of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). Several behaviors such as agonistic interactions, affiliative interactions, and first emergence were significantly skewed in most groups. Alarm calling, however, was infrequently skewed more than would be expected by random chance. Thus, marmot groups do not appear to have behavioral roles in terms of individuals acting like sentinels. Although significant social skew was present, it did not obviously affect fitness as measured by female reproductive success for each group. However, skew in individual-directed behavior (e.g. agonistic and affiliative interactions) did significantly correlate with the level of reproductive skew. Finally, the results were independent of the scale at which groups were defined. Behavioral variability appears to occur similarly across the entire marmot population. The results of this study illustrate that the quantification of social skew has potential to be a powerful tool for understanding the evolution of sociality.",NA

We continuously video-monitored behaviour at dens of four captive, genetically pure, dingo pairs (one litter each) during the first three postpartum weeks just before the start of weaning. Mothers occupied the den almost continuously during the night, but significantly less so during the day, and consistently spent most den time nursing. Fathers were largely absent from inside the den despite lack of apparent aggression from females, low outside temperatures, and space for them inside.

Scrub-jays in suburban habitats had access to ad libitum human-provided foods; wildland jays did not.

Neither time spent foraging or perching nor food consumption rates significantly influenced variation in time of breeding among individuals. Time of breeding was significantly influenced by site, year, and rate of food handling.

The colony is located along a river terrace near the south entrance of Yellowstone National Park. The home-burrow is where the young are reared, where an animal normally spends the night, and where an animal goes when an alarm call is given. Auxiliary burrows are used temporarily as a place of refuge. The burrows are connected by a trail system that directs the movements of the animals. The distribution of adults and litters indicated a preference for burrows in the central part of the colony. Patterns of home range were of three types, those with no overlap, those with slight overlap and those with major overlap. Animals which utilized the same home range frequently avoided one another. The shape of the home range depended primarily on the nearness of the feeding area. Agonistic behavior modified both size and shape of home ranges. Changes in home range from year to year were correlated with changes in the individuals occupying home-burrows. The animals emerged from their burrows at about sunrise, had a morning peak of activity, a midday low and a second peak of activity in the late afternoon. All entered their burrows by 30 minutes after sunset. Communication between marmots involved the senses of sight, smell, touch, and, most importantly, hearing. The alarm call was given in response to any kind of intrusion into the life of the colony. No particular animal acted as a sentinel. Olfactory communication consisted of the greeting in which two animals sniffed each other's cheeks. One or two animals were dominant. Several tended to be submissive to all with which they had contact. Other relationships seem best characterized by a kind of neutrality in which each of the two animals avoids the other. Territorial behavior does not seem to occur in the yellow-bellied marmot. Hibernation began in the second week of August. Conflicts and alert calls were less numerous and activity in general greatly decreased. Increased wandering was shown by some adults. Agonistic behavior may be one of the factors that limits the number of marmots on a colony site. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author",NA

Here, we investigated the onset of sentinel behaviour and the ontogeny of the different sentinel call types as well as the development of individual vocal signatures in meerkats. We found that meerkats started acting as a sentinel around 200 days of age, but this was highly dependent on group size, with individuals from smaller groups exhibiting sentinel behaviour earlier than individuals from larger groups. All six sentinel call types were already present in the repertoire upon first emergence of the behaviour; however, call rates of 'all-clear' calls increased while 'warning' calls decreased with increasing experience as sentinel. Analysis of one of the most frequent sentinel calls, the double note calls, indicated that fundamental frequency, mean amplitude, duration and entropy differed consistently between individuals, but we found no effect of age. Rather, our results provide evidence that individual signatures in this call type were already developed when young meerkats first started to act as sentinel and changed little with age. To conclude, we showed little ontogenetic change in overall sentinel behaviour as well as in its vocal coordination, indicating potentially high selection pressures on antipredator behaviours, such as the sentinel system, resulting in consistent behavioural responses upon first emergence.

However, whether signals evolved for communication with other species, or are in fact conspecific signals eavesdropped upon by partners, is often unclear. Fork-tailed drongos (Dicrurus adsimilis) associate with mixed-species groups and often produce true alarms at predators, whereupon associating species flee to cover, but also false alarms to steal associating species' food (kleptoparasitism). Despite such deception, associating species respond to drongo non-alarm calls by increasing their foraging and decreasing vigilance. Yet, whether these calls represent interspecific sentinel signals remains unknown. We show that drongos produced a specific sentinel call when foraging with a common associate, the sociable weaver (Philetairus socius), but not when alone. Weavers increased their foraging and decreased vigilance when naturally associating with drongos, and in response to sentinel call playback. Further, drongos sentinel-called more often when weavers were moving, and weavers approached sentinel calls, suggesting a recruitment function. Finally, drongos sentinel-called when weavers fled following false alarms, thereby reducing disruption to weaver foraging time. Results therefore provide evidence of an 'all clear' signal that mitigates the cost of inaccurate communication. Our results suggest that drongos enhance exploitation of a foraging mutualist through coevolution of interspecific sentinel signals.",NA

This study focuses on whether guarding in captive meerkats exhibits a pattern similar to that described for wild groups. Sentinel behavior in captivity has been somewhat neglected because predation is usually not a critical factor. Nonetheless, observations in captivity might reveal whether individual or group experience influences this specific behavior pattern. We observed three captive meerkat groups (in outdoor as well as indoor enclosures) and analyzed the duration of guarding sequences, the number of established guards, the guard posture, and the individual guard positions. We also conducted playback experiments to investigate the reaction of the sentinel and the group to bird calls (songbird vs. predatory bird species). The results demonstrated that captive groups behave much the same as wild groups. Certain individuals performed the guard job more often than other group members. Accordingly, the super sentinels observed in the wild also exist in captive groups. Playbacks showed that the sentinels reacted more strongly to the calls of predatory bird species, indicating that captive meerkats are able to categorize bird calls. We also documented major differences in behavioral responses to the calls of specific predatory bird species. Our observations underline that sentinel behavior is probably a combination of an innate, imprinted pattern that is further affected by the experience. Future studies might further investigate this influence of experience, beyond innate behavior, on the group-specific sentinel behavior pattern in captive meerkats.",NA

The presence of sentinels is known to be an effective form of defence amongst stable groups of individuals within cooperative and polygynous breeding systems. However, the presence of sentinels in the more prevalent socially monogamous breeding systems remains overlooked as an important benefit of such partnerships. Here, we describe a study in which we examined the presence and effectiveness of sentinels in a wild population of the socially monogamous zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). We found that when experimentally approached by a human observer during incubation, birds flushed from their nests at significantly greater distances when their reproductive partner was acting as a sentinel than when the partner was absent. The distance at which birds flushed was not influenced by the approach direction of the human observer, the gender of the incubating bird, the presence of conspecifics, the habitat type or the size of the breeding colony. Our results indicate that sentinels are an effective anti- predator defence amongst socially monogamous birds, and may represent a neglected benefit of the formation of stable social partnerships in birds. We suggest that whilst recent work has focused on the sexual conflicts that occur between males and females in socially monogamous pairs, we should not lose sight of the benefits that individuals may gain from their partner.",NA

In particular, grooming is often exchanged for itself or other commodities, such as coalitionary support or access to food and mates. More contentious is the possibility that nonhuman animals can rely on memories of recent events, providing contingent cooperation even when there is a temporal delay between two cooperative acts. Here we provide experimental evidence of delayed cross-commodity grooming exchange in wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula). First, we use natural observations and social-network analyses to demonstrate a positive link between grooming and sentinel behavior (acting as a raised guard). Group members who contributed more to sentinel behavior received more grooming and had a better social-network position. We then used a field-based playback experiment to test a causal link between contributions to sentinel behavior and grooming received later in the day. During 3-h trial sessions, the perceived sentinel contributions of a focal individual were either up-regulated (playback of its surveillance calls, which are given naturally during sentinel bouts) or unmanipulated (playback of its foraging close calls as a control). On returning to the sleeping refuge at the end of the day, focal individuals received more grooming following surveillance-call playback than control-call playback and more grooming than a matched individual whose sentinel contributions were not up-regulated.

Individuals can acquire such information by observing the behaviour of others, but reliance on visual cues may be undermined by visual obstructions and social monitoring is often incompatible with foraging. Vocal communication does not require the close proximity of senders and receivers or the suspension of other activities, and there is increasing evidence that foragers can use vocalizations to inform decisions about their own vigilance. However, less work has focused on what factors influence signallers in this context. We used detailed behavioural observations and a playback experiment manipulating perceived risk to investigate the calling behaviour of dwarf mongoose sentinels. Sentinels vocalized more often in dense habitats and when foragers were further away, when visual cues were less likely to be useful. Sentinels also vocalized more in situations most advantageous to others, including when groupmates were likely to be distracted (e.g. when babysitting or foraging) and following an alarm call; sentinels may provide an 'all clear' signal. Call rate was reduced in high-risk situations, such as immediately after an alarm call. Individuals of different age, sex and dominance status varied in their likelihood of calling and their response to situations of similar risk, probably because of different cost-benefit trade-offs for separate classes. Our study offers strong evidence that dwarf mongoose sentinels are adjusting their vocal behaviour both to enhance the likelihood that groupmates are aware of their presence and to provide potentially valuable social information about current risk.

We suggest that in some cases this may be because parasites provide victims with mitigating benefits, paradoxically giving rise to selection for advertisement rather than concealment by parasites. We investigate this possibility using the interaction between an avian kleptoparasite, the fork-tailed drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis), and one of its victims, the pied babbler (Turdoides bicolor). Combining field observations and a playback experiment, we demonstrate that a conspicuous vocal signal broadcast by drongos perched waiting to steal food from foraging babblers allows the latter to improve their own foraging efficiency, although not to the same extent as that experienced in response to conspecific sentinel calling. We argue that sentinel calling by drongos may originally have arisen as a means of manipulating babblers: because babblers find more food items and venture into the open more in response to these vocalizations, drongos are presented with more kleptoparasitism opportunities. However, the resulting benefit to babblers could be sufficient to reduce selection for the evolution of defenses against drongos, and the current situation may represent a rare example of an interspecific relationship in transition from a parasitism to a mutualism.",NA

Accurate information about immediate safety while foraging may be provided by the sentinel, a high-perched non-foraging Babbler that actively scans and warns for predators. We tested whether, at this migratory hotspot, the bewildering number and diversity of potential avian predators (perhaps more than anywhere else in the world) may be more than a reliable sentinel could handle. We monitored ten Babbler groups regularly for a number of hours per day throughout the migration season, and scored whether the Babblers gave alarm calls when different bird species were in sight. Analyses showed that Babblers are very skilled in distinguishing between species of high and low predation threat (interspecific threat-sensitivity). In addition, Babblers distinguished accurately between encounters with dangerous vs. harmless individuals from predator species of potentially high predation threat (intraspecific threat-sensitivity). Overall, Babblers cautiously overestimated predation threat, probably because errors involving alarms for harmless predators have a lower fitness cost than errors involving attacks by dangerous predators that are ignored. However, fewer warnings were given for the more common predators of lower threat, which suggests that Babblers initially overestimated the risk of predation, but subsequently learned to assess the level of threat more accurately as soon as more information was available. Overall, our findings agree closely with theoretical predictions regarding adaptive and sophisticated anti-predation behaviour in a variable world.",NA

Recent studies have shown the cascading effects of predation risk on ecosystems through changes in prey behavior. Minimizing predation risk may explain why multiple prey species associate together in space and time. For example, mixed-species flocks that have been widely documented from forest systems, often include birds that eavesdrop on sentinel species (alarm calling heterospecifics). Sentinel species may be pivotal in (1) allowing flocking species to forage in open areas within forests that otherwise incur high predation risk, and (2) influencing flock occurrence (the amount of time species spend with a flock). To test this, we conducted a short-term removal experiment in an Amazonian lowland rainforest to test whether flock habitat use and flock occurrence was influenced by sentinel presence. Antshrikes (genus Thamnomanes) act as sentinels in Amazonian mixed-species flocks by providing alarm calls widely used by other flock members. The alarm calls provide threat information about ambush predators such as hawks and falcons which attack in flight. We quantified home range behavior, the forest vegetation profile used by flocks, and the proportion occurrence of other flocking species, both before and after removal of antshrikes from flocks. We found that when sentinel species were removed, (1) flock members shifted habitat use to lower risk habitats with greater vegetation cover, and (2) species flock occurrence decreased. We conclude that eavesdropping on sentinel species may allow other species to expand their realized niche by allowing them to safely forage in high-risk habitats within the forest. In allowing species to use extended parts of the forest, sentinel species may influence overall biodiversity across a diverse landscape.",NA

Many studies suggest animals also reduce predation risk by eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls, allowing them to occupy otherwise risky habitats. One unexplored area of study is understanding how different species' alarms vary in quality, and how this variation is distributed in the landscape. We tested this phenomenon in a unique system of avian mixed species flocks in Amazonian rainforests: flock mates (eavesdropping species) strongly associate with alarm-calling antshrikes (genus Thamnomanes), which act as sentinel species. Up to 70 species join these flocks, presumably following antshrike behavioral cues. Since flocks in this region of the Amazon are exclusively led by a single antshrike species, this provides a unique natural system to compare differences in sentinel quality between flocks. We simulated predation threat by flying three species of live trained raptors (predators) towards flocks to compare sentinel probability to (1) produce alarm calls, and (2) encode information about magnitude and type of threat within such alarm calls. Our field experiments show significant differences in the probability of different sentinel species to produce alarm calls and distinguish predators. This variation may have important fitness consequences and shape the landscape of fear for eavesdropping species.",NA

At the Amazonian sites, the understory flocks with T. caesius are similar in composition among sites and very distinct from the canopy flocks. Canopy flocks are similar in composition across sites in Amazonia, but only at one site did a sentinel species, Lanio versicolor in Rondonia, play a significant role. Flocks in Espirito Santo differed substantially from Amazonian flocks. Flocks with T. caesius were not strongly differentiated from canopy flocks. Flocks were less stable and T. caesius appeared to play a less obvious role as a sentinel.

The solution to both is to obtain continuous estimates of background risk, enabling vigilance to be concentrated during the riskiest periods and informing about the likely cost of ignoring warnings. Human surveillance organizations routinely produce such estimates, frequently derived from indirect cues. Here we show that vigilant individuals in an animal society (the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor) perform a similar role. We ask (i) whether, in the absence of direct predator threats, pied babbler sentinels react to indirect information associated with increased risk and whether they communicate this information to group mates; (ii) whether group mates use this information to adjust their own vigilance, and whether this influences foraging success; and (iii) whether information provided by sentinels reduces the likelihood of inappropriate responses to alarmcalls. Using playback experiments, we show that: (i) sentinels reacted to indirect predator cues (in the form of heterospecific alarm calls) by giving graded surveillance calls; (ii) foragers adjusted their vigilance in reaction to changes in surveillance calls, with substantial effects on foraging success; and (iii) foragers reduced their probability of responding to alarm calls when surveillance calls indicated lowered risk. These results demonstrate that identifying attacks as they occur is only part of vigilance: equally important is continuous surveillance providing information necessary for individuals to make decisions about their own vigilance and evasive action. Moreover, they suggest that a major benefit of group living is not only the increased likelihood of detecting threats, but a marked improvement in the quality of information available to each individual.",NA

Our results revealed that scimitarbills underwent significant behavioural changes in the presence of social pied babblers: they reduced their vigilance rate by over 60%, increased their foraging efficiency and expanded their niche by moving into open habitat and excavating subterranean food items. In contrast, pied babblers - who have an effective intraspecific sentinel system - did not show significant behavioural changes to the presence or alarm calls of scimitarbills.

The declines have taken place simultaneously with human-induced loss and deterioration of habitats due to eutrophication and overgrowth. To Investigate mechanisms by which habitat changes could affect breeding success and ultimately population dynamics, we studied an endangered coastal population of Temminck's stint. We hypothesized that the rate of nest predation has become higher because the nest defence strategy (early detection of predator and early departure from the nest), which originally evolved in open habitats, is less effective on shores with reduced visibility. As predicted. nests survived better on wide than on narrow shores. Predation made a major contribution to this trend. although successful and predated nests did not differ in concealment at a microhabitat scale. The better the visibility from the nest, the longer was the flushing distance, but only in response to alarm calls or behaviour of other species, not when they were absent. Temminck's stints seem to obtain information about an approaching predator visually from sentinels. Therefore, it is essential that there is at least moderate visibility around the nest. We conclude that habitat characteristics - visibility from the nest and sentinel birds - affect the effectiveness of the nest defence strategy of Temminck's stint. These should be taken into account when seeking causes and mechanisms for declines of Temminck's stint and other waders of open and shortly vegetated shores.",NA

Our results show that feeding and foraging behavior is also influenced by light intensity, suggesting a preference for crepuscular periods of the day.

The aim of this study was to assess the features shown by these nuclear species. I quantified parameters of sociality, communication and alertness of nuclear bird species in mixed flocks with different composition. Parameters related to sociality (mean intraspecific group size) and communication (frequency of contact calls) were not correlated with the leadership. On the other hand, the most alert species was in the front of a given mixed flock most of the time. The leader species spent more time in vigilance and gave most alarm calls due to approaching raptors earlier. The results of this study strongly suggest that the alertness of a species is the major character of nuclear bird species in mixed flocks of the campo-cerrado.",NA

I studied the social organization of the little-known rock-haunting possum in Kakadu National Park in Northern Australia. Preliminary field observations revealed that the majority of possums live in cohesive groups consisting of a female-male pair and young, suggesting a monogamous mating system. I used radiotracking to determine home range patterns, and observations to measure the degree of symmetry between The sexes in maintaining the pair bond and initiating changes in group activity. I also measured the extent of maternal and paternal indirect and direct care. Nocturnal observations and radiotelemetric data from 3 years showed that six possum groups maintained nonoverlapping home range switch long-term;consorts and young sharing dens. Males contributed more than females to maintaining the pair bond but they contributed equally to parental care. For the first time, the parental behaviours of bridge formation, embracing, marshalling of young, sentinel behaviour and tail beating are reported in a marsupial. Males participated to a high degree in maintaining relationships with one mate and their offspring.

However, progress has been limited thus far due to differences in approaches between psychologists and behavioral ecologists. Although the former tend to use controlled experiments to pinpoint precise cognitive mechanisms, these experiments often lack ecological validity. In contrast, behavioral ecologists seek to understand the adaptive function of cooperative behavior of animals in the wild but typically neglect the underlying psychological mechanisms. Here we appraise and integrate evidence from these two approaches to understand the potential cognitive solutions to four fundamental challenges that animals face during cooperative interactions under natural conditions: (1) when to cooperate; (2) with whom to cooperate; (3) what to do in cooperative interactions; (4) how much to contribute to cooperation. We argue that an ecologically motivated approach is critical to understanding the psychological mechanisms of cooperation and how these mechanisms evolve.",NA

Secondly, we examined the influence of relatedness on scan effort (percent overlapping) and temporal distribution of scanning using linear regression. Finally, we evaluated whether temporal distributions of scanning were significantly lower (coordination) or higher (synchrony) than random expectations using bootstrapping. We found that pairwise relatedness between focal degus and their foraging partner did not influence the scan effort or the temporal distribution of scanning. These original, field-based findings imply that vigilance behavior in socially foraging degus is unlikely to be kin-selected and adds to results from previous lab studies in that kinship remains a poor predictor of social behavior in these animals. Overall, our study adds to others revealing that kin selection may not have had an impact on aspects of social behavior such as vigilance during social foraging.",NA

I analyzed habitat use and behavioral time budget data for a Texas population of the Western Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma californica), As a non-cooperative population, one of two habitat-use patterns was expected: (1) specialist habitat-use patterns in an abundant, widespread habitat type, with little variation among territories in habitat composition or (2) generalist habitat-use patterns with the potential of significant variation in habitat composition among territories. These jays show a combination of habitat-use patterns supporting both predictions. The only resources that males utilize as a specialist, tall oak trees during sentinel behavior, are fairly widespread and would not be considered a limiting resource. In the remaining habitat categories, Texas populations of Western Scrub-Jays act as generalists, using the habitat in relation to its availability, even though variation in habitat composition among territories is considerable. Variation among individuals within a sex was observed but could not be explained using various demographic and ecological correlates. Additional detailed habitat use data when used in a comparative framework can aid determination of subtle ecological differences among populations of Western Scrub-Jays and allow closer examination of intrinsic and extrinsic ecological models concerning the evolution and maintenance of cooperative breeding systems in this group.",NA

I collected 104 case studies from 50 publications. The partner animals included 19 mammal species, 33-34 bird species, 1 reptile species, and 1-2 insect species, respectively. Among them, associations with non-primate mammals (n=43) and birds (n=59) occupied most of the reported cases. Many polyspecific associations between primates and other mammal species were reported from Asia and Africa, while those between primates and bird species were reported from Central and South America. 34 primate species worldwide formed associations with non-primate animals. Polyspecific associations between primates and other animals included 1) that primates (or other animals) provide food resources to their partner animals and 2) that primates (or other animals) provide anti-predator behavior (e.g., sentinel behavior, loud call, and alarm call). The former association increases foraging benefits to the partner animals, and the latter association decreases predation risk of the partner animals. Most studies, however, pointed out that benefit from given associations are commensalisic, (or even parasitism), i. e. biased to non-primate species. Most of these studies are anecdotal, and do not show quantitative data for the frequency of the association or the benefit of partner animals from participating in the associations. Thus, this interesting phenomenon has not been discussed from an ecological perspective. I recommend several approaches for how to overcome these present challenges.",NA

Based on this principle of marginal predation, he developed a two-dimensional model involving geometric probability and domains of danger. Consequently, centripetal instincts for survival would have stimulated the development of sociable species. In determining domains of danger for the animal aggregations in this study, two other dimensions are present: one geometric, vertical positioning (height); and one social, altruism.

Results of initially informal as well as experimental observations are presented to begin to define the basic parameters for the behavior.

These skills may be particularly important for animals that live in large groups, because the intricacies of social life may become more complex when more individuals are involved. Previous research has found that species with regular social interactions tend to show elevated cognitive performance relative to those that rarely interact, yet intraspecific variation in performance among individuals in social groups of varying size is rarely explored. We investigated the relationship between the ability to solve an associative learning task and group size among individuals of a free-living, social bird, the Australian magpie (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis). Individuals varied in their likelihood of interacting with and solving the task. Individuals from larger groups were more likely to approach the associative learning task, suggesting that group size influences individual propensity to attempt a novel task. However, group size did not influence the likelihood that individuals solved the task. Rather, age had an important effect; adults were more likely to solve the association task than juveniles. Our finding that free-living individuals occurring in large social groups were more likely to interact with a novel task suggests that group size may affect differences in performance at a cognitive task within a species.",NA

Visual perception and information transfer affect vigilance coordination in foraging groups,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,15,898,906,10.1093/beheco/arh092,2004,"Animals frequently raise their heads to check for danger. In a group, individuals generally raise their heads independently. Earlier models suggest that all group members could gain by coordinating their vigilance, i.e., each member raising its head when others are not. We re-examine these suggestions, considering groups of different sizes, in light of empirical findings that: (1) animals can sometimes detect a predator without raising their heads, and (2) when one member of a group detects a predator, the information does not always spread to other members of the group. Including these effects in models generally decreases the value of coordinated vigilance. Coordinated vigilance is highly favored only when animals have a low probability of detecting predators without lifting their heads but a high probability of being warned when another member of the group detects a predator. For other combinations, coordinated vigilance has little value and may have a negative value. Group size has contrasting effects depending on how social information is obtained. Coordination is favored in smaller groups when one or more detecting individuals provide a constant amount of information to individuals unaware of the predator. On the other hand, coordination is favored in larger groups if each detecting individual provides unaware individuals with an independent source of information (i.e., if the amount of information increases as the number of detecting individuals increases). These results depend on the balance of an escape due to social information and dilution of risk in groups with imperfect information spread. This framework could be tested by examining species with different visual fields and in different environments.",NA

Cooperative predator defense can enhance nest success and adult survival but, because it is inherently risky, dynamic risk assessment theory predicts that individuals modify defense behavior according to the risk posed by the predator. Parental investment theory, on the other hand, predicts that reproductive payoffs (brood value) determine investment in nest defense. We propose that, in cooperative breeders, fitness benefits deriving from the survival of other group members may additionally influence defense behavior (social group benefits theory). We tested predictions of these theories in the cooperatively breeding purple-crowned fairy-wren, Malurus coronatus, where brood value is higher for breeders, but social group benefits more important for helpers. We recorded experimentally induced individual defense behaviors in response to predator models presented near nests, representing differing levels of threat to nests and adults. As predicted, 1) individuals engaged in less risky defenses when encountering a more dangerous predator (dynamic risk assessment theory); 2) individuals defended older broods more often, and breeders defended more than helpers (parental investment theory); and 3) helpers were more likely to respond to a predator of adults (social group benefits theory). Our findings highlight that predator defense in cooperative breeders is complex, shaped by the combination of immediate risk and multiple benefits.",NA

Most studies of the effects of neighbors on vigilance have focused on individual vigilance. We investigated the effects of neighbors on vigilance in wild red-necked pademelons Thylogale thetis foraging at night in nonpersistent aggregations in a clearing in rain forest. Neither the total number of pademelons in the clearing nor the numbers at various distances around focal individuals affected the individual vigilance of focal animals. However, focal animals' individual vigilance did change with the distance to their nearest neighbor and also with distance to cover. Pairs of individuals closer than 10 m apart tended to synchronize their bouts of individual vigilance and foraging. The degree of synchrony within pairs increased with both distance to cover and the total number of pademelons foraging in the area and decreased with increasing distance to the pair's nearest neighbor but did not vary with the distance separating the members of the pair. Thus, despite their individual vigilance being unaffected by the number of other pademelons in the feeding aggregation, pademelons were nonetheless sensitive to the presence of conspecifics and adjusted their behavior in relation to their separation from neighbors. Thus, some vigilance benefits may be obtained from the presence of conspecifics even in species that aggregate only temporarily on food patches without forming more permanent social groups.",NA

Here we investigate group size effects in the evolutionary dynamics of games in which individuals choose whether to cooperate or defect and payoffs do not depend directly on the size of the group. We find that increasing the group size decreases the proportion of cooperators at both stable and unstable rest points of the replicator dynamics. This implies that larger group sizes can have negative effects (by reducing the amount of cooperation at stable polymorphisms) and positive effects (by enlarging the basin of attraction of more cooperative outcomes) on the evolution of cooperation. These two effects can be simultaneously present in games whose evolutionary dynamics feature both stable and unstable rest points, such as public goods games with participation thresholds.

Controlling for group size, we studied the effect of sex on vigilance in the sexually dimorphic eastern grey kangaroo Macropus giganteus, analysing vigilance at two structural levels: individual vigilance and the group's collective vigilance. Knowing that group members in this species tend to synchronise their bouts of vigilance, we tested (for the first time) whether sex affects the degree of synchrony between group members. We found that females were individually more vigilant than males and that their vigilance rate was unaffected by the presence of males. Collective vigilance did not differ between female-only and mixed-sex groups of the same size. Vigilance in mixed-sex groups was neither more nor less synchronous than in single-sex groups of females, and the presence of males seemed not to affect the degree of synchrony between females. Sixty-six percent of vigilant acts were unique (performed when no other kangaroo was alert), and only about one unique vigilant act in every three induced a collective wave of vigilance. The proportions of vigilant acts that were unique were 60% for females but only 46% for males. However, the sexes differed little in the rates at which their unique vigilant acts were copied. This limited study shows that the differences in vigilance between male and female kangaroos had no discernible effect upon collective vigilance.",NA
