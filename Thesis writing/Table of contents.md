## Abstract
- Full thesis abstract: Briefly go into the theory, execution, results and discussion of the entire abstract.
- Use Baby-Werewolf-Silver Bullet
- Baby: Many species are negatively affected by urbanization and the increase in abundance of urbanized species.
- Werewolf: Modified use of social behaviors by urbanized species is understudied. These social behaviors may give certain species advantages over others, driving upwards the costs of competition and contributing to the loss of biodiversity.
- Silver Bullet: My study seeks to identify if and how urban crows forage differently in the presence of a sentinel, and in different environments.

## List of Definitions
	This is something I would like to do.
- Have set and explicit definitions for all the main concepts talked about in the thesis. Such as:
	- Sentinel behavior:
		- Layman's definition is a 'watchful animal' similar to human sentries
		- There are many slight variations of the definition of 'sentinel behavior', yet they all include some variation of an individual stationed in a prominent, exposed position that scans the surrounding areas and alerts other group-mates that are engaging in other activities.
		- The sentinel does not participate in these activities.
		- Bedneckoff proposed that coordination is the defining feature of sentinel behavior, since the occupation of a prominent, expose position and alarm signals can occur outside of sentinel behavior.
			- Unfortunately, and in line with Bednekoff's review, most articles found on sentinel behavior do not mention coordination as a defining feature (13 out of 81 articles in SR)
	- Multilevel Selection
		- Generally, multilevel selection theory is a theoretical framework that suggests that selection can occur at different levels of organization; from the genetic level to the group level and upwards.
		- As a mathematical "equation" and in the context of social behaviors, MLS can be described simply as 
			-  Selfish (S) > Altruist (A)
			- SSS < AAA
		- The reasoning for it is that at the individual level, a selfish individual will inevitably outcompete an altruist. However, a group of altruists will outcompete a group of selfish individuals, since the altruists will collaborate, compensate and not compete with one another, effectively increasing the group's fitness.
		- MLS synthesizes individual and kin selection theories and revives the previously shunned group selection theory to better explain how certain behaviors like social behaviors could be selected for
			- By themselves, each selection theory might explain a part of how social behaviors have evolved.
			- A somewhat debated topic among biologists.
		- This can explain how sentinel behavior has evolved, and somewhat reinforces Bednekoff's inclusion of coordination as the defining feature of sentinel behavior.
			- More sentinels in the group means a greater likelihood of an individual replacing a sentinel; meaning less time between sentinels (unsafe periods ↓), shorter sentinel bouts (non-sentinel periods ↑), and therefore a more successful group than one with fewer sentinels.
	- Bednekoff's model and assumptions
		- Based on Lima's foraging-vigilance tradeoff
			- The need to eat and the need to not be eaten are mutually exclusive needs that must be satiated for an individual to survive.
		- A system of stable cooperative (sentinel) behavior based on selfish individual state-dependent decisions
			- The individual decides to perform sentinel behavior regardless of the group, depending on their own (energetic) state.
		- Assumes the following:
			- Sentinel behavior is a low-cost activity performed by individuals with sufficient energetic reserves from foraging.
				- Goes back to the foraging-vigilance tradeoff
			- The benefits from sentinel behavior arise only from an increase in personal safety, not from protecting other group-members.
				- debatable, as empirical studies found that sentinel efforts differ among the sexes and dominance hierarchy.
				- The benefits from sentinel behavior could include information gathering about other groups or group-members
			- Safe refuges do not exist, therefore the sentinel's post is the safest place to be if the alternative is foraging without a sentinel
				- Empirical studies found that the sentinel most often was the first individual to spot sources of danger, and was often the first to take cover
				- Studies on meerkats found that guards (sentinels) did not suffer increased predation
	- The types of environment used (G. Env)
		- To make things simple, I decided to group together environments under generalized umbrella terms: green area and commercial areas.
		- Areas were identified using the St. Catharines and Niagara region zoning bylaws and maps. All commercial areas, regardless of subtype or size were grouped under "commercial areas", while all subtypes and sizes of green areas were grouped together.

## General Introduction
	This will act as the introduction to the entire thesis and will outline the narrative to be covered. I will cover the background that justifies the need for this research, identify the B-W-SB, my hypotheses and predictions, and finally what steps I took.

### 1.1 Urbanization
- Define urbanization & what it entails. (A global analysis of the impacts of urbanization on bird and plant diversity reveals key anthropogenic drivers)
	- Urbanization, contrary to how most people would define it, is the gradual shift in human population to living in urban areas. As a consequence, the urban sprawl has caused more and more undeveloped land to be transformed, resulting in a loss of habitats for many species, habitat fragmentation, and increased anthropogenic disturbances.
- Describe effects of urbanization on species, diversity.
	- A myriad of researchers have found that the increase in urbanization over the last century is directly associated with a sharp decrease in species biodiversity, especially around cities.
	- The alteration of a species' territory, be it the removal, alteration or fragmentation of its habitat, will inevitably affect the species' success, as there could be fewer resources, a smaller home range or increased competition for those resources.
		- Decreased carrying capacity in those areas as the territory gets smaller
		- Fewer 'natural' resources means increased inter- and intra-specific competition
		- Fewer shelter could result in competition and therefore an increase in mortality, especially if breeding and (nesting, but more general) spaces are limited and competed for.
	- Increased anthropogenic disturbances results in increased stress, and therefore greater mortality
		- noise
		- people
		- cars
		- **PEST CONTROL**
	- The introduction of non-native species usually results in native species being outcompeted, depredated, etc.
		- The increased presence of rats, cats, squirrels, etc, will inevitably affect a species' survival if they are not adapted to living in their proximity.
			- Cats are responsible for a great percentage of extinctions worldwide
		- These introduced species are often adapted for city living, and therefore will "push out" other species fighting for the same resources
		- Hyperpredation could also contribute to the loss of species diversity after the introduction of non-native species
		- Likewise, introduced species could also depredate prey species, leading to the potential destabilization of an ecosystem.
- Examples of negative effects on species using literature.

### 1.2 Urbanized Species
- Define synanthropy/urbanization of a species.
	- The urbanization of a species can be simply explained as a species adapting to live in and/or around a city.
	- Behavioral adaptations such as a change in diet or foraging behavior, changes in nesting behavior, increased tolerance of human proximity, etc
	- These adaptations facilitate life in urban areas.
- Describe traits that make a species better adapted to urban areas/more prone to urbanization.
	- Generalist species will be more prone to urbanization, as they are more flexible with their resource use, and can tolerate the loss of some resources, or can adapt to use novel or previously underused resources.
	- Specialist species, who have adapted to specific resources will be highly affected by the loss or alteration that resource, and is at greatest risk.
	- An adaptable, omnivorous diet is probably one of the greatest factors, as a specialist species that is entirely reliant on the use of a specific food-source will not be able to adapt if that resource is quickly depleted.
	- Behavioral flexibility and adaptability are key traits that will directly affect a species' survival
- Give examples of urbanized species, and provide examples where the abundance increases following urbanization (Animal behavior in urban ecosystems: Modifications due to human-induced stress)
	- Raccoons, rats, squirrels, pigeons are classic examples of urbanized species.
		- Pigeons have adapted from a cliff/rock face dwelling species to species that will inhabit any nook or crevice in a city's infrastructure.
		- Trash pandas, a slang for raccoons, have adapted their diet to raid trash cans and will find shelter under human-made structures like sheds and decks
		- Rats are probably most associated with the presence of humans, as their introduction has historically followed human settlement.
	- All urbanized species will be reliant on some facet of urbanized life, and their abundance will be directly related to the proximity to human settlements.
- Describe effects of urbanized species on non-urbanized species
	- Competition for the same resources
		- Urbanized species can outcompete native species for resources such as shelter or food sources
	- Difference in fitness
		- By virtue of being adapted to living in urban areas, urbanized species will generally be more fit in urban areas than non-adapted species.
	- Contribution to loss of biodiversity
		- As a result, the presence and abundance of urbanized species, especially introduced ones, will contribute to the loss of native species diversity

### 1.3 American Crows
- Introduce the model species
	- American crows can be found throughout most north American cities
	- A highly intelligent corvid that has been found to have incredible problem-solving capabilities
	- Generalists, capable of using diverse food sources, shelters
	- Highly social species, cooperative breeders that will flock together in large groups during the non-breeding season, and small, familial groups during the breeding season.
		- Very large roosts, especially in the later hours of the evening, can have hundreds of individuals
		- The small nuclear groups during the breeding season usually include the two parents and last year's (immature) offspring (helpers). The helpers will assist the parents with the care of young, including foraging for food and vigilance
 - Provide evidence to suspect they are urbanized
	 - Adaptations
		 - Use of anthropogenic food sources such as trash cans and litter
			 - their intelligence allows them to figure out certain patterns in human life, such as when garbage removal occurs (anecdotal)
		 - Tolerance of humans and vehicles
	 - Increase in abundance
		 - American crow abundance has increased substantially over the last decades, and is linked with the increase in urbanization and the size of cities.
			 - The larger the city, the greater the abundance
- Describe effects on other species (if present & researched)
	- Oft believed to contribute to the loss of biodiversity through (egg) predation and competition for resources
	- Especially exacerbated by the presence of other urbanized species such as seagulls
- Explicitly state why American crows are a good model species for research in urbanized species
- Introduce the use of social behavior in American crows
	- Why are social behaviors important?
		- Social behaviors help with tradeoffs such as the foraging-vigilance tradeoff (Lima).
			- You cannot forage and be vigilant at the same time (mutually exclusive behaviors), yet both are needed to survive
			- Social behaviors can assist with this tradeoff, since other individuals in the group can also look out for predators
				- many eyes
			- Large groups can also reduce the predation pressure on individuals through dilution
				- Prey dilution
			- Social behaviors can permit individuals to forage more effectively while being adequately protected from predators
		- Sociality can also help (bird) species deal with anthropogenic disturbances and facilitate their survival in cities 
			- (Sociality enhances birds’ capacity to deal with anthropogenic ecosystems)
		- Social behaviors can also affect a species' survival by reducing offspring mortality
			- Facilitates learning behaviors
			- Decreased nestling mortality though increased vigilance, especially in cooperatively breeding species
	- Why is research in this topic important?
		- By understanding what can affect social behaviors, we may be able to better understand the mechanisms underlying the evolution and maintenance of social behaviors, as well as how social behaviors could respond to rapidly changing environments (i.e. rapid changes in environment caused by humans)
	- Examples of social behaviors found in American crows
		- Cooperative breeding
			- Helpers helping parents with parental care, foraging and vigilance
		- Group Foraging
			- Foraging in large groups to benefit from the vigilance provided by other foraging conspecifics
		- Sentinel Behavior
			- An individual providing continuous vigilance over group-mates from a prominent, exposed position

### 1.4 Sentinel Behavior
- Define sentinel behavior
	- An individual adopts a prominently exposed position to watch over other group members that are engaged in other activities, including but not limited to foraging behavior
- Explain how sentinel behavior affects the individuals
	- Foragers gain reduced need for vigilance
		- Ties back to Lima's foraging-vigilance tradeoff
		- If one individual is constantly vigilant, then the other individuals can forage more efficiently as they require less individual vigilance (compensated by the sentinel's vigilance)
	- Sentinel loses foraging opportunities
		- The lost-opportunity cost to sentinels can be great, yet Bednekoff's selfish state-dependent model suggests that sentinels possess sufficient energetic reserves to perform sentinel behavior, and the cost of losing foraging opportunities can be recovered when another individual sentinels
	- Sentinel behavior is not free, but is a low-cost activity to the sentinel, while providing significant benefits to the other group members
- Bednekoff's stipulation on coordination
	- Key aspect to sentinel behavior is its coordination
		- adopting a prominent position and alerting group members can be non-sentinel behavior
		- The coordination of sentinels ensures the optimal coverage of group members and is considered a defining trait of sentinel behavior
	- Costly, but reduces gaps in coverage
		- Any kind of coordination is costly
	- Not many articles describe coordination when researching sentinel systems
- Sentinel behavior and urbanization
	- Groups with more sentinels will outperform groups with fewer sentinels.
		- Introduction to multilevel selection theory
		- Assuming sentinel behavior is altruistic, then sentinels are outperformed by non-sentinels. However, groups with sentinels outperform groups without sentinels
	- There are many factors that could provoke the need for, or reduce the costs of sentinel behavior in urban areas
		- Increased presence, predictability and caloric content of anthropogenic food sources
			- Therefore individuals have greater energetic reserves, and are more inclined to perform sentinel behavior
			- The higher caloric content of anthropogenic foods also suggests a faster recovery of the lost-opportunity costs to the sentinel
		- Increased sources of threat and unpredictability
			- Unpredictability increases risk, more risk = more need to be vigilant in case there is a danger
			- Urbanization also introduces urbanized predators that may be more abundant in urban areas, such as cats, dogs, and urban wildlife such as urbanized raptors
			- Most humans may not harass, but some might
				- increased tolerance to humans, but neophobia
				- neophobia leads to the need to be aware of novel stimuli that may be dangerous
			- Some species, including American crows, are seen as pests, and therefore are harassed or killed
				- Interestingly, crows have shown to nest in cities where the discharge of firearms is prohibited
		- More perches available to sentinels
			- Light posts, trees, buildings, fences, etc
			- Sentinel perches closer to foraging patches makes sentinel behavior more effective
	- There are many factors that could make sentinel behavior ineffective in urban areas
		- Increased anthropogenic noise
			- Makes sentinel's signals more difficult to hear, leading to ineffective sentinel behavior.
		- Decreased visibility and shorter lines of sight
			- A more heterogenic environment can result in a busier sightline, therefore making the detection of potential sources of threat more difficult, and closer to the foraging group
			- Shorter lines of sight results in threats being detected closer to the foraging group, meaning less time between threat detection and the danger affecting the foragers.

### Hypotheses and predictions
- I hypothesize that the use of social foraging and sentinel behavior will be affected by the environment in which the group forages in.
- I predict that urban (commercial) areas will require more coverage, and therefore will result in greater frequency of sentinel behavior.
- I also predict that urban (commercial) areas will still trigger an increase in vigilance behavior in foragers
	- Urban areas are noisier, making the signals from the sentinel harder to understand/hear
		- Sentinel is closer and therefore less time before threat arrives
		- Alarm signal from sentinel is "muddy" making them less reliable
	- Shorter lines of sight could result in the sentinel being less effective, and therefore the foragers need to be more vigilant than in green areas

## Chapter 2: Identifying sources of variation in sentinel participation and effort
	To better understand how the propensity of an individual to participate in sentinel behavior can be modified, I conducted a scoping review to determine which factors have been identified by previous research.

### 2.1 Introduction
	Introduce the ways in which sentinel behavior can be altered, which factors have been identified and how they affect sentinel behavior. Introduction here serves as a literature review, with the methods, results and discussion describing the scoping review and the meta-analysis.
- Redefine sentinel behavior
	- Perched area, exposed
	- Sentinel loses foraging opportunities
	- Foragers gain from constant vigilance from sentinel
	- Coordination as defining feature
	- Examples in other species
- Explain how sentinel behavior can be altered
	- Sentinel initiation or propensity to participate in sentinel behavior
	- Sentinel effort or how long and how early a sentinel goes up
- Sex
	- Males generally sentinel more, and for longer than females.
	- Could be explained by a different need/use of energy
		- Males could need to defend territory or mates, therefore sentinel behavior is both an antipredator and a mate/nest guarding behavior
		- Females need to spend more time on the nest during reproductive periods. More energy lost to reproduction when making eggs.
- Dominance
	- Dominant individuals could be better foragers, or lose less foraging opportunities to theft
	- More dominant individual tend to be larger than subordinates
- Predation Risk
	- Increased predation risk inherently leads to increased need for vigilance, and therefore an increased presence of threat leads to an increased frequency of sentinel behavior
- Group size
	- As group size increases, then an individual's contribution to the group's total sentinel effort is diluted by the presence of other sentinels.
		- More sentinels = less costly behavior for the individual
		- Relative fitness gains increased
- Satiation
	- Presence of more food, more nutritious or caloric foods leads to earlier and longer sentinel bouts.
		- Energetic threshold met faster
		- Costs of lost foraging opportunities minimized
- Bednekoff's model
	- Stable selfish individual state-dependent decisions
	- Based on Lima's foraging-vigilance tradeoff
	- Three main assumptions
		- Sentinel behavior is a low-cost activity performed by individuals that have sufficient energetic reserves from foraging.
		- Benefits of sentinel behavior arise only from an increase in personal safety, not from protecting other group members
		- Safe refuges do not exist, therefore the sentinel's post is the safest place to be if the alternative is foraging without a sentinel
	- Can explain how the other factors affect sentinel behavior, if sentinel behavior is entirely dependent on the energetic state of the individual.
	- Can be determined in empirical studies using the body mass/energetic reserves of an individual
- Objective statement
	- I seek to determine which factors have the most impact on the sentinel decision-making of terrestrial social species.
	- To accomplish this endeavor, I performed a scoping review and meta-analysis of the currently available literature.
- Hypothesis and predictions
	- I hypothesize that sentinel decision-making will be significantly affected by sex, dominance, group size and predation risk.
		- Males > Females
		- Dominant > Subordinate
		- Big group < Small group
		- Riskier > Safer

### 2.4 Discussion
- Explain the results you've collected by tying them into the concepts outlined in the introduction section of the chapter
- Explicitly mention how hard it is to measure body mass changes in many species
- Cohesively explain all facets of sentinel decision-making.

### 2.4.1 Conclusion
- Cohesively outline the factors identified in the review
- Describe how these factors could be altered or modified in urban areas.
- Tie in the need to understand social behaviors in urban areas, as social species could compete more effectively against solitary species for the same resources.

### 2.5 Linking statement
	How does the literature review connect with the empirical study?

- Quickly explain that sentinel behavior is not set in stone, and can be affected by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as sex, dominance, and energetic reserves. Then, link to how urbanization can alter these factors and how sentinel behavior may then be affected. Lastly, state the importance of studying the modified use of sentinel behavior in urban areas.
	- An individual's inclination to participate in sentinel behavior can be affected by a number of factors, from sex to energetic reserves, and their effects can greatly change an individual's contribution to a group's total sentinel effort.
	- While intrinsic factors, such as sex, remain constant throughout an individual's life, a number of extrinsic factors can greatly affect sentinel efforts. Many of these factors are directly linked with an individual's perception of their environment.
	- In a world where humanity is rapidly changing vast swathes of land for human use, these extrinsic factors may be applying completely different pressures than in a natural environment.
	- Urbanization comes with a number of changes, such as the increased proximity to humans and their pets, their vehicles and homes, the increased abundance and predictability of high-calorie anthropogenic foods, and the introduction of non-native species that could be perceived as threats; as a result, urbanization has the potential to impact the sentinel efforts of urban-dwelling species.
	- If Bednekoff's model holds true, then the increased presence of anthropogenic foods could increase the energetic reserves in all group-members, making sentinel behavior a very low-cost activity. The availability of anthropogenic foods can compensate for the energy spent being sentinel.
	- This could make sentinel behavior a low-cost, high-benefit behavior that could improve the fitness of species that perform sentinel behavior in urban settings.
	- Urbanized social species capable of performing sentinel behavior can therefore have an advantage over less social or solitary urbanized species. Furthermore, this advantage can give urbanized social species an additional edge over native, non-urbanized species that will be competing for the same resources.
	- Moreover, environmental factors could also make sentinel behavior less effective in an urban setting, changing the foraging individual's reliance on the sentinel for antipredator vigilance. For example, anthropogenic noise could make information transfer from sentinel to forager more difficult. Foragers may then increase their own vigilance to compensate for the decreased fidelity of sentinel alarm signals.
	- It is therefore important to study the effects of urbanization at a social level as well as at the individual level, as small changes in behavior at the individual level could snowball into considerable advantages at the group scale, neatly fitting into the multilevel selection theory.
	- Conversely, sentinel behavior could be less effective or less needed in urban areas. Over time, this could result in the behavior being observed less in urbanized species. Such results could reveal interesting insights into the mechanisms underlying the evolution of social behaviors.

## Chapter 3: Determining the effects of the environment on sentinel behavior and social foraging behavior
	This is the empirical study I performed in the summer of 2022. I looked at the behavior of foragers in different environments and in the presence of a sentinel.

### 3.1 Introduction
	This is where I will be introducing the core concepts used in the empirical study
	Think of the intro as
	- what is the problem
	- Why is it a problem
	- What is being done about the problem
	- What’s the knowledge gap
	- Study species
	- Objectives

#### 3.1.1 Sentinel behavior
- Re-describe sentinel behavior
- Explain the purpose of sentinel behavior
	- Vigilance-Foraging tradeoff
	- Increased vigilance for foragers, cost to sentinel
	- An example of social behavior
- Explain (quickly) how sentinel could be affected by external factors
	- Namely risk and presence of food
		- Predictability of risk!
	- Ambient noise
	- Lines of sight
- Explain how an urban environment could affect sentinel behavior
	- Greater access to and predictability of food sources
	- Urbanized predators, humans, vehicles, animals, etc
	- More ambient noise
		- Make sentinel harder to hear, less reliable
		- Shorter lines of sight (more cluttered vision)

#### Modified social behaviors in urban areas
- Enter werewolf
	- If urban areas can affect the propensity and efficacy of sentinels, then foragers may have altered behaviors to account for these changes.
	- These modified behaviors could maintain the increase the fitness of these individuals gained from performing social behaviors.
	- Modified social behaviors could contribute to the increased fitness and ability of social synurbic species to compete with other species living alongside them
- Social synurbic species could be foraging with increased protection and have increased foraging efficiency in the presence of a sentinel, even if the sentinel is less reliable in urban areas than in greener areas.
- Yet, these changes of social foraging behavior in different environments are understudied
	- Silver bullet!
	- Introduce model species: The American crow

#### 3.1.2 Hypotheses


### 3.2 Methods
	This will be split into a number of separate sections, mainly:
	- Site selection
	- Experimental design
	- Behavioral coding
	- Additional measurements
	- Statistical analysis

#### 3.2.1 Site selection
- St. Catharines and Niagara region in the south of Ontario
- Summer (June-Sept) to avoid changes in behavior caused by seasonality 
- Crowkemon GO
	- Citizen science initiative started in January 2022
	- Collected crow sightings in the area
	- Areas of high crow density selected as potential sites
- Recurrent site selection
	- Frequently frequented potential test sites
	- Left food and used a crow caller to attract crows and associate the location with the presence of food
	- Three sites selected initially for recurrent sampling (though only one generated results)
- Opportunistic sampling
	- Bike/drive across the city to potential sites or to spotted crows

#### 3.2.2 Experimental design
- Supplemental feeding/baiting + observation (opportunistic)
- 2-3 hours following sunrise
- Weather dependent (!Rain/Storm)
- Camera set up >15m away, used Nikon AF-P NIKKOR 70-300mm (f/4.5-5.6E ED VR) lens 
- Camera pointed at bait/foraging crows
- Presence of sentinel (heard or spotted) announced verbally during recording.

##### 3.2.2.1 Recurrent sampling
- Visibly dropped food (mainly cheezits) in front of crows
	- If no crows present, used a crow caller for 20 mins (1 per min for 5 mins, no call for 5 mins, then repeat)
- Retreated to camera, recorded up to 20 mins
- Trial concluded 5 mins after departure of crows
- Remained on site 10 mins after departure

##### 3.2.2.2 Opportunistic sampling
- When crows were spotted foraging, camera was set up >15m away and recorded up to 20 mins
- When crows were not spotted, same methods as recurrent sampling were applied
	- NO CROW CALLER

#### 3.2.3 Behavioral coding
- Describe behaviors used
	- Use the table & pictograms
	- Head Up, Head Down, Moving
	- Depended on position of head and movement
	- Estimate vigilance of individual
- Behaviors coded for every individual seen foraging
- Coded in BORIS using an XBOX controller and AntiMICRO
- Also coded number and type of disturbances, aggression towards conspecific or other species, peck rate and foraging group size (excludes group members not on the ground)
	- Disturbance: riskiness of environment
	- Aggression: competition
	- Peck rate: foraging effort
- Measurements taken
	- Bout duration
	- Proportion of time allocated to each behavior
	- Peck rate
	- Frequency of disturbances

#### 3.2.3 Additional measurements
- In addition to the behavioral measurements, we measured some other variables to better quantify the environment
	- - Generalized environment type
		- Used zoning maps to get environment type, then generalized to either commercial or green areas
	- Distance of bait to nearest refuge
		- Refuge defined as elevated position away from bait
	- Refuge type
		- e.g. fence, tree, bench, etc
	- Weather
	- Temperature
	- GPS coordinates
	
- Measurements used in statistical analyses

#### 3.2.4 Statistical analyses

### 3.4 Discussion
	Think of the discussion as:
	-  What’s wrong with what is being done about the problem
	- Why do we care about fixing that problem
	- What did your results find and How do your results fix the problem
	- Implications for the field
	- Future directions
	- Conclusions (a really long abstract but skip most of the intro)
#### 3.4.1 Proportion of time allocated to each behavior
- Proportion data would show overall changes in vigilance, with increased proportion of vigilance indicating increased perception of risk. If the proportion of time allocated to each behavior is depedent on the frequency of disturbances (risk) then this would support the risk allocation hypothesis
	- Describe effects observations
		- No effects of sentinel could be that the sentinel maintains the required vigilance of the group in the absence of an immediate threat
		- No effects of environment could be that crows forage similarly in both environments, therefore
		- DISTURBANCE DATA!!!
	- Describe implications
		- If there are no differences in proportion, then the individuals could be allocating similar amounts of time/effort into each behavior, but changing the frequency and duration of their bouts.
		- Could be that the allocation of time to each behavior is relatively fixed, supporting the hypothesis that minor modifications in the balance between vigilance and foraging could be done in the frequency and duration of bouts of each behavior.

#### 3.4.2 Peck rate
- Peck rate reflects the foraging effort of an individual. More pecks/unit time could mean more intense foraging, either by a sense of urgency, or increased bait. This could fall in line with the risk allocation hypothesis, where in high-risk environments, individuals may decide to still forage actively in the presence of these threats to satiate their energetic needs. Alternatively, individuals could forage more intensely when food is concentrated in a dense patch (i.e. Bait). If that is true, then the more intense peck rate is explained that way.
	- Describe effects observation
		- No effects detected in the current LMM. Unsure how to explain yet, as I will need to re-analyse the data using the new dataset
		- DISTURBANCE DATA!!!
	- Describe implications
		- If the presence of a sentinel does not affect the peck rate, then it could be that when a sentinel is not present (not needed), then the foragers are foraging optimally. If increased vigilance is needed, then a sentinel can allow the foragers to continue foraging optimally
		- If frequency of disturbance is significant, then the risk allocation hypothesis could be supported depending on the direction of the effect. Both direction could support the risk allocation hypothesis
			- Increased could be a result of a "safe period" in which crows have to forage as intensively as possible in case the threat returns
			- Decreased could be a result of not needing to take unecessary risks. If a threat is present, then it could be better to move to a less risky environment in which to forage in.
		- If bait has an effect, then the concentration of food could result in more effective foraging, with less time required to find and manipulate food.
		- If environment has no effect, then they could be foraging similarly in either environment. Find a better explanation!

#### 3.4.3 Bout Duration
- Individuals could be modifying the frequency and duration of their behaviors to better respond to the perception of their environment. 
	- If vigilance bout duration is increased, it could be a result of caution before fleeing, just as much as it could be looking at other individuals or potential sources of food. If decreased but more frequent, it could imply that crows require more constant vigilance (as opposed to longer, but less frequent) between bouts of non-vigilance.
	- If foraging bout duration is increased, then the individual could perceive the environment as less risky, and therefore could be allocating more energy into foraging. If foraging bouts are decreased in duration, but more frequent, this could be a symptom of the need for increased vigilance, with the least amount of continuous time spent being non-vigilant.
	- If movement bout duration is increased. Then crows could be searching for food across a larger area. This is expected to be affected by the presence of bait.
- This could be the main source of fine modifications to the vigilance-foraging tradeoff.
	- Describe effects observed
		- Crows spend significantly less time with their head’s up than down. 
		- Crows spend significantly less time moving than with their heads down. 
		- The duration of behaviors decreases significantly in the absence of a sentinel. 
		- The duration of behaviors decreases significantly in Commercial areas. 
		- The duration of behaviors decreases significantly in baited sites.
		- There was an interaction between the presence of a sentinel and the generalized environment. (decreased duration)
	- Describe implications
		- Behaviors
			- It could be that vigilance takes less time to be "effective", and less time to perform than head down, where crows could be stacking food to transport away, or breaking up larger chunks. 
			- Likewise, when crows can either move by hopping, walking or flying, then movement can be performed faster than it would take to manipulate food.
				- This also includes the short durations when a crow flies away and out of frame. Could be skewed towards shorter behaviors. 
				- Should I only include ground movement (i.e. walking/hopping)?
			- Head down is the behavior R used to compare the other behaviors to.
		- Sentinel
			- The presence of a sentinel implies the need for a sentinel, therefore the presence of risk to which sentinels can better respond to. That being said, following the assumptions of Bednekoff's model, foraging without a sentinel is more risky than foraging without a sentinel when no threats have been detected (yet). Therefore it is expected to see behaviors increase in duration when a sentinel is present (less need for "constant" vigilance offered by frequent HU/HD)
		- Commercial areas
			- Commercial areas are more busy, unpredictable and therefore require increased consistency of antipredator behavior, even when a sentinel is present. 
			- DISTURBANCE DATA!!! Are disturbances more frequent in commercial areas?
		- Baited sites
			- If food is concentrated in a given area, then it may be more effective to decrease behavior durations (specifically head down, which may shift the behaviors downward)
			- Consider running the interaction between behavior and bout to see if certain behaviors interact more than others. 
				- Prediction: Head Down X Bait significant
		- Interaction between Green areas and the presence of a sentinel decreased the duration of bouts
			- I have no idea how to explain this.
			- Previous logic suggests shorter duration + higher frequency = greater need for vigilance & green areas being "safer" (longer lines of sight therefore more effective vigilance, fewer disturbances, more predictable environments. )

## Appendix
	This is where I will be appending the additional figures, tables, and resources that can provide additional information, but that would be distracting, unecessary or would derail the narrative of the thesis. E.g ROSES flowchart, group size plot, information about Crowkemon Go.
