## Abstract
- Full thesis abstract: Briefly go into the theory, execution, results and discussion of the entire abstract.
- Use Baby-Werewolf-Silver Bullet
- Baby: Many species are negatively affected by urbanization and the increase in abundance of urbanized species.
- Werewolf: Modified use of social behaviors by urbanized species is understudied. These social behaviors may give certain species advantages over others, driving upwards the costs of competition and contributing to the loss of biodiversity.
- Silver Bullet: My study seeks to identify if and how urban crows forage differently in the presence of a sentinel, and in different environments.

## General Introduction
	This will act as the introduction to the entire thesis and will outline the narrative to be covered. I will cover the background that justifies the need for this research, identify the B-W-SB, my hypotheses and predictions, and finally what steps I took.

### 1.1 Urbanization
- Define urbanization & what it entails.
- Describe effects of urbanization on species, diversity.
- Examples of negative effects on species using literature.

### 1.2 Urbanized Species
- Define synanthropy/urbanization of a species.
- Describe traits that make a species better adapted to urban areas/more prone to urbanization.
- Give examples of urbanized species, and provide examples where the abundance increases following urbanization
- Describe effects of urbanized species on non-urbanized species
	- Competition for the same resources
	- Difference in fitness
	- Contribution to loss of biodiversity

### 1.3 American Crows
- Introduce the model species
 - Provide evidence to suspect they are urbanized
	 - Adaptations
	 - Increase in abundance
- Describe effects on other species (if present & researched)
- Explicitly state why American crows are a good model species for research in urbanized species
- Introduce the use of social behavior in American crows
	- Why are social behaviors important?
	- Why is research in this topic important?
	- Examples of social behaviors found in American crows
		- Cooperative breeding
		- Group Foraging
		- Sentinel Behavior

### 1.4 Sentinel Behavior
- Define sentinel behavior
- Explain how sentinel behavior affects the individuals
	- Foragers gain reduced need for vigilance
	- Sentinel loses foraging opportunities
- Bednekoff's stipulation on coordination
	- Key aspect to sentinel behavior is its coordination
	- Costly, but reduces gaps in coverage
	- Not many articles describe coordination when researching sentinel systems
- Sentinel behavior and urbanization
	- Urbanization could affect sentinel behavior, and groups with more sentinels will outperform groups with fewer sentinels.
		- Introduction to multilevel selection theory
		- Assuming sentinel behavior is altruistic, then sentinels are outperformed by nonsentinels. However, groups with sentinels outperform groups without sentinels.
	- There are many factors that could provoke the need for, or reduce the costs of sentinel behavior in urban areas
		- Increased presence, predictability and caloric content of anthropogenic food sources
		- Increased sources of threat and unpredictability
		- More perches available to sentinels
	- There are many factors that could make sentinel behavior ineffective in urban areas
		- Increased anthropogenic noise
		- Decreased visibility and shorter lines of sight

### Hypotheses and predictions
- I hypothesize that the use of social foraging and sentinel behavior will be affected by the environment in which the group forages in.
- I predict that urban (commercial) areas will require more coverage, and therefore will result in greater frequency of sentinel behavior.
- I also predict that urban (commercial) areas will still trigger an increase in vigilance behavior in foragers
	- Urban areas are noisier, making the signals from the sentinel harder to understand/hear
		- Sentinel is closer and therefore less time before threat arrives
		- Alarm signal from sentinel is "muddy" making them less reliable

## Chapter 2: Identifying sources of variation in sentinel participation and effort
	To better understand how the propensity of an individual to participate in sentinel behavior can be modified, I conducted a scoping review to determine which factors have been identified by previous research.

### 2.1 Introduction
	Introduce the ways in which sentinel behavior can be altered, which factors have been identified and how they affect sentinel behavior. Introduction here serves as a literature review, with the methods, results and discussion describing the scoping review and the meta-analysis.
- Redefine sentinel behavior
	- Perched area, exposed
	- Sentinel loses foraging opportunities
	- Foragers gain from constant vigilance from sentinel
	- Coordination as defining feature
	- Examples in other species
- Explain how sentinel behavior can be altered
	- Sentinel initiation or propensity to participate in sentinel behavior
	- Sentinel effort or how long and how early a sentinel goes up
- Sex
	- Males generally sentinel more, and for longer than females.
	- Could be explained by a different need/use of energy
		- Males could need to defend territory or mates, therefore sentinel behavior is both an antipredator and a mate/nest guarding behavior
		- Females need to spend more time on the nest during reproductive periods. More energy lost to reproduction when making eggs.
- Dominance
	- Dominant individuals could be better foragers, or lose less foraging opportunities to theft
	- More dominant individual tend to be larger than subordinates
- Predation Risk
	- Increased predation risk inherently leads to increased need for vigilance, and therefore an increased presence of threat leads to an increased frequency of sentinel behavior
- Group size
	- As group size increases, then an individual's contribution to the group's total sentinel effort is diluted by the presence of other sentinels.
		- More sentinels = less costly behavior for the individual
		- Relative fitness gains increased
- Satiation
	- Presence of more food, more nutritious or caloric foods leads to earlier and longer sentinel bouts.
		- Energetic threshold met faster
		- Costs of lost foraging opportunities minimized
- Bednekoff's model
	- Stable selfish individual state-dependent decisions
	- Based on Lima's foraging-vigilance tradeoff
	- Three main assumptions
		- Sentinel behavior is a low-cost activity performed by individuals that have sufficient energetic reserves from foraging.
		- Benefits of sentinel behavior arise only from an increase in personal safety, not from protecting other group members
		- Safe refuges do not exist, therefore the sentinel's post is the safest place to be if the alternative is foraging without a sentinel
	- Can explain how the other factors affect sentinel behavior, if sentinel behavior is entirely dependent on the energetic state of the individual.
	- Can be determined in empirical studies using the body mass/energetic reserves of an individual
- Objective statement
	- I seek to determine which factors have the most impact on the sentinel decision-making of terrestrial social species.
	- To accomplish this endeavor, I performed a scoping review and meta-analysis of the currently available literature.
- Hypothesis and predictions
	- I hypothesize that sentinel decision-making will be significantly affected by sex, dominance, group size and predation risk.
		- Males > Females
		- Dominant > Subordinate
		- Big group < Small group
		- Riskier > Safer

- Describe how these factors could be altered or modified in urban areas.
- Tie in the need to understand social behaviors in urban areas, as social species could compete more effectively against solitary species for the same resources.

## Chapter 3: Determining the effects of the environment on sentinel behavior and social foraging behavior
	This is the empirical study I performed in the summer of 2022. I looked at the behavior of foragers in different environments and in the presence of a sentinel.

### 3.1 Introduction
	This is where I will be introducing the core concepts used in the empirical study

#### 3.1.1 Sentinel behavior
- Re-describe sentinel behavior
- Explain the purpose of sentinel behavior
	- Vigilance-Foraging tradeoff
	- Increased vigilance for foragers, cost to sentinel
	- An example of social behavior
- Explain (quickly) how sentinel could be affected by external factors
	- Namely risk and presence of food
		- Predictability of risk!
	- Ambient noise
	- Lines of sight
- Explain how an urban environment could affect sentinel behavior
	- Greater access to and predictability of food sources
	- Urbanized predators, humans, vehicles, animals, etc
	- More ambient noise
		- Make sentinel harder to hear, less reliable
		- Shorter lines of sight (more cluttered vision)

#### Modified social behaviors in urban areas
- Enter werewolf
	- If urban areas can affect the propensity and efficacy of sentinels, then foragers may have altered behaviors to account for these changes.
	- These modified behaviors could maintain the increase the fitness of these individuals gained from performing social behaviors.
	- Modified social behaviors could contribute to the increased fitness and ability of social synurbic species to compete with other species living alongside them
- Social synurbic species could be foraging with increased protection and have increased foraging efficiency in the presence of a sentinel, even if the sentinel is less reliable in urban areas than in greener areas.
- Yet, these changes of social foraging behavior in different environments are understudied
	- Silver bullet!
	- Introduce model species: The American crow

#### 3.1.2 Hypotheses


### 3.2 Methods
	This will be split into a number of separate sections, mainly:
	- Site selection
	- Experimental design
	- Behavioral coding
	- Additional measurements
	- Statistical analysis

#### 3.2.1 Site selection
- St. Catharines and Niagara region in the south of Ontario
- Summer (June-Sept) to avoid changes in behavior caused by seasonality 
- Crowkemon GO
	- Citizen science initiative started in January 2022
	- Collected crow sightings in the area
	- Areas of high crow density selected as potential sites
- Recurrent site selection
	- Frequently frequented potential test sites
	- Left food and used a crow caller to attract crows and associate the location with the presence of food
	- Three sites selected initially for recurrent sampling (though only one generated results)
- Opportunistic sampling
	- Bike/drive across the city to potential sites or to spotted crows

#### 3.2.2 Experimental design
- Supplemental feeding/baiting + observation
- 2-3 hours following sunrise, 2-3 hours before sunset
- Weather dependent (!Rain/Storm)
- Camera set up >15m away, used Nikon AF-P NIKKOR 70-300mm (f/4.5-5.6E ED VR) lens 
- Camera pointed at bait/foraging crows
- Presence of sentinel (heard or spotted) announced verbally during recording.

##### 3.2.2.1 Recurrent sampling
- Visibly dropped food (mainly cheezits) in front of crows
	- If no crows present, used a crow caller for 20 mins (1 per min for 5 mins, no call for 5 mins, then repeat)
- Retreated to camera, recorded up to 20 mins
- Trial concluded 5 mins after departure of crows
- Remained on site 10 mins after departure

##### 3.2.2.2 Opportunistic sampling
- When crows were spotted foraging, camera was set up >15m away and recorded up to 20 mins
- When crows were not spotted, same methods as recurrent sampling were applied
	- NO CROW CALLER

#### 3.2.3 Behavioral coding
- Describe behaviors used
	- Use the table & pictograms
	- Head Up, Head Down, Moving
	- Depended on position of head and movement
	- Estimate vigilance of individual
- Behaviors coded for every individual seen foraging
- Coded in BORIS using an XBOX controller and AntiMICRO
- Also coded number and type of disturbances, aggression towards conspecific or other species, peck rate and foraging group size (excludes group members not on the ground)
	- Disturbance: riskiness of environment
	- Aggression: competition
	- Peck rate: foraging effort
- Measurements taken
	- Bout duration
	- Proportion of time allocated to each behavior
	- Peck rate
	- Frequency of disturbances

#### 3.2.3 Additional measurements
- In addition to the behavioral measurements, we measured some other variables to better quanlify the environment
	- - Generalized environment type
		- Used zoning maps to get environment type, then generalized to either commercial or green areas
	- Distance of bait to nearest refuge
		- Refuge defined as elevated position away from bait
	- Refuge type
		- e.g. fence, tree, bench, etc
	- Weather
	- Temperature
	- GPS coordinates
	
- Measurements used in statistical analyses

#### 3.2.4 Statistical analyses
- All stats performed in R 4.2.3
- LMM <- Robust LMM using the "robustlmm" package
	- On proportion data
	- On bout duration
	- On peck rate
- PCA <- either BaseR or the packages mentioned [here](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pca-analysis-r)
	- On likelihood of sentinel being present
	- On proportion data
	- On peck rate
- Pathway analysis <- Behatrix
	- Shows likelihood of one behavior following another
	- Exported behavioral sequences from BORIS
	- Removed sequences shorter than 2 behaviors
	- "Out of Frame" = cut the sequence and start a new sequence.

### 3.3 Results
	AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS! PCA and Pathway analyses not performed (yet)

#### 3.3.1 Likelihood of a sentinel being present
	Not performed yet

#### 3.3.2 Proportion data
- Describe the results of the proportion data
	- No significant effects on proportion detected in the LMM
	- PCA

#### 3.3.3 Peck rate
- Describe the result of the peck rate data
	- No effects detected on peck rate in LMM
	- PCA

#### 3.3.4 Bout duration
- Describe the results of the bout duration data
	- LMM
		- Crows spend significantly less time with their head’s up than down. 
		- Crows spend significantly less time moving than with their heads down.
		- The duration of behaviors decreases significantly in the absence of a sentinel.
		- The duration of behaviors decreases significantly in Commercial areas.
		- The duration of behaviors decreases significantly in baited sites. 
		- There was an interaction between the presence of a sentinel and the generalized environment.

#### 3.3.5 Pathway analyses
	Not performed yet

### 3.4 Discussion
#### 3.4.1 Proportion of time allocated to each behavior
- Proportion data would show overall changes in vigilance, with increased proportion of vigilance indicating increased perception of risk. If the proportion of time allocated to each behavior is depedent on the frequency of disturbances (risk) then this would support the risk allocation hypothesis
	- Describe effects observations
		- No effects of sentinel could be that the sentinel maintains the required vigilance of the group in the absence of an immediate threat
		- No effects of environment could be that crows forage similarly in both environments, therefore
		- DISTURBANCE DATA!!!
	- Describe implications
		- If there are no differences in proportion, then the individuals could be allocating similar amounts of time/effort into each behavior, but changing the frequency and duration of their bouts.
		- Could be that the allocation of time to each behavior is relatively fixed, supporting the hypothesis that minor modifications in the balance between vigilance and foraging could be done in the frequency and duration of bouts of each behavior.

#### 3.4.2 Peck rate
- Peck rate reflects the foraging effort of an individual. More pecks/unit time could mean more intense foraging, either by a sense of urgency, or increased bait. This could fall in line with the risk allocation hypothesis, where in high-risk environments, individuals may decide to still forage actively in the presence of these threats to satiate their energetic needs. Alternatively, individuals could forage more intensely when food is concentrated in a dense patch (i.e. Bait). If that is true, then the more intense peck rate is explained that way.
	- Describe effects observation
		- No effects detected in the current LMM. Unsure how to explain yet, as I will need to re-analyse the data using the new dataset
		- DISTURBANCE DATA!!!
	- Describe implications
		- If the presence of a sentinel does not affect the peck rate, then it could be that when a sentinel is not present (not needed), then the foragers are foraging optimally. If increased vigilance is needed, then a sentinel can allow the foragers to continue foraging optimally
		- If frequency of disturbance is significant, then the risk allocation hypothesis could be supported depending on the direction of the effect. Both direction could support the risk allocation hypothesis
			- Increased could be a result of a "safe period" in which crows have to forage as intensively as possible in case the threat returns
			- Decreased could be a result of not needing to take unecessary risks. If a threat is present, then it could be better to move to a less risky environment in which to forage in.
		- If bait has an effect, then the concentration of food could result in more effective foraging, with less time required to find and manipulate food.
		- If environment has no effect, then they could be foraging similarly in either environment. Find a better explanation!

#### 3.4.3 Bout Duration
- Individuals could be modifying the frequency and duration of their behaviors to better respond to the perception of their environment. 
	- If vigilance bout duration is increased, it could be a result of caution before fleeing, just as much as it could be looking at other individuals or potential sources of food. If decreased but more frequent, it could imply that crows require more constant vigilance (as opposed to longer, but less frequent) between bouts of non-vigilance.
	- If foraging bout duration is increased, then the individual could perceive the environment as less risky, and therefore could be allocating more energy into foraging. If foraging bouts are decreased in duration, but more frequent, this could be a symptom of the need for increased vigilance, with the least amount of continuous time spent being non-vigilant.
	- If movement bout duration is increased. Then crows could be searching for food across a larger area. This is expected to be affected by the presence of bait.
- This could be the main source of fine modifications to the vigilance-foraging tradeoff.
	- Describe effects observed
		- Crows spend significantly less time with their head’s up than down. 
		- Crows spend significantly less time moving than with their heads down. 
		- The duration of behaviors decreases significantly in the absence of a sentinel. 
		- The duration of behaviors decreases significantly in Commercial areas. 
		- The duration of behaviors decreases significantly in baited sites.
		- There was an interaction between the presence of a sentinel and the generalized environment. (decreased duration)
	- Describe implications
		- Behaviors
			- It could be that vigilance takes less time to be "effective", and less time to perform than head down, where crows could be stacking food to transport away, or breaking up larger chunks. 
			- Likewise, when crows can either move by hopping, walking or flying, then movement can be performed faster than it would take to manipulate food.
				- This also includes the short durations when a crow flies away and out of frame. Could be skewed towards shorter behaviors. 
				- Should I only include ground movement (i.e. walking/hopping)?
			- Head down is the behavior R used to compare the other behaviors to.
		- Sentinel
			- The presence of a sentinel implies the need for a sentinel, therefore the presence of risk to which sentinels can better respond to. That being said, following the assumptions of Bednekoff's model, foraging without a sentinel is more risky than foraging without a sentinel when no threats have been detected (yet). Therefore it is expected to see behaviors increase in duration when a sentinel is present (less need for "constant" vigilance offered by frequent HU/HD)
		- Commercial areas
			- Commercial areas are more busy, unpredictable and therefore require increased consistency of antipredator behavior, even when a sentinel is present. 
			- DISTURBANCE DATA!!! Are disturbances more frequent in commercial areas?
		- Baited sites
			- If food is concentrated in a given area, then it may be more effective to decrease behavior durations (specifically head down, which may shift the behaviors downward)
			- Consider running the interaction between behavior and bout to see if certain behaviors interact more than others. 
				- Prediction: Head Down X Bait significant
		- Interaction between Green areas and the presence of a sentinel decreased the duration of bouts
			- I have no idea how to explain this.
			- Previous logic suggests shorter duration + higher frequency = greater need for vigilance & green areas being "safer" (longer lines of sight therefore more effective vigilance, fewer disturbances, more predictable environments. )
